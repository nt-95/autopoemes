BEGIN NOW The Song of Hiawatha is based on the legends and stories of END
BEGIN NOW many North American Indian tribes, but especially those of the END
BEGIN NOW Ojibway Indians of northern Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. END
BEGIN NOW They were collected by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, the reknowned END
BEGIN NOW Schoolcraft married Jane, O-bah-bahm-wawa-ge-zhe-go-qua (The END

BEGIN NOW Jane and her mother are credited with having researched, END
BEGIN NOW authenticated, and compiled much of the material Schoolcraft END
BEGIN NOW included in his Algic Researches (1839) and a revision published END
BEGIN NOW in 1856 as The Myth of Hiawatha. It was this latter revision END
BEGIN NOW that Longfellow used as the basis for The Song of Hiawatha. END
BEGIN NOW Longfellow began Hiawatha on June 25, 1854, he completed it END
BEGIN NOW soon as the poem was published its popularity was assured. END
BEGIN NOW However, it also was severely criticized as a plagiary of the END
BEGIN NOW Finnish epic poem Kalevala. Longfellow made no secret of the END
BEGIN NOW fact that he had used the meter of the Kalevala; but as for the END
BEGIN NOW legends, he openly gave credit to Schoolcraft in his notes to the END
BEGIN NOW I would add a personal note here. My father's roots include END
BEGIN NOW Ojibway Indians: his mother, Margaret Caroline Davenport, was a END
BEGIN NOW daughter of Susan des Carreaux, O-gee-em-a-qua (The Chief Woman), END
BEGIN NOW Finally, my mother used to rock me to sleep reading portions of END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha to me, especially: END
BEGIN NOW Wah-wah-taysee, little fire-fly, END
BEGIN NOW Little, flitting, white-fire insect END
BEGIN NOW Little, dancing, white-fire creature, END
BEGIN NOW Light me with your little candle, END
BEGIN NOW Ere upon my bed I lay me, END
BEGIN NOW Ere in sleep I close my eyelids! END
BEGIN NOW Should you ask me, whence these stories? END
BEGIN NOW Whence these legends and traditions, END
BEGIN NOW With the odors of the forest END
BEGIN NOW With the dew and damp of meadows, END
BEGIN NOW With the curling smoke of wigwams, END
BEGIN NOW With the rushing of great rivers, END
BEGIN NOW With their frequent repetitions, END
BEGIN NOW And their wild reverberations END
BEGIN NOW As of thunder in the mountains? END
BEGIN NOW I should answer, I should tell you, END
BEGIN NOW From the forests and the prairies, END
BEGIN NOW From the great lakes of the Northland, END
BEGIN NOW From the land of the Ojibways, END
BEGIN NOW From the land of the Dacotahs, END
BEGIN NOW From the mountains, moors, and fen-lands END
BEGIN NOW Where the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah, END
BEGIN NOW Feeds among the reeds and rushes. END
BEGIN NOW I repeat them as I heard them END
BEGIN NOW From the lips of Nawadaha, END
BEGIN NOW The musician, the sweet singer. END
BEGIN NOW Should you ask where Nawadaha END
BEGIN NOW Found these songs so wild and wayward, END
BEGIN NOW Found these legends and traditions, END
BEGIN NOW I should answer, I should tell you, END
BEGIN NOW In the bird's-nests of the forest, END
BEGIN NOW In the lodges of the beaver, END
BEGIN NOW In the hoofprint of the bison, END
BEGIN NOW In the eyry of the eagle! END
BEGIN NOW All the wild-fowl sang them to him, END
BEGIN NOW In the moorlands and the fen-lands, END
BEGIN NOW In the melancholy marshes; END
BEGIN NOW Chetowaik, the plover, sang them, END
BEGIN NOW Mahng, the loon, the wild-goose, Wawa, END
BEGIN NOW The blue heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah, END
BEGIN NOW And the grouse, the Mushkodasa! END
BEGIN NOW If still further you should ask me, END
BEGIN NOW Tell us of this Nawadaha, END
BEGIN NOW I should answer your inquiries END
BEGIN NOW Straightway in such words as follow. END
BEGIN NOW In the vale of Tawasentha, END
BEGIN NOW In the green and silent valley, END
BEGIN NOW By the pleasant water-courses, END
BEGIN NOW Dwelt the singer Nawadaha. END
BEGIN NOW Round about the Indian village END
BEGIN NOW Spread the meadows and the corn-fields, END
BEGIN NOW And beyond them stood the forest, END
BEGIN NOW Stood the groves of singing pine-trees, END
BEGIN NOW Green in Summer, white in Winter, END
BEGIN NOW Ever sighing, ever singing. END
BEGIN NOW And the pleasant water-courses, END
BEGIN NOW You could trace them through the valley, END
BEGIN NOW By the rushing in the Spring-time, END
BEGIN NOW By the alders in the Summer, END
BEGIN NOW By the white fog in the Autumn, END
BEGIN NOW By the black line in the Winter; END
BEGIN NOW And beside them dwelt the singer, END
BEGIN NOW In the vale of Tawasentha, END
BEGIN NOW In the green and silent valley. END
BEGIN NOW There he sang of Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Sang his wondrous birth and being, END
BEGIN NOW How he prayed and how be fasted, END
BEGIN NOW How he lived, and toiled, and suffered, END
BEGIN NOW That the tribes of men might prosper, END
BEGIN NOW That he might advance his people! END
BEGIN NOW Ye who love the haunts of Nature, END
BEGIN NOW Love the sunshine of the meadow, END
BEGIN NOW Love the shadow of the forest, END
BEGIN NOW Love the wind among the branches, END
BEGIN NOW And the rain-shower and the snow-storm, END
BEGIN NOW And the rushing of great rivers END
BEGIN NOW Through their palisades of pine-trees, END
BEGIN NOW And the thunder in the mountains, END
BEGIN NOW Whose innumerable echoes END
BEGIN NOW Flap like eagles in their eyries;-- END
BEGIN NOW Listen to these wild traditions, END
BEGIN NOW To this Song of Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW Ye who love a nation's legends, END
BEGIN NOW Love the ballads of a people, END
BEGIN NOW That like voices from afar off END
BEGIN NOW Call to us to pause and listen, END
BEGIN NOW Speak in tones so plain and childlike, END
BEGIN NOW Scarcely can the ear distinguish END
BEGIN NOW Whether they are sung or spoken;-- END
BEGIN NOW Listen to this Indian Legend, END
BEGIN NOW To this Song of Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple, END
BEGIN NOW Who have faith in God and Nature, END
BEGIN NOW Who believe that in all ages END
BEGIN NOW Every human heart is human, END
BEGIN NOW That in even savage bosoms END
BEGIN NOW There are longings, yearnings, strivings END
BEGIN NOW For the good they comprehend not, END
BEGIN NOW That the feeble hands and helpless, END
BEGIN NOW Groping blindly in the darkness, END
BEGIN NOW Touch God's right hand in that darkness END
BEGIN NOW And are lifted up and strengthened;-- END
BEGIN NOW Listen to this simple story, END
BEGIN NOW To this Song of Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW Ye, who sometimes, in your rambles END
BEGIN NOW Through the green lanes of the country, END
BEGIN NOW Where the tangled barberry-bushes END
BEGIN NOW Hang their tufts of crimson berries END
BEGIN NOW Over stone walls gray with mosses, END
BEGIN NOW Pause by some neglected graveyard, END
BEGIN NOW For a while to muse, and ponder END
BEGIN NOW On a half-effaced inscription, END
BEGIN NOW Written with little skill of song-craft, END
BEGIN NOW Homely phrases, but each letter END
BEGIN NOW Full of hope and yet of heart-break, END
BEGIN NOW Full of all the tender pathos END
BEGIN NOW Stay and read this rude inscription, END
BEGIN NOW Read this Song of Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW On the great Red Pipe-stone Quarry, END
BEGIN NOW Gitche Manito, the mighty, END
BEGIN NOW He the Master of Life, descending, END
BEGIN NOW On the red crags of the quarry END
BEGIN NOW Stood erect, and called the nations, END
BEGIN NOW Called the tribes of men together. END
BEGIN NOW From his footprints flowed a river, END
BEGIN NOW Leaped into the light of morning, END
BEGIN NOW O'er the precipice plunging downward END
BEGIN NOW Gleamed like Ishkoodah, the comet. END
BEGIN NOW And the Spirit, stooping earthward, END
BEGIN NOW With his finger on the meadow END
BEGIN NOW Traced a winding pathway for it, END
BEGIN NOW Saying to it, "Run in this way! END
BEGIN NOW From the red stone of the quarry END
BEGIN NOW With his hand he broke a fragment, END
BEGIN NOW Moulded it into a pipe-head, END
BEGIN NOW Shaped and fashioned it with figures; END
BEGIN NOW From the margin of the river END
BEGIN NOW Took a long reed for a pipe-stem, END
BEGIN NOW With its dark green leaves upon it; END
BEGIN NOW Filled the pipe with bark of willow, END
BEGIN NOW With the bark of the red willow; END
BEGIN NOW Breathed upon the neighboring forest, END
BEGIN NOW Made its great boughs chafe together, END
BEGIN NOW Till in flame they burst and kindled; END
BEGIN NOW And erect upon the mountains, END
BEGIN NOW Gitche Manito, the mighty, END
BEGIN NOW Smoked the calumet, the Peace-Pipe, END
BEGIN NOW As a signal to the nations. END
BEGIN NOW And the smoke rose slowly, slowly, END
BEGIN NOW Through the tranquil air of morning, END
BEGIN NOW First a single line of darkness, END
BEGIN NOW Then a denser, bluer vapor, END
BEGIN NOW Then a snow-white cloud unfolding, END
BEGIN NOW Like the tree-tops of the forest, END
BEGIN NOW Ever rising, rising, rising, END
BEGIN NOW Till it touched the top of heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Till it broke against the heaven, END
BEGIN NOW And rolled outward all around it. END
BEGIN NOW From the groves of Tuscaloosa, END
BEGIN NOW From the far-off Rocky Mountains, END
BEGIN NOW From the Northern lakes and rivers END
BEGIN NOW All the tribes beheld the signal, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the distant smoke ascending, END
BEGIN NOW And the Prophets of the nations END
BEGIN NOW By the signal of the Peace-Pipe, END
BEGIN NOW Bending like a wand of willow, END
BEGIN NOW Waving like a hand that beckons, END
BEGIN NOW Gitche Manito, the mighty, END
BEGIN NOW Calls the tribes of men together, END
BEGIN NOW Calls the warriors to his council! END
BEGIN NOW Down the rivers, o'er the prairies, END
BEGIN NOW Came the warriors of the nations, END
BEGIN NOW All the warriors drawn together END
BEGIN NOW By the signal of the Peace-Pipe, END
BEGIN NOW To the great Red Pipe-stone Quarry, END
BEGIN NOW And they stood there on the meadow, END
BEGIN NOW With their weapons and their war-gear, END
BEGIN NOW Painted like the leaves of Autumn, END
BEGIN NOW Painted like the sky of morning, END
BEGIN NOW Wildly glaring at each other; END
BEGIN NOW In their faces stern defiance, END
BEGIN NOW In their hearts the feuds of ages, END
BEGIN NOW The hereditary hatred, END
BEGIN NOW The ancestral thirst of vengeance. END
BEGIN NOW Gitche Manito, the mighty, END
BEGIN NOW The creator of the nations, END
BEGIN NOW Looked upon them with compassion, END
BEGIN NOW With paternal love and pity; END
BEGIN NOW Looked upon their wrath and wrangling END
BEGIN NOW But as quarrels among children, END
BEGIN NOW But as feuds and fights of children! END
BEGIN NOW Over them he stretched his right hand, END
BEGIN NOW To subdue their stubborn natures, END
BEGIN NOW To allay their thirst and fever, END
BEGIN NOW By the shadow of his right hand; END
BEGIN NOW Spake to them with voice majestic END
BEGIN NOW As the sound of far-off waters, END
BEGIN NOW Falling into deep abysses, END
BEGIN NOW Warning, chiding, spake in this wise: END
BEGIN NOW O my children! my poor children! END
BEGIN NOW Listen to the words of wisdom, END
BEGIN NOW Listen to the words of warning, END
BEGIN NOW From the lips of the Great Spirit, END
BEGIN NOW From the Master of Life, who made you! END
BEGIN NOW I have given you lands to hunt in, END
BEGIN NOW I have given you streams to fish in, END
BEGIN NOW I have given you bear and bison, END
BEGIN NOW I have given you roe and reindeer, END
BEGIN NOW I have given you brant and beaver, END
BEGIN NOW Filled the marshes full of wild-fowl, END
BEGIN NOW Filled the rivers full of fishes: END
BEGIN NOW Why then are you not contented? END
BEGIN NOW Why then will you hunt each other? END
BEGIN NOW I am weary of your quarrels, END
BEGIN NOW Weary of your wars and bloodshed, END
BEGIN NOW Weary of your prayers for vengeance, END
BEGIN NOW Of your wranglings and dissensions; END
BEGIN NOW All your strength is in your union, END
BEGIN NOW All your danger is in discord; END
BEGIN NOW Therefore be at peace henceforward, END
BEGIN NOW And as brothers live together. END
BEGIN NOW I will send a Prophet to you, END
BEGIN NOW A Deliverer of the nations, END
BEGIN NOW Who shall guide you and shall teach you, END
BEGIN NOW Who shall toil and suffer with you. END
BEGIN NOW If you listen to his counsels, END
BEGIN NOW You will multiply and prosper; END
BEGIN NOW If his warnings pass unheeded, END
BEGIN NOW You will fade away and perish! END
BEGIN NOW Bathe now in the stream before you, END
BEGIN NOW Wash the war-paint from your faces, END
BEGIN NOW Wash the blood-stains from your fingers, END
BEGIN NOW Bury your war-clubs and your weapons, END
BEGIN NOW Break the red stone from this quarry, END
BEGIN NOW Mould and make it into Peace-Pipes, END
BEGIN NOW Take the reeds that grow beside you, END
BEGIN NOW Deck them with your brightest feathers, END
BEGIN NOW Smoke the calumet together, END
BEGIN NOW And as brothers live henceforward! END
BEGIN NOW Then upon the ground the warriors END
BEGIN NOW Threw their cloaks and shirts of deer-skin, END
BEGIN NOW Threw their weapons and their war-gear, END
BEGIN NOW Leaped into the rushing river, END
BEGIN NOW Washed the war-paint from their faces. END
BEGIN NOW Clear above them flowed the water, END
BEGIN NOW Clear and limpid from the footprints END
BEGIN NOW Of the Master of Life descending; END
BEGIN NOW Dark below them flowed the water, END
BEGIN NOW Soiled and stained with streaks of crimson, END
BEGIN NOW As if blood were mingled with it! END
BEGIN NOW From the river came the warriors, END
BEGIN NOW Clean and washed from all their war-paint; END
BEGIN NOW On the banks their clubs they buried, END
BEGIN NOW Buried all their warlike weapons. END
BEGIN NOW Gitche Manito, the mighty, END
BEGIN NOW The Great Spirit, the creator, END
BEGIN NOW Smiled upon his helpless children! END
BEGIN NOW And in silence all the warriors END
BEGIN NOW Broke the red stone of the quarry, END
BEGIN NOW Smoothed and formed it into Peace-Pipes, END
BEGIN NOW Broke the long reeds by the river, END
BEGIN NOW Decked them with their brightest feathers, END
BEGIN NOW And departed each one homeward, END
BEGIN NOW While the Master of Life, ascending, END
BEGIN NOW Through the opening of cloud-curtains, END
BEGIN NOW Through the doorways of the heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Vanished from before their faces, END
BEGIN NOW In the smoke that rolled around him, END
BEGIN NOW Cried the warriors, cried the old men, END
BEGIN NOW When he came in triumph homeward END
BEGIN NOW With the sacred Belt of Wampum, END
BEGIN NOW From the regions of the North-Wind, END
BEGIN NOW From the kingdom of Wabasso, END
BEGIN NOW From the land of the White Rabbit. END
BEGIN NOW He had stolen the Belt of Wampum END
BEGIN NOW From the neck of Mishe-Mokwa, END
BEGIN NOW From the Great Bear of the mountains, END
BEGIN NOW From the terror of the nations, END
BEGIN NOW As he lay asleep and cumbrous END
BEGIN NOW On the summit of the mountains, END
BEGIN NOW Like a rock with mosses on it, END
BEGIN NOW Spotted brown and gray with mosses. END
BEGIN NOW Silently he stole upon him END
BEGIN NOW Till the red nails of the monster END
BEGIN NOW Almost touched him, almost scared him, END
BEGIN NOW Till the hot breath of his nostrils END
BEGIN NOW Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis, END
BEGIN NOW As he drew the Belt of Wampum END
BEGIN NOW Over the round ears, that heard not, END
BEGIN NOW Over the small eyes, that saw not, END
BEGIN NOW Over the long nose and nostrils, END
BEGIN NOW The black muffle of the nostrils, END
BEGIN NOW Out of which the heavy breathing END
BEGIN NOW Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis. END
BEGIN NOW Then he swung aloft his war-club, END
BEGIN NOW Shouted loud and long his war-cry, END
BEGIN NOW Smote the mighty Mishe-Mokwa END
BEGIN NOW In the middle of the forehead, END
BEGIN NOW Right between the eyes he smote him. END
BEGIN NOW With the heavy blow bewildered, END
BEGIN NOW Rose the Great Bear of the mountains; END
BEGIN NOW But his knees beneath him trembled, END
BEGIN NOW And he whimpered like a woman, END
BEGIN NOW As he reeled and staggered forward, END
BEGIN NOW As he sat upon his haunches; END
BEGIN NOW And the mighty Mudjekeewis, END
BEGIN NOW Standing fearlessly before him, END
BEGIN NOW Taunted him in loud derision, END
BEGIN NOW Spake disdainfully in this wise: END
BEGIN NOW Hark you, Bear! you are a coward; END
BEGIN NOW And no Brave, as you pretended; END
BEGIN NOW Else you would not cry and whimper END
BEGIN NOW Like a miserable woman! END
BEGIN NOW Bear! you know our tribes are hostile, END
BEGIN NOW Long have been at war together; END
BEGIN NOW Now you find that we are strongest, END
BEGIN NOW You go sneaking in the forest, END
BEGIN NOW You go hiding in the mountains! END
BEGIN NOW Had you conquered me in battle END
BEGIN NOW Not a groan would I have uttered; END
BEGIN NOW But you, Bear! sit here and whimper, END
BEGIN NOW And disgrace your tribe by crying, END
BEGIN NOW Like a wretched Shaugodaya, END
BEGIN NOW Like a cowardly old woman! END
BEGIN NOW Then again he raised his war-club, END
BEGIN NOW Smote again the Mishe-Mokwa END
BEGIN NOW In the middle of his forehead, END
BEGIN NOW Broke his skull, as ice is broken END
BEGIN NOW When one goes to fish in Winter. END
BEGIN NOW Thus was slain the Mishe-Mokwa, END
BEGIN NOW He the Great Bear of the mountains, END
BEGIN NOW He the terror of the nations. END
BEGIN NOW With a shout exclaimed the people, END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth he shall be the West-Wind, END
BEGIN NOW And hereafter and forever END
BEGIN NOW Shall he hold supreme dominion END
BEGIN NOW Over all the winds of heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Call him no more Mudjekeewis, END
BEGIN NOW Thus was Mudjekeewis chosen END
BEGIN NOW For himself he kept the West-Wind, END
BEGIN NOW Gave the others to his children; END
BEGIN NOW Unto Wabun gave the East-Wind, END
BEGIN NOW And the North-Wind, wild and cruel, END
BEGIN NOW To the fierce Kabibonokka. END
BEGIN NOW Young and beautiful was Wabun; END
BEGIN NOW He it was who brought the morning, END
BEGIN NOW He it was whose silver arrows END
BEGIN NOW Chased the dark o'er hill and valley; END
BEGIN NOW He it was whose cheeks were painted END
BEGIN NOW With the brightest streaks of crimson, END
BEGIN NOW And whose voice awoke the village, END
BEGIN NOW Called the deer, and called the hunter. END
BEGIN NOW Though the birds sang gayly to him, END
BEGIN NOW Though the wild-flowers of the meadow END
BEGIN NOW Filled the air with odors for him; END
BEGIN NOW Though the forests and the rivers END
BEGIN NOW Sang and shouted at his coming, END
BEGIN NOW Still his heart was sad within him, END
BEGIN NOW For he was alone in heaven. END
BEGIN NOW But one morning, gazing earthward, END
BEGIN NOW While the village still was sleeping, END
BEGIN NOW And the fog lay on the river, END
BEGIN NOW Like a ghost, that goes at sunrise, END
BEGIN NOW He beheld a maiden walking END
BEGIN NOW All alone upon a meadow, END
BEGIN NOW Gathering water-flags and rushes END
BEGIN NOW By a river in the meadow. END
BEGIN NOW Every morning, gazing earthward, END
BEGIN NOW Still the first thing he beheld there END
BEGIN NOW Was her blue eyes looking at him, END
BEGIN NOW Two blue lakes among the rushes. END
BEGIN NOW And he loved the lonely maiden, END
BEGIN NOW Who thus waited for his coming; END
BEGIN NOW For they both were solitary, END
BEGIN NOW She on earth and he in heaven. END
BEGIN NOW And he wooed her with caresses, END
BEGIN NOW Wooed her with his smile of sunshine, END
BEGIN NOW With his flattering words he wooed her, END
BEGIN NOW With his sighing and his singing, END
BEGIN NOW Gentlest whispers in the branches, END
BEGIN NOW Softest music, sweetest odors, END
BEGIN NOW Till he drew her to his bosom, END
BEGIN NOW Folded in his robes of crimson, END
BEGIN NOW Till into a star he changed her, END
BEGIN NOW Trembling still upon his bosom; END
BEGIN NOW And forever in the heavens END
BEGIN NOW They are seen together walking, END
BEGIN NOW But the fierce Kabibonokka END
BEGIN NOW Had his dwelling among icebergs, END
BEGIN NOW In the everlasting snow-drifts, END
BEGIN NOW In the kingdom of Wabasso, END
BEGIN NOW In the land of the White Rabbit. END
BEGIN NOW He it was whose hand in Autumn END
BEGIN NOW Painted all the trees with scarlet, END
BEGIN NOW Stained the leaves with red and yellow; END
BEGIN NOW He it was who sent the snow-flake, END
BEGIN NOW Sifting, hissing through the forest, END
BEGIN NOW Froze the ponds, the lakes, the rivers, END
BEGIN NOW Drove the loon and sea-gull southward, END
BEGIN NOW Drove the cormorant and curlew END
BEGIN NOW To their nests of sedge and sea-tang END
BEGIN NOW In the realms of Shawondasee. END
BEGIN NOW Once the fierce Kabibonokka END
BEGIN NOW Issued from his lodge of snow-drifts END
BEGIN NOW From his home among the icebergs, END
BEGIN NOW And his hair, with snow besprinkled, END
BEGIN NOW Streamed behind him like a river, END
BEGIN NOW Like a black and wintry river, END
BEGIN NOW As he howled and hurried southward, END
BEGIN NOW Over frozen lakes and moorlands. END
BEGIN NOW There among the reeds and rushes END
BEGIN NOW Found he Shingebis, the diver, END
BEGIN NOW Trailing strings of fish behind him, END
BEGIN NOW O'er the frozen fens and moorlands, END
BEGIN NOW Lingering still among the moorlands, END
BEGIN NOW Though his tribe had long departed END
BEGIN NOW To the land of Shawondasee. END
BEGIN NOW Cried the fierce Kabibonokka, END
BEGIN NOW Who is this that dares to brave me? END
BEGIN NOW Dares to stay in my dominions, END
BEGIN NOW When the Wawa has departed, END
BEGIN NOW When the wild-goose has gone southward, END
BEGIN NOW And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah, END
BEGIN NOW Long ago departed southward? END
BEGIN NOW I will go into his wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW I will put his smouldering fire out! END
BEGIN NOW And at night Kabibonokka, END
BEGIN NOW To the lodge came wild and wailing, END
BEGIN NOW Heaped the snow in drifts about it, END
BEGIN NOW Shouted down into the smoke-flue, END
BEGIN NOW Shook the lodge-poles in his fury, END
BEGIN NOW Flapped the curtain of the door-way. END
BEGIN NOW Shingebis, the diver, feared not, END
BEGIN NOW Shingebis, the diver, cared not; END
BEGIN NOW Four great logs had he for firewood, END
BEGIN NOW One for each moon of the winter, END
BEGIN NOW And for food the fishes served him. END
BEGIN NOW By his blazing fire he sat there, END
BEGIN NOW Warm and merry, eating, laughing, END
BEGIN NOW You are but my fellow-mortal! END
BEGIN NOW Then Kabibonokka entered, END
BEGIN NOW And though Shingebis, the diver, END
BEGIN NOW Felt his presence by the coldness, END
BEGIN NOW Felt his icy breath upon him, END
BEGIN NOW Still he did not cease his singing, END
BEGIN NOW Still he did not leave his laughing, END
BEGIN NOW Only turned the log a little, END
BEGIN NOW Only made the fire burn brighter, END
BEGIN NOW Made the sparks fly up the smoke-flue. END
BEGIN NOW From Kabibonokka's forehead, END
BEGIN NOW From his snow-besprinkled tresses, END
BEGIN NOW Drops of sweat fell fast and heavy, END
BEGIN NOW Making dints upon the ashes, END
BEGIN NOW As along the eaves of lodges, END
BEGIN NOW As from drooping boughs of hemlock, END
BEGIN NOW Drips the melting snow in spring-time, END
BEGIN NOW Making hollows in the snow-drifts. END
BEGIN NOW Till at last he rose defeated, END
BEGIN NOW Could not bear the heat and laughter, END
BEGIN NOW Could not bear the merry singing, END
BEGIN NOW But rushed headlong through the door-way, END
BEGIN NOW Stamped upon the crusted snow-drifts, END
BEGIN NOW Stamped upon the lakes and rivers, END
BEGIN NOW Made the snow upon them harder, END
BEGIN NOW Made the ice upon them thicker, END
BEGIN NOW Challenged Shingebis, the diver, END
BEGIN NOW To come forth and wrestle with him, END
BEGIN NOW To come forth and wrestle naked END
BEGIN NOW On the frozen fens and moorlands. END
BEGIN NOW Forth went Shingebis, the diver, END
BEGIN NOW Wrestled all night with the North-Wind, END
BEGIN NOW Wrestled naked on the moorlands END
BEGIN NOW With the fierce Kabibonokka, END
BEGIN NOW Till his panting breath grew fainter, END
BEGIN NOW Till his frozen grasp grew feebler, END
BEGIN NOW Till he reeled and staggered backward, END
BEGIN NOW And retreated, baffled, beaten, END
BEGIN NOW To the kingdom of Wabasso, END
BEGIN NOW To the land of the White Rabbit, END
BEGIN NOW Hearing still the gusty laughter, END
BEGIN NOW Hearing Shingebis, the diver, END
BEGIN NOW You are but my fellow-mortal! END
BEGIN NOW Shawondasee, fat and lazy, END
BEGIN NOW Had his dwelling far to southward, END
BEGIN NOW In the drowsy, dreamy sunshine, END
BEGIN NOW In the never-ending Summer. END
BEGIN NOW He it was who sent the wood-birds, END
BEGIN NOW Sent the robin, the Opechee, END
BEGIN NOW Sent the bluebird, the Owaissa, END
BEGIN NOW Sent the Shawshaw, sent the swallow, END
BEGIN NOW Sent the wild-goose, Wawa, northward, END
BEGIN NOW Sent the melons and tobacco, END
BEGIN NOW And the grapes in purple clusters. END
BEGIN NOW From his pipe the smoke ascending END
BEGIN NOW Filled the sky with haze and vapor, END
BEGIN NOW Filled the air with dreamy softness, END
BEGIN NOW Gave a twinkle to the water, END
BEGIN NOW Touched the rugged hills with smoothness, END
BEGIN NOW Brought the tender Indian Summer END
BEGIN NOW To the melancholy north-land, END
BEGIN NOW In the dreary Moon of Snow-shoes. END
BEGIN NOW Listless, careless Shawondasee! END
BEGIN NOW In his life he had one shadow, END
BEGIN NOW In his heart one sorrow had he. END
BEGIN NOW Once, as he was gazing northward, END
BEGIN NOW Far away upon a prairie END
BEGIN NOW He beheld a maiden standing, END
BEGIN NOW Saw a tall and slender maiden END
BEGIN NOW All alone upon a prairie; END
BEGIN NOW Brightest green were all her garments, END
BEGIN NOW And her hair was like the sunshine. END
BEGIN NOW Day by day he gazed upon her, END
BEGIN NOW Day by day he sighed with passion, END
BEGIN NOW Day by day his heart within him END
BEGIN NOW Grew more hot with love and longing END
BEGIN NOW For the maid with yellow tresses. END
BEGIN NOW But he was too fat and lazy END
BEGIN NOW To bestir himself and woo her. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, too indolent and easy END
BEGIN NOW To pursue her and persuade her; END
BEGIN NOW So he only gazed upon her, END
BEGIN NOW Only sat and sighed with passion END
BEGIN NOW For the maiden of the prairie. END
BEGIN NOW Till one morning, looking northward, END
BEGIN NOW He beheld her yellow tresses END
BEGIN NOW Changed and covered o'er with whiteness, END
BEGIN NOW Covered as with whitest snow-flakes. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! my brother from the North-land, END
BEGIN NOW From the kingdom of Wabasso, END
BEGIN NOW From the land of the White Rabbit! END
BEGIN NOW You have stolen the maiden from me, END
BEGIN NOW You have laid your hand upon her, END
BEGIN NOW You have wooed and won my maiden, END
BEGIN NOW With your stories of the North-land! END
BEGIN NOW Thus the wretched Shawondasee END
BEGIN NOW Breathed into the air his sorrow; END
BEGIN NOW And the South-Wind o'er the prairie END
BEGIN NOW Wandered warm with sighs of passion, END
BEGIN NOW With the sighs of Shawondasee, END
BEGIN NOW Till the air seemed full of snow-flakes, END
BEGIN NOW Full of thistle-down the prairie, END
BEGIN NOW And the maid with hair like sunshine END
BEGIN NOW Vanished from his sight forever; END
BEGIN NOW Never more did Shawondasee END
BEGIN NOW See the maid with yellow tresses! END
BEGIN NOW Poor, deluded Shawondasee! END
BEGIN NOW 'T was no woman that you gazed at, END
BEGIN NOW 'T was no maiden that you sighed for, END
BEGIN NOW 'T was the prairie dandelion END
BEGIN NOW That through all the dreamy Summer END
BEGIN NOW You had gazed at with such longing, END
BEGIN NOW You had sighed for with such passion, END
BEGIN NOW And had puffed away forever, END
BEGIN NOW Blown into the air with sighing. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! deluded Shawondasee! END
BEGIN NOW Thus the Four Winds were divided END
BEGIN NOW Thus the sons of Mudjekeewis END
BEGIN NOW Had their stations in the heavens, END
BEGIN NOW At the corners of the heavens; END
BEGIN NOW For himself the West-Wind only END
BEGIN NOW Kept the mighty Mudjekeewis. END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha's Childhood END
BEGIN NOW Downward through the evening twilight, END
BEGIN NOW In the days that are forgotten, END
BEGIN NOW In the unremembered ages, END
BEGIN NOW From the full moon fell Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW Fell the beautiful Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW She a wife, but not a mother. END
BEGIN NOW She was sporting with her women, END
BEGIN NOW Swinging in a swing of grape-vines, END
BEGIN NOW When her rival the rejected, END
BEGIN NOW Full of jealousy and hatred, END
BEGIN NOW Cut the leafy swing asunder, END
BEGIN NOW Cut in twain the twisted grape-vines, END
BEGIN NOW And Nokomis fell affrighted END
BEGIN NOW Downward through the evening twilight, END
BEGIN NOW On the Muskoday, the meadow, END
BEGIN NOW On the prairie full of blossoms. END
BEGIN NOW See! a star falls!" said the people; END
BEGIN NOW From the sky a star is falling! END
BEGIN NOW There among the ferns and mosses, END
BEGIN NOW There among the prairie lilies, END
BEGIN NOW On the Muskoday, the meadow, END
BEGIN NOW In the moonlight and the starlight, END
BEGIN NOW Fair Nokomis bore a daughter. END
BEGIN NOW And she called her name Wenonah, END
BEGIN NOW As the first-born of her daughters. END
BEGIN NOW And the daughter of Nokomis END
BEGIN NOW Grew up like the prairie lilies, END
BEGIN NOW Grew a tall and slender maiden, END
BEGIN NOW With the beauty of the moonlight, END
BEGIN NOW With the beauty of the starlight. END
BEGIN NOW And Nokomis warned her often, END
BEGIN NOW Saying oft, and oft repeating, END
BEGIN NOW Oh, beware of Mudjekeewis, END
BEGIN NOW Listen not to what he tells you; END
BEGIN NOW Lie not down upon the meadow, END
BEGIN NOW Stoop not down among the lilies, END
BEGIN NOW Lest the West-Wind come and harm you! END
BEGIN NOW But she heeded not the warning, END
BEGIN NOW Heeded not those words of wisdom, END
BEGIN NOW And the West-Wind came at evening, END
BEGIN NOW Walking lightly o'er the prairie, END
BEGIN NOW Whispering to the leaves and blossoms, END
BEGIN NOW Bending low the flowers and grasses, END
BEGIN NOW Found the beautiful Wenonah, END
BEGIN NOW Lying there among the lilies, END
BEGIN NOW Wooed her with his words of sweetness, END
BEGIN NOW Wooed her with his soft caresses, END
BEGIN NOW Till she bore a son in sorrow, END
BEGIN NOW Bore a son of love and sorrow. END
BEGIN NOW Thus was born my Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Thus was born the child of wonder; END
BEGIN NOW But the daughter of Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha's gentle mother, END
BEGIN NOW In her anguish died deserted END
BEGIN NOW By the West-Wind, false and faithless, END
BEGIN NOW By the heartless Mudjekeewis. END
BEGIN NOW For her daughter long and loudly END
BEGIN NOW Wailed and wept the sad Nokomis; END
BEGIN NOW Oh that I were dead!" she murmured, END
BEGIN NOW Oh that I were dead, as thou art! END
BEGIN NOW No more work, and no more weeping, END
BEGIN NOW By the shores of Gitche Gumee, END
BEGIN NOW By the shining Big-Sea-Water, END
BEGIN NOW Stood the wigwam of Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW Dark behind it rose the forest, END
BEGIN NOW Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees, END
BEGIN NOW Rose the firs with cones upon them; END
BEGIN NOW Bright before it beat the water, END
BEGIN NOW Beat the clear and sunny water, END
BEGIN NOW Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water. END
BEGIN NOW There the wrinkled old Nokomis END
BEGIN NOW Nursed the little Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Rocked him in his linden cradle, END
BEGIN NOW Bedded soft in moss and rushes, END
BEGIN NOW Safely bound with reindeer sinews; END
BEGIN NOW Stilled his fretful wail by saying, END
BEGIN NOW Hush! the Naked Bear will hear thee! END
BEGIN NOW Lulled him into slumber, singing, END
BEGIN NOW Ewa-yea! my little owlet! END
BEGIN NOW Who is this, that lights the wigwam? END
BEGIN NOW With his great eyes lights the wigwam? END
BEGIN NOW Ewa-yea! my little owlet! END
BEGIN NOW Many things Nokomis taught him END
BEGIN NOW Of the stars that shine in heaven; END
BEGIN NOW Showed him Ishkoodah, the comet, END
BEGIN NOW Ishkoodah, with fiery tresses; END
BEGIN NOW Showed the Death-Dance of the spirits, END
BEGIN NOW Warriors with their plumes and war-clubs, END
BEGIN NOW Flaring far away to northward END
BEGIN NOW In the frosty nights of Winter; END
BEGIN NOW Showed the broad white road in heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Pathway of the ghosts, the shadows, END
BEGIN NOW Running straight across the heavens, END
BEGIN NOW Crowded with the ghosts, the shadows. END
BEGIN NOW At the door on summer evenings END
BEGIN NOW Sat the little Hiawatha; END
BEGIN NOW Heard the whispering of the pine-trees, END
BEGIN NOW Heard the lapping of the waters, END
BEGIN NOW Sounds of music, words of wonder; END
BEGIN NOW Minne-wawa! said the Pine-trees, END
BEGIN NOW Mudway-aushka! said the water. END
BEGIN NOW Saw the fire-fly, Wah-wah-taysee, END
BEGIN NOW Flitting through the dusk of evening, END
BEGIN NOW With the twinkle of its candle END
BEGIN NOW Lighting up the brakes and bushes, END
BEGIN NOW And he sang the song of children, END
BEGIN NOW Sang the song Nokomis taught him: END
BEGIN NOW Wah-wah-taysee, little fire-fly, END
BEGIN NOW Little, flitting, white-fire insect, END
BEGIN NOW Little, dancing, white-fire creature, END
BEGIN NOW Light me with your little candle, END
BEGIN NOW Ere upon my bed I lay me, END
BEGIN NOW Ere in sleep I close my eyelids! END
BEGIN NOW Saw the moon rise from the water END
BEGIN NOW Rippling, rounding from the water, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the flecks and shadows on it, END
BEGIN NOW Whispered, "What is that, Nokomis? END
BEGIN NOW And the good Nokomis answered: END
BEGIN NOW Once a warrior, very angry, END
BEGIN NOW Seized his grandmother, and threw her END
BEGIN NOW Up into the sky at midnight; END
BEGIN NOW Right against the moon he threw her; END
BEGIN NOW 'T is her body that you see there. END
BEGIN NOW Saw the rainbow in the heaven, END
BEGIN NOW In the eastern sky, the rainbow, END
BEGIN NOW Whispered, "What is that, Nokomis? END
BEGIN NOW And the good Nokomis answered: END
BEGIN NOW 'T is the heaven of flowers you see there; END
BEGIN NOW All the wild-flowers of the forest, END
BEGIN NOW All the lilies of the prairie, END
BEGIN NOW When on earth they fade and perish, END
BEGIN NOW Blossom in that heaven above us. END
BEGIN NOW When he heard the owls at midnight, END
BEGIN NOW Hooting, laughing in the forest, END
BEGIN NOW What is that?" he cried in terror, END
BEGIN NOW What is that," he said, Nokomis? END
BEGIN NOW And the good Nokomis answered: END
BEGIN NOW That is but the owl and owlet, END
BEGIN NOW Talking in their native language, END
BEGIN NOW Talking, scolding at each other. END
BEGIN NOW Then the little Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Learned of every bird its language, END
BEGIN NOW Learned their names and all their secrets, END
BEGIN NOW How they built their nests in Summer, END
BEGIN NOW Where they hid themselves in Winter, END
BEGIN NOW Talked with them whene'er he met them, END
BEGIN NOW Called them "Hiawatha's Chickens. END
BEGIN NOW Of all beasts he learned the language, END
BEGIN NOW Learned their names and all their secrets, END
BEGIN NOW How the beavers built their lodges, END
BEGIN NOW Where the squirrels hid their acorns, END
BEGIN NOW How the reindeer ran so swiftly, END
BEGIN NOW Why the rabbit was so timid, END
BEGIN NOW Talked with them whene'er he met them, END
BEGIN NOW Called them "Hiawatha's Brothers. END
BEGIN NOW Then Iagoo, the great boaster, END
BEGIN NOW He the marvellous story-teller, END
BEGIN NOW He the traveller and the talker, END
BEGIN NOW He the friend of old Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW From a branch of ash he made it, END
BEGIN NOW From an oak-bough made the arrows, END
BEGIN NOW Tipped with flint, and winged with feathers, END
BEGIN NOW And the cord he made of deer-skin. END
BEGIN NOW Then he said to Hiawatha: END
BEGIN NOW Go, my son, into the forest, END
BEGIN NOW Where the red deer herd together, END
BEGIN NOW Kill for us a famous roebuck, END
BEGIN NOW Kill for us a deer with antlers! END
BEGIN NOW Forth into the forest straightway END
BEGIN NOW All alone walked Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Proudly, with his bow and arrows; END
BEGIN NOW And the birds sang round him, o'er him, END
BEGIN NOW Do not shoot us, Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW Sang the robin, the Opechee, END
BEGIN NOW Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa, END
BEGIN NOW Do not shoot us, Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW Up the oak-tree, close beside him, END
BEGIN NOW Sprang the squirrel, Adjidaumo, END
BEGIN NOW In and out among the branches, END
BEGIN NOW Coughed and chattered from the oak-tree, END
BEGIN NOW Laughed, and said between his laughing, END
BEGIN NOW Do not shoot me, Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW And the rabbit from his pathway END
BEGIN NOW Leaped aside, and at a distance END
BEGIN NOW Sat erect upon his haunches, END
BEGIN NOW Half in fear and half in frolic, END
BEGIN NOW Saying to the little hunter, END
BEGIN NOW Do not shoot me, Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW But he heeded not, nor heard them, END
BEGIN NOW For his thoughts were with the red deer; END
BEGIN NOW On their tracks his eyes were fastened, END
BEGIN NOW Leading downward to the river, END
BEGIN NOW To the ford across the river, END
BEGIN NOW And as one in slumber walked he. END
BEGIN NOW Hidden in the alder-bushes, END
BEGIN NOW There he waited till the deer came, END
BEGIN NOW Till he saw two antlers lifted, END
BEGIN NOW Saw two eyes look from the thicket, END
BEGIN NOW Saw two nostrils point to windward, END
BEGIN NOW And a deer came down the pathway, END
BEGIN NOW Flecked with leafy light and shadow. END
BEGIN NOW And his heart within him fluttered, END
BEGIN NOW Trembled like the leaves above him, END
BEGIN NOW Like the birch-leaf palpitated, END
BEGIN NOW As the deer came down the pathway. END
BEGIN NOW Then, upon one knee uprising, END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha aimed an arrow; END
BEGIN NOW Scarce a twig moved with his motion, END
BEGIN NOW Scarce a leaf was stirred or rustled, END
BEGIN NOW But the wary roebuck started, END
BEGIN NOW Stamped with all his hoofs together, END
BEGIN NOW Listened with one foot uplifted, END
BEGIN NOW Leaped as if to meet the arrow; END
BEGIN NOW Ah! the singing, fatal arrow, END
BEGIN NOW Like a wasp it buzzed and stung him! END
BEGIN NOW Dead he lay there in the forest, END
BEGIN NOW By the ford across the river; END
BEGIN NOW Beat his timid heart no longer, END
BEGIN NOW But the heart of Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Throbbed and shouted and exulted, END
BEGIN NOW As he bore the red deer homeward, END
BEGIN NOW Hailed his coming with applauses. END
BEGIN NOW From the red deer's hide Nokomis END
BEGIN NOW Made a cloak for Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW From the red deer's flesh Nokomis END
BEGIN NOW Made a banquet to his honor. END
BEGIN NOW All the village came and feasted, END
BEGIN NOW All the guests praised Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Called him Strong-Heart, Soan-ge-taha! END
BEGIN NOW Called him Loon-Heart, Mahn-go-taysee! END
BEGIN NOW Out of childhood into manhood END
BEGIN NOW Now had grown my Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Skilled in all the craft of hunters, END
BEGIN NOW Learned in all the lore of old men, END
BEGIN NOW In all youthful sports and pastimes, END
BEGIN NOW In all manly arts and labors. END
BEGIN NOW Swift of foot was Hiawatha; END
BEGIN NOW He could shoot an arrow from him, END
BEGIN NOW And run forward with such fleetness, END
BEGIN NOW That the arrow fell behind him! END
BEGIN NOW He could shoot ten arrows upward, END
BEGIN NOW Shoot them with such strength and swiftness, END
BEGIN NOW That the tenth had left the bow-string END
BEGIN NOW Ere the first to earth had fallen! END
BEGIN NOW He had mittens, Minjekahwun, END
BEGIN NOW Magic mittens made of deer-skin; END
BEGIN NOW When upon his hands he wore them, END
BEGIN NOW He could smite the rocks asunder, END
BEGIN NOW He could grind them into powder. END
BEGIN NOW He had moccasins enchanted, END
BEGIN NOW Magic moccasins of deer-skin; END
BEGIN NOW When he bound them round his ankles, END
BEGIN NOW When upon his feet he tied them, END
BEGIN NOW At each stride a mile he measured! END
BEGIN NOW Much he questioned old Nokomis END
BEGIN NOW Of his father Mudjekeewis; END
BEGIN NOW Learned from her the fatal secret END
BEGIN NOW Of the beauty of his mother, END
BEGIN NOW Of the falsehood of his father; END
BEGIN NOW And his heart was hot within him, END
BEGIN NOW Like a living coal his heart was. END
BEGIN NOW Then he said to old Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW I will go to Mudjekeewis, END
BEGIN NOW See how fares it with my father, END
BEGIN NOW At the doorways of the West-Wind, END
BEGIN NOW At the portals of the Sunset! END
BEGIN NOW From his lodge went Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Dressed for travel, armed for hunting; END
BEGIN NOW Dressed in deer-skin shirt and leggings, END
BEGIN NOW Richly wrought with quills and wampum; END
BEGIN NOW On his head his eagle-feathers, END
BEGIN NOW Round his waist his belt of wampum, END
BEGIN NOW In his hand his bow of ash-wood, END
BEGIN NOW Strung with sinews of the reindeer; END
BEGIN NOW In his quiver oaken arrows, END
BEGIN NOW Tipped with jasper, winged with feathers; END
BEGIN NOW With his mittens, Minjekahwun, END
BEGIN NOW With his moccasins enchanted. END
BEGIN NOW Warning said the old Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW Go not forth, O Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW To the kingdom of the West-Wind, END
BEGIN NOW To the realms of Mudjekeewis, END
BEGIN NOW Lest he harm you with his magic, END
BEGIN NOW Lest he kill you with his cunning! END
BEGIN NOW But the fearless Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Heeded not her woman's warning; END
BEGIN NOW Forth he strode into the forest, END
BEGIN NOW At each stride a mile he measured; END
BEGIN NOW Lurid seemed the sky above him, END
BEGIN NOW Lurid seemed the earth beneath him, END
BEGIN NOW Hot and close the air around him, END
BEGIN NOW Filled with smoke and fiery vapors, END
BEGIN NOW As of burning woods and prairies, END
BEGIN NOW For his heart was hot within him, END
BEGIN NOW Like a living coal his heart was. END
BEGIN NOW So he journeyed westward, westward, END
BEGIN NOW Left the fleetest deer behind him, END
BEGIN NOW Left the antelope and bison; END
BEGIN NOW Crossed the rushing Esconaba, END
BEGIN NOW Crossed the mighty Mississippi, END
BEGIN NOW Passed the land of Crows and Foxes, END
BEGIN NOW Passed the dwellings of the Blackfeet, END
BEGIN NOW Came unto the Rocky Mountains, END
BEGIN NOW To the kingdom of the West-Wind, END
BEGIN NOW Where upon the gusty summits END
BEGIN NOW Sat the ancient Mudjekeewis, END
BEGIN NOW Ruler of the winds of heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Filled with awe was Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW At the aspect of his father. END
BEGIN NOW On the air about him wildly END
BEGIN NOW Tossed and streamed his cloudy tresses, END
BEGIN NOW Gleamed like drifting snow his tresses, END
BEGIN NOW Glared like Ishkoodah, the comet, END
BEGIN NOW Like the star with fiery tresses. END
BEGIN NOW Filled with joy was Mudjekeewis END
BEGIN NOW When he looked on Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Saw his youth rise up before him END
BEGIN NOW In the face of Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the beauty of Wenonah END
BEGIN NOW From the grave rise up before him. END
BEGIN NOW Welcome! said he, Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW To the kingdom of the West-Wind END
BEGIN NOW Long have I been waiting for you END
BEGIN NOW Youth is lovely, age is lonely, END
BEGIN NOW Youth is fiery, age is frosty; END
BEGIN NOW You bring back the days departed, END
BEGIN NOW You bring back my youth of passion, END
BEGIN NOW And the beautiful Wenonah! END
BEGIN NOW Many days they talked together, END
BEGIN NOW Questioned, listened, waited, answered; END
BEGIN NOW Much the mighty Mudjekeewis END
BEGIN NOW Boasted of his ancient prowess, END
BEGIN NOW Of his perilous adventures, END
BEGIN NOW His indomitable courage, END
BEGIN NOW His invulnerable body. END
BEGIN NOW Listening to his father's boasting; END
BEGIN NOW With a smile he sat and listened, END
BEGIN NOW Uttered neither threat nor menace, END
BEGIN NOW Neither word nor look betrayed him, END
BEGIN NOW But his heart was hot within him, END
BEGIN NOW Like a living coal his heart was. END
BEGIN NOW Then he said, "O Mudjekeewis, END
BEGIN NOW Is there nothing that can harm you? END
BEGIN NOW Nothing that you are afraid of? END
BEGIN NOW And the mighty Mudjekeewis, END
BEGIN NOW Grand and gracious in his boasting, END
BEGIN NOW Answered, saying, "There is nothing, END
BEGIN NOW Nothing but the black rock yonder, END
BEGIN NOW Nothing but the fatal Wawbeek! END
BEGIN NOW And he looked at Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW With a wise look and benignant, END
BEGIN NOW With a countenance paternal, END
BEGIN NOW Looked with pride upon the beauty END
BEGIN NOW Of his tall and graceful figure, END
BEGIN NOW Is there anything can harm you? END
BEGIN NOW Anything you are afraid of? END
BEGIN NOW But the wary Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Paused awhile, as if uncertain, END
BEGIN NOW Held his peace, as if resolving, END
BEGIN NOW And then answered, "There is nothing, END
BEGIN NOW Nothing but the bulrush yonder, END
BEGIN NOW Nothing but the great Apukwa! END
BEGIN NOW And as Mudjekeewis, rising, END
BEGIN NOW Stretched his hand to pluck the bulrush, END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha cried in terror, END
BEGIN NOW Cried in well-dissembled terror, END
BEGIN NOW Kago! kago! do not touch it! END
BEGIN NOW Ah, kaween!" said Mudjekeewis, END
BEGIN NOW No indeed, I will not touch it! END
BEGIN NOW Then they talked of other matters; END
BEGIN NOW First of Hiawatha's brothers, END
BEGIN NOW Then of Hiawatha's mother, END
BEGIN NOW Of the beautiful Wenonah, END
BEGIN NOW Of her birth upon the meadow, END
BEGIN NOW Of her death, as old Nokomis END
BEGIN NOW Had remembered and related. END
BEGIN NOW And he cried, "O Mudjekeewis, END
BEGIN NOW It was you who killed Wenonah, END
BEGIN NOW Took her young life and her beauty, END
BEGIN NOW Trampled it beneath your footsteps; END
BEGIN NOW You confess it! you confess it! END
BEGIN NOW And the mighty Mudjekeewis END
BEGIN NOW Tossed upon the wind his tresses, END
BEGIN NOW Bowed his hoary head in anguish, END
BEGIN NOW With a silent nod assented. END
BEGIN NOW Then up started Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW And with threatening look and gesture END
BEGIN NOW Laid his hand upon the black rock, END
BEGIN NOW On the fatal Wawbeek laid it, END
BEGIN NOW With his mittens, Minjekahwun, END
BEGIN NOW Rent the jutting crag asunder, END
BEGIN NOW Smote and crushed it into fragments, END
BEGIN NOW Hurled them madly at his father, END
BEGIN NOW The remorseful Mudjekeewis, END
BEGIN NOW For his heart was hot within him, END
BEGIN NOW Like a living coal his heart was. END
BEGIN NOW But the ruler of the West-Wind END
BEGIN NOW Blew the fragments backward from him, END
BEGIN NOW With the breathing of his nostrils, END
BEGIN NOW With the tempest of his anger, END
BEGIN NOW Blew them back at his assailant; END
BEGIN NOW Seized the bulrush, the Apukwa, END
BEGIN NOW Dragged it with its roots and fibres END
BEGIN NOW From the margin of the meadow, END
BEGIN NOW From its ooze the giant bulrush; END
BEGIN NOW Long and loud laughed Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW Then began the deadly conflict, END
BEGIN NOW Hand to hand among the mountains; END
BEGIN NOW From his eyry screamed the eagle, END
BEGIN NOW The Keneu, the great war-eagle, END
BEGIN NOW Sat upon the crags around them, END
BEGIN NOW Wheeling flapped his wings above them. END
BEGIN NOW Like a tall tree in the tempest END
BEGIN NOW Bent and lashed the giant bulrush; END
BEGIN NOW And in masses huge and heavy END
BEGIN NOW Crashing fell the fatal Wawbeek; END
BEGIN NOW Till the earth shook with the tumult END
BEGIN NOW And confusion of the battle, END
BEGIN NOW And the air was full of shoutings, END
BEGIN NOW And the thunder of the mountains, END
BEGIN NOW Starting, answered, Baim-wawa! END
BEGIN NOW Back retreated Mudjekeewis, END
BEGIN NOW Rushing westward o'er the mountains, END
BEGIN NOW Stumbling westward down the mountains, END
BEGIN NOW Three whole days retreated fighting, END
BEGIN NOW Still pursued by Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW To the doorways of the West-Wind, END
BEGIN NOW To the portals of the Sunset, END
BEGIN NOW To the earth's remotest border, END
BEGIN NOW Where into the empty spaces END
BEGIN NOW Sinks the sun, as a flamingo END
BEGIN NOW Drops into her nest at nightfall END
BEGIN NOW In the melancholy marshes. END
BEGIN NOW Hold! at length cried Mudjekeewis, END
BEGIN NOW Hold, my son, my Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW 'T is impossible to kill me, END
BEGIN NOW For you cannot kill the immortal END
BEGIN NOW I have put you to this trial, END
BEGIN NOW But to know and prove your courage; END
BEGIN NOW Now receive the prize of valor! END
BEGIN NOW Go back to your home and people, END
BEGIN NOW Live among them, toil among them, END
BEGIN NOW Cleanse the earth from all that harms it, END
BEGIN NOW Clear the fishing-grounds and rivers, END
BEGIN NOW Slay all monsters and magicians, END
BEGIN NOW All the Wendigoes, the giants, END
BEGIN NOW All the serpents, the Kenabeeks, END
BEGIN NOW As I slew the Mishe-Mokwa, END
BEGIN NOW Slew the Great Bear of the mountains. END
BEGIN NOW And at last when Death draws near you, END
BEGIN NOW When the awful eyes of Pauguk END
BEGIN NOW Glare upon you in the darkness, END
BEGIN NOW I will share my kingdom with you, END
BEGIN NOW Ruler shall you be thenceforward END
BEGIN NOW Of the home-wind, the Keewaydin. END
BEGIN NOW Thus was fought that famous battle END
BEGIN NOW In the dreadful days of Shah-shah, END
BEGIN NOW In the days long since departed, END
BEGIN NOW In the kingdom of the West-Wind. END
BEGIN NOW Still the hunter sees its traces END
BEGIN NOW Scattered far o'er hill and valley; END
BEGIN NOW Sees the giant bulrush growing END
BEGIN NOW By the ponds and water-courses, END
BEGIN NOW Sees the masses of the Wawbeek END
BEGIN NOW Lying still in every valley. END
BEGIN NOW Homeward now went Hiawatha; END
BEGIN NOW Pleasant was the landscape round him, END
BEGIN NOW Pleasant was the air above him, END
BEGIN NOW For the bitterness of anger END
BEGIN NOW Had departed wholly from him, END
BEGIN NOW From his brain the thought of vengeance, END
BEGIN NOW From his heart the burning fever. END
BEGIN NOW Only once his pace he slackened, END
BEGIN NOW Only once he paused or halted, END
BEGIN NOW Paused to purchase heads of arrows END
BEGIN NOW Of the ancient Arrow-maker, END
BEGIN NOW In the land of the Dacotahs, END
BEGIN NOW Flash and gleam among the oak-trees, END
BEGIN NOW Laugh and leap into the valley. END
BEGIN NOW There the ancient Arrow-maker END
BEGIN NOW Made his arrow-heads of sandstone, END
BEGIN NOW Arrow-heads of chalcedony, END
BEGIN NOW Arrow-heads of flint and jasper, END
BEGIN NOW Smoothed and sharpened at the edges, END
BEGIN NOW Hard and polished, keen and costly. END
BEGIN NOW With him dwelt his dark-eyed daughter, END
BEGIN NOW With her moods of shade and sunshine, END
BEGIN NOW Eyes that smiled and frowned alternate, END
BEGIN NOW Feet as rapid as the river, END
BEGIN NOW Tresses flowing like the water, END
BEGIN NOW And as musical a laughter: END
BEGIN NOW And he named her from the river, END
BEGIN NOW From the water-fall he named her, END
BEGIN NOW Was it then for heads of arrows, END
BEGIN NOW Arrow-heads of chalcedony, END
BEGIN NOW Arrow-heads of flint and jasper, END
BEGIN NOW That my Hiawatha halted END
BEGIN NOW In the land of the Dacotahs? END
BEGIN NOW Was it not to see the maiden, END
BEGIN NOW See the face of Laughing Water END
BEGIN NOW Peeping from behind the curtain, END
BEGIN NOW Hear the rustling of her garments END
BEGIN NOW From behind the waving curtain, END
BEGIN NOW As one sees the Minnehaha END
BEGIN NOW Gleaming, glancing through the branches, END
BEGIN NOW As one hears the Laughing Water END
BEGIN NOW From behind its screen of branches? END
BEGIN NOW Who shall say what thoughts and visions END
BEGIN NOW Fill the fiery brains of young men? END
BEGIN NOW Who shall say what dreams of beauty END
BEGIN NOW Filled the heart of Hiawatha? END
BEGIN NOW All he told to old Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW When he reached the lodge at sunset, END
BEGIN NOW Was the meeting with his father, END
BEGIN NOW Was his fight with Mudjekeewis; END
BEGIN NOW Not a word he said of arrows, END
BEGIN NOW Not a word of Laughing Water. END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha's Fasting END
BEGIN NOW You shall hear how Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Prayed and fasted in the forest, END
BEGIN NOW Not for greater skill in hunting, END
BEGIN NOW Not for greater craft in fishing, END
BEGIN NOW Not for triumphs in the battle, END
BEGIN NOW And renown among the warriors, END
BEGIN NOW But for profit of the people, END
BEGIN NOW For advantage of the nations. END
BEGIN NOW First he built a lodge for fasting, END
BEGIN NOW Built a wigwam in the forest, END
BEGIN NOW By the shining Big-Sea-Water, END
BEGIN NOW In the blithe and pleasant Spring-time, END
BEGIN NOW In the Moon of Leaves he built it, END
BEGIN NOW And, with dreams and visions many, END
BEGIN NOW Seven whole days and nights he fasted. END
BEGIN NOW On the first day of his fasting END
BEGIN NOW Through the leafy woods he wandered; END
BEGIN NOW Saw the deer start from the thicket, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the rabbit in his burrow, END
BEGIN NOW Heard the pheasant, Bena, drumming, END
BEGIN NOW Heard the squirrel, Adjidaumo, END
BEGIN NOW Rattling in his hoard of acorns, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the pigeon, the Omeme, END
BEGIN NOW Building nests among the pinetrees, END
BEGIN NOW And in flocks the wild-goose, Wawa, END
BEGIN NOW Flying to the fen-lands northward, END
BEGIN NOW Whirring, wailing far above him. END
BEGIN NOW Master of Life!" he cried, desponding, END
BEGIN NOW Must our lives depend on these things? END
BEGIN NOW On the next day of his fasting END
BEGIN NOW By the river's brink he wandered, END
BEGIN NOW Through the Muskoday, the meadow, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the wild rice, Mahnomonee, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the blueberry, Meenahga, END
BEGIN NOW And the strawberry, Odahmin, END
BEGIN NOW And the gooseberry, Shahbomin, END
BEGIN NOW And the grape-vine, the Bemahgut, END
BEGIN NOW Trailing o'er the alder-branches, END
BEGIN NOW Filling all the air with fragrance! END
BEGIN NOW Master of Life!" he cried, desponding, END
BEGIN NOW Must our lives depend on these things? END
BEGIN NOW On the third day of his fasting END
BEGIN NOW By the lake he sat and pondered, END
BEGIN NOW By the still, transparent water; END
BEGIN NOW Saw the sturgeon, Nahma, leaping, END
BEGIN NOW Scattering drops like beads of wampum, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the yellow perch, the Sahwa, END
BEGIN NOW Like a sunbeam in the water, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the pike, the Maskenozha, END
BEGIN NOW And the herring, Okahahwis, END
BEGIN NOW And the Shawgashee, the crawfish! END
BEGIN NOW Master of Life!" he cried, desponding, END
BEGIN NOW Must our lives depend on these things? END
BEGIN NOW On the fourth day of his fasting END
BEGIN NOW In his lodge he lay exhausted; END
BEGIN NOW From his couch of leaves and branches END
BEGIN NOW Gazing with half-open eyelids, END
BEGIN NOW Full of shadowy dreams and visions, END
BEGIN NOW On the dizzy, swimming landscape, END
BEGIN NOW On the gleaming of the water, END
BEGIN NOW On the splendor of the sunset. END
BEGIN NOW And he saw a youth approaching, END
BEGIN NOW Dressed in garments green and yellow, END
BEGIN NOW Coming through the purple twilight, END
BEGIN NOW Through the splendor of the sunset; END
BEGIN NOW Plumes of green bent o'er his forehead, END
BEGIN NOW And his hair was soft and golden. END
BEGIN NOW Standing at the open doorway, END
BEGIN NOW Long he looked at Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Looked with pity and compassion END
BEGIN NOW On his wasted form and features, END
BEGIN NOW And, in accents like the sighing END
BEGIN NOW Of the South-Wind in the tree-tops, END
BEGIN NOW All your prayers are heard in heaven, END
BEGIN NOW For you pray not like the others; END
BEGIN NOW Not for greater skill in hunting, END
BEGIN NOW Not for greater craft in fishing, END
BEGIN NOW Not for triumph in the battle, END
BEGIN NOW Nor renown among the warriors, END
BEGIN NOW But for profit of the people, END
BEGIN NOW For advantage of the nations. END
BEGIN NOW From the Master of Life descending, END
BEGIN NOW I, the friend of man, Mondamin, END
BEGIN NOW Come to warn you and instruct you, END
BEGIN NOW How by struggle and by labor END
BEGIN NOW You shall gain what you have prayed for. END
BEGIN NOW Rise up from your bed of branches, END
BEGIN NOW Rise, O youth, and wrestle with me! END
BEGIN NOW Faint with famine, Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Started from his bed of branches, END
BEGIN NOW From the twilight of his wigwam END
BEGIN NOW Forth into the flush of sunset END
BEGIN NOW Came, and wrestled with Mondamin; END
BEGIN NOW At his touch he felt new courage END
BEGIN NOW Throbbing in his brain and bosom, END
BEGIN NOW Felt new life and hope and vigor END
BEGIN NOW Run through every nerve and fibre. END
BEGIN NOW So they wrestled there together END
BEGIN NOW In the glory of the sunset, END
BEGIN NOW And the more they strove and struggled, END
BEGIN NOW Stronger still grew Hiawatha; END
BEGIN NOW Till the darkness fell around them, END
BEGIN NOW And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah, END
BEGIN NOW From her nest among the pine-trees, END
BEGIN NOW Gave a cry of lamentation, END
BEGIN NOW Gave a scream of pain and famine. END
BEGIN NOW 'T is enough!" then said Mondamin, END
BEGIN NOW Smiling upon Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW But tomorrow, when the sun sets, END
BEGIN NOW I will come again to try you. END
BEGIN NOW And he vanished, and was seen not; END
BEGIN NOW Whether sinking as the rain sinks, END
BEGIN NOW Whether rising as the mists rise, END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha saw not, knew not, END
BEGIN NOW Only saw that he had vanished, END
BEGIN NOW Leaving him alone and fainting, END
BEGIN NOW With the misty lake below him, END
BEGIN NOW And the reeling stars above him. END
BEGIN NOW On the morrow and the next day, END
BEGIN NOW When the sun through heaven descending, END
BEGIN NOW Like a red and burning cinder END
BEGIN NOW From the hearth of the Great Spirit, END
BEGIN NOW Fell into the western waters, END
BEGIN NOW Came Mondamin for the trial, END
BEGIN NOW For the strife with Hiawatha; END
BEGIN NOW Came as silent as the dew comes, END
BEGIN NOW From the empty air appearing, END
BEGIN NOW Into empty air returning, END
BEGIN NOW Taking shape when earth it touches, END
BEGIN NOW But invisible to all men END
BEGIN NOW In its coming and its going. END
BEGIN NOW Thrice they wrestled there together END
BEGIN NOW In the glory of the sunset, END
BEGIN NOW Till the darkness fell around them, END
BEGIN NOW Till the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah, END
BEGIN NOW From her nest among the pine-trees, END
BEGIN NOW Uttered her loud cry of famine, END
BEGIN NOW And Mondamin paused to listen. END
BEGIN NOW Tall and beautiful he stood there, END
BEGIN NOW In his garments green and yellow; END
BEGIN NOW To and fro his plumes above him, END
BEGIN NOW Waved and nodded with his breathing, END
BEGIN NOW And the sweat of the encounter END
BEGIN NOW Stood like drops of dew upon him. END
BEGIN NOW And he cried, "O Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW Bravely have you wrestled with me, END
BEGIN NOW Thrice have wrestled stoutly with me, END
BEGIN NOW And the Master of Life, who sees us, END
BEGIN NOW He will give to you the triumph! END
BEGIN NOW Then he smiled, and said: To-morrow END
BEGIN NOW Is the last day of your conflict, END
BEGIN NOW Is the last day of your fasting. END
BEGIN NOW You will conquer and o'ercome me; END
BEGIN NOW Where the rain may fall upon me, END
BEGIN NOW Where the sun may come and warm me; END
BEGIN NOW Strip these garments, green and yellow, END
BEGIN NOW Strip this nodding plumage from me, END
BEGIN NOW Lay me in the earth, and make it END
BEGIN NOW Soft and loose and light above me. END
BEGIN NOW Let no hand disturb my slumber, END
BEGIN NOW Let no weed nor worm molest me, END
BEGIN NOW Let not Kahgahgee, the raven, END
BEGIN NOW Come to haunt me and molest me, END
BEGIN NOW Only come yourself to watch me, END
BEGIN NOW Till I wake, and start, and quicken, END
BEGIN NOW Till I leap into the sunshine END
BEGIN NOW And thus saying, he departed; END
BEGIN NOW Peacefully slept Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW But he heard the Wawonaissa, END
BEGIN NOW Heard the whippoorwill complaining, END
BEGIN NOW Perched upon his lonely wigwam; END
BEGIN NOW Heard the rushing Sebowisha, END
BEGIN NOW Heard the rivulet rippling near him, END
BEGIN NOW Talking to the darksome forest; END
BEGIN NOW Heard the sighing of the branches, END
BEGIN NOW As they lifted and subsided END
BEGIN NOW At the passing of the night-wind, END
BEGIN NOW Heard them, as one hears in slumber END
BEGIN NOW Far-off murmurs, dreamy whispers: END
BEGIN NOW Peacefully slept Hiawatha. END
BEGIN NOW On the morrow came Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW On the seventh day of his fasting, END
BEGIN NOW Came with food for Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Came imploring and bewailing, END
BEGIN NOW Lest his hunger should o'ercome him, END
BEGIN NOW Lest his fasting should be fatal. END
BEGIN NOW But he tasted not, and touched not, END
BEGIN NOW Only said to her, Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW Wait until the sun is setting, END
BEGIN NOW Till the darkness falls around us, END
BEGIN NOW Till the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah, END
BEGIN NOW Crying from the desolate marshes, END
BEGIN NOW Tells us that the day is ended. END
BEGIN NOW Homeward weeping went Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW Fearing lest his strength should fail him, END
BEGIN NOW Lest his fasting should be fatal. END
BEGIN NOW He meanwhile sat weary waiting END
BEGIN NOW For the coming of Mondamin, END
BEGIN NOW Till the shadows, pointing eastward, END
BEGIN NOW Lengthened over field and forest, END
BEGIN NOW Till the sun dropped from the heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Floating on the waters westward, END
BEGIN NOW As a red leaf in the Autumn END
BEGIN NOW Falls and floats upon the water, END
BEGIN NOW Falls and sinks into its bosom. END
BEGIN NOW And behold! the young Mondamin, END
BEGIN NOW With his soft and shining tresses, END
BEGIN NOW With his garments green and yellow, END
BEGIN NOW With his long and glossy plumage, END
BEGIN NOW Stood and beckoned at the doorway. END
BEGIN NOW And as one in slumber walking, END
BEGIN NOW Pale and haggard, but undaunted, END
BEGIN NOW From the wigwam Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Came and wrestled with Mondamin. END
BEGIN NOW Round about him spun the landscape, END
BEGIN NOW Sky and forest reeled together, END
BEGIN NOW And his strong heart leaped within him, END
BEGIN NOW As the sturgeon leaps and struggles END
BEGIN NOW In a net to break its meshes. END
BEGIN NOW Like a ring of fire around him END
BEGIN NOW Blazed and flared the red horizon, END
BEGIN NOW And a hundred suns seemed looking END
BEGIN NOW At the combat of the wrestlers. END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly upon the greensward END
BEGIN NOW All alone stood Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Panting with his wild exertion, END
BEGIN NOW Palpitating with the struggle; END
BEGIN NOW And before him breathless, lifeless, END
BEGIN NOW Lay the youth, with hair dishevelled, END
BEGIN NOW Plumage torn, and garments tattered, END
BEGIN NOW Dead he lay there in the sunset. END
BEGIN NOW And victorious Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Made the grave as he commanded, END
BEGIN NOW Stripped the garments from Mondamin, END
BEGIN NOW Stripped his tattered plumage from him, END
BEGIN NOW Laid him in the earth, and made it END
BEGIN NOW Soft and loose and light above him; END
BEGIN NOW And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah, END
BEGIN NOW From the melancholy moorlands, END
BEGIN NOW Gave a cry of lamentation, END
BEGIN NOW Gave a cry of pain and anguish! END
BEGIN NOW Homeward then went Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW To the lodge of old Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW And the seven days of his fasting END
BEGIN NOW Were accomplished and completed. END
BEGIN NOW But the place was not forgotten END
BEGIN NOW Where he wrestled with Mondamin; END
BEGIN NOW Nor forgotten nor neglected END
BEGIN NOW Was the grave where lay Mondamin, END
BEGIN NOW Sleeping in the rain and sunshine, END
BEGIN NOW Where his scattered plumes and garments END
BEGIN NOW Faded in the rain and sunshine. END
BEGIN NOW Go to wait and watch beside it; END
BEGIN NOW Kept the dark mould soft above it, END
BEGIN NOW Kept it clean from weeds and insects, END
BEGIN NOW Drove away, with scoffs and shoutings, END
BEGIN NOW Kahgahgee, the king of ravens. END
BEGIN NOW Till at length a small green feather END
BEGIN NOW From the earth shot slowly upward, END
BEGIN NOW Then another and another, END
BEGIN NOW And before the Summer ended END
BEGIN NOW Stood the maize in all its beauty, END
BEGIN NOW With its shining robes about it, END
BEGIN NOW And its long, soft, yellow tresses; END
BEGIN NOW And in rapture Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Cried aloud, "It is Mondamin! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, the friend of man, Mondamin! END
BEGIN NOW Then he called to old Nokomis END
BEGIN NOW And Iagoo, the great boaster, END
BEGIN NOW Showed them where the maize was growing, END
BEGIN NOW Told them of his wondrous vision, END
BEGIN NOW Of his wrestling and his triumph, END
BEGIN NOW Of this new gift to the nations, END
BEGIN NOW Which should be their food forever. END
BEGIN NOW And still later, when the Autumn END
BEGIN NOW Changed the long, green leaves to yellow, END
BEGIN NOW And the soft and juicy kernels END
BEGIN NOW Grew like wampum hard and yellow, END
BEGIN NOW Then the ripened ears he gathered, END
BEGIN NOW Stripped the withered husks from off them, END
BEGIN NOW As he once had stripped the wrestler, END
BEGIN NOW Gave the first Feast of Mondamin, END
BEGIN NOW And made known unto the people END
BEGIN NOW This new gift of the Great Spirit. END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha's Friends END
BEGIN NOW Two good friends had Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Singled out from all the others, END
BEGIN NOW Bound to him in closest union, END
BEGIN NOW And to whom he gave the right hand END
BEGIN NOW Of his heart, in joy and sorrow; END
BEGIN NOW Chibiabos, the musician, END
BEGIN NOW And the very strong man, Kwasind. END
BEGIN NOW Straight between them ran the pathway, END
BEGIN NOW Never grew the grass upon it; END
BEGIN NOW Singing birds, that utter falsehoods, END
BEGIN NOW Story-tellers, mischief-makers, END
BEGIN NOW Found no eager ear to listen, END
BEGIN NOW Could not breed ill-will between them, END
BEGIN NOW For they kept each other's counsel, END
BEGIN NOW Spake with naked hearts together, END
BEGIN NOW Pondering much and much contriving END
BEGIN NOW How the tribes of men might prosper. END
BEGIN NOW Most beloved by Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Was the gentle Chibiabos, END
BEGIN NOW He the best of all musicians, END
BEGIN NOW He the sweetest of all singers. END
BEGIN NOW Beautiful and childlike was he, END
BEGIN NOW Brave as man is, soft as woman, END
BEGIN NOW Pliant as a wand of willow, END
BEGIN NOW Stately as a deer with antlers. END
BEGIN NOW When he sang, the village listened; END
BEGIN NOW All the warriors gathered round him, END
BEGIN NOW All the women came to hear him; END
BEGIN NOW Now he stirred their souls to passion, END
BEGIN NOW Now he melted them to pity. END
BEGIN NOW From the hollow reeds he fashioned END
BEGIN NOW Flutes so musical and mellow, END
BEGIN NOW That the brook, the Sebowisha, END
BEGIN NOW Ceased to murmur in the woodland, END
BEGIN NOW That the wood-birds ceased from singing, END
BEGIN NOW And the squirrel, Adjidaumo, END
BEGIN NOW Ceased his chatter in the oak-tree, END
BEGIN NOW And the rabbit, the Wabasso, END
BEGIN NOW Sat upright to look and listen. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, the brook, the Sebowisha, END
BEGIN NOW Pausing, said, "O Chibiabos, END
BEGIN NOW Teach my waves to flow in music, END
BEGIN NOW Softly as your words in singing! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, the bluebird, the Owaissa, END
BEGIN NOW Envious, said, "O Chibiabos, END
BEGIN NOW Teach me tones as wild and wayward, END
BEGIN NOW Teach me songs as full of frenzy! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, the robin, the Opechee, END
BEGIN NOW Joyous, said, "O Chibiabos, END
BEGIN NOW Teach me tones as sweet and tender, END
BEGIN NOW Teach me songs as full of gladness! END
BEGIN NOW And the whippoorwill, Wawonaissa, END
BEGIN NOW Sobbing, said, "O Chibiabos, END
BEGIN NOW Teach me tones as melancholy, END
BEGIN NOW Teach me songs as full of sadness! END
BEGIN NOW All the many sounds of nature END
BEGIN NOW Borrowed sweetness from his singing; END
BEGIN NOW All the hearts of men were softened END
BEGIN NOW By the pathos of his music; END
BEGIN NOW For he sang of peace and freedom, END
BEGIN NOW Sang of beauty, love, and longing; END
BEGIN NOW Sang of death, and life undying END
BEGIN NOW In the kingdom of Ponemah, END
BEGIN NOW In the land of the Hereafter. END
BEGIN NOW Very dear to Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Was the gentle Chibiabos, END
BEGIN NOW He the best of all musicians, END
BEGIN NOW He the sweetest of all singers; END
BEGIN NOW For his gentleness he loved him, END
BEGIN NOW And the magic of his singing. END
BEGIN NOW Dear, too, unto Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Was the very strong man, Kwasind, END
BEGIN NOW He the strongest of all mortals, END
BEGIN NOW He the mightiest among many; END
BEGIN NOW For his very strength he loved him, END
BEGIN NOW For his strength allied to goodness. END
BEGIN NOW Idle in his youth was Kwasind, END
BEGIN NOW Very listless, dull, and dreamy, END
BEGIN NOW Never played with other children, END
BEGIN NOW Never fished and never hunted, END
BEGIN NOW Not like other children was he; END
BEGIN NOW But they saw that much he fasted, END
BEGIN NOW Much his Manito entreated, END
BEGIN NOW Much besought his Guardian Spirit. END
BEGIN NOW Lazy Kwasind!" said his mother, END
BEGIN NOW In my work you never help me! END
BEGIN NOW In the Summer you are roaming END
BEGIN NOW Idly in the fields and forests; END
BEGIN NOW In the Winter you are cowering END
BEGIN NOW O'er the firebrands in the wigwam! END
BEGIN NOW In the coldest days of Winter END
BEGIN NOW I must break the ice for fishing; END
BEGIN NOW With my nets you never help me! END
BEGIN NOW At the door my nets are hanging, END
BEGIN NOW Dripping, freezing with the water; END
BEGIN NOW Go and wring them, Yenadizze! END
BEGIN NOW Go and dry them in the sunshine! END
BEGIN NOW Slowly, from the ashes, Kwasind END
BEGIN NOW Rose, but made no angry answer; END
BEGIN NOW From the lodge went forth in silence, END
BEGIN NOW Took the nets, that hung together, END
BEGIN NOW Dripping, freezing at the doorway; END
BEGIN NOW Like a wisp of straw he wrung them, END
BEGIN NOW Like a wisp of straw he broke them, END
BEGIN NOW Could not wring them without breaking, END
BEGIN NOW Such the strength was in his fingers. END
BEGIN NOW Lazy Kwasind!" said his father, END
BEGIN NOW In the hunt you never help me; END
BEGIN NOW Every bow you touch is broken, END
BEGIN NOW Snapped asunder every arrow; END
BEGIN NOW Yet come with me to the forest, END
BEGIN NOW You shall bring the hunting homeward. END
BEGIN NOW Down a narrow pass they wandered, END
BEGIN NOW Where a brooklet led them onward, END
BEGIN NOW Where the trail of deer and bison END
BEGIN NOW Marked the soft mud on the margin, END
BEGIN NOW Till they found all further passage END
BEGIN NOW Shut against them, barred securely END
BEGIN NOW By the trunks of trees uprooted, END
BEGIN NOW Lying lengthwise, lying crosswise, END
BEGIN NOW And forbidding further passage. END
BEGIN NOW We must go back," said the old man, END
BEGIN NOW O'er these logs we cannot clamber; END
BEGIN NOW Not a woodchuck could get through them, END
BEGIN NOW Not a squirrel clamber o'er them! END
BEGIN NOW And straightway his pipe he lighted, END
BEGIN NOW And sat down to smoke and ponder. END
BEGIN NOW But before his pipe was finished, END
BEGIN NOW Lo! the path was cleared before him; END
BEGIN NOW All the trunks had Kwasind lifted, END
BEGIN NOW To the right hand, to the left hand, END
BEGIN NOW Shot the pine-trees swift as arrows, END
BEGIN NOW Hurled the cedars light as lances. END
BEGIN NOW Lazy Kwasind!" said the young men, END
BEGIN NOW As they sported in the meadow: END
BEGIN NOW Why stand idly looking at us, END
BEGIN NOW Leaning on the rock behind you? END
BEGIN NOW Come and wrestle with the others, END
BEGIN NOW Let us pitch the quoit together! END
BEGIN NOW Lazy Kwasind made no answer, END
BEGIN NOW To their challenge made no answer, END
BEGIN NOW Only rose, and slowly turning, END
BEGIN NOW Seized the huge rock in his fingers, END
BEGIN NOW Tore it from its deep foundation, END
BEGIN NOW Poised it in the air a moment, END
BEGIN NOW Pitched it sheer into the river, END
BEGIN NOW Sheer into the swift Pauwating, END
BEGIN NOW Where it still is seen in Summer. END
BEGIN NOW Once as down that foaming river, END
BEGIN NOW Down the rapids of Pauwating, END
BEGIN NOW Kwasind sailed with his companions, END
BEGIN NOW In the stream he saw a beaver, END
BEGIN NOW Struggling with the rushing currents, END
BEGIN NOW Rising, sinking in the water. END
BEGIN NOW Without speaking, without pausing, END
BEGIN NOW Kwasind leaped into the river, END
BEGIN NOW Plunged beneath the bubbling surface, END
BEGIN NOW Through the whirlpools chased the beaver, END
BEGIN NOW Followed him among the islands, END
BEGIN NOW Stayed so long beneath the water, END
BEGIN NOW That his terrified companions END
BEGIN NOW Cried, "Alas! good-by to Kwasind! END
BEGIN NOW We shall never more see Kwasind! END
BEGIN NOW But he reappeared triumphant, END
BEGIN NOW And upon his shining shoulders END
BEGIN NOW Brought the beaver, dead and dripping, END
BEGIN NOW And these two, as I have told you, END
BEGIN NOW Were the friends of Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Chibiabos, the musician, END
BEGIN NOW And the very strong man, Kwasind. END
BEGIN NOW Long they lived in peace together, END
BEGIN NOW Spake with naked hearts together, END
BEGIN NOW Pondering much and much contriving END
BEGIN NOW How the tribes of men might prosper. END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha's Sailing END
BEGIN NOW Give me of your bark, O Birch-tree! END
BEGIN NOW Of your yellow bark, O Birch-tree! END
BEGIN NOW Growing by the rushing river, END
BEGIN NOW Tall and stately in the valley! END
BEGIN NOW I a light canoe will build me, END
BEGIN NOW Build a swift Cheemaun for sailing, END
BEGIN NOW That shall float upon the river, END
BEGIN NOW Like a yellow leaf in Autumn, END
BEGIN NOW Like a yellow water-lily! END
BEGIN NOW Lay aside your cloak, O Birch-tree! END
BEGIN NOW Lay aside your white-skin wrapper, END
BEGIN NOW For the Summer-time is coming, END
BEGIN NOW And the sun is warm in heaven, END
BEGIN NOW And you need no white-skin wrapper! END
BEGIN NOW Thus aloud cried Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW In the solitary forest, END
BEGIN NOW By the rushing Taquamenaw, END
BEGIN NOW When the birds were singing gayly, END
BEGIN NOW In the Moon of Leaves were singing, END
BEGIN NOW And the sun, from sleep awaking, END
BEGIN NOW Started up and said, "Behold me! END
BEGIN NOW Gheezis, the great Sun, behold me! END
BEGIN NOW And the tree with all its branches END
BEGIN NOW Rustled in the breeze of morning, END
BEGIN NOW Saying, with a sigh of patience, END
BEGIN NOW Take my cloak, O Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW With his knife the tree he girdled; END
BEGIN NOW Just beneath its lowest branches, END
BEGIN NOW Just above the roots, he cut it, END
BEGIN NOW Till the sap came oozing outward; END
BEGIN NOW Down the trunk, from top to bottom, END
BEGIN NOW Sheer he cleft the bark asunder, END
BEGIN NOW With a wooden wedge he raised it, END
BEGIN NOW Stripped it from the trunk unbroken. END
BEGIN NOW Give me of your boughs, O Cedar! END
BEGIN NOW Of your strong and pliant branches, END
BEGIN NOW My canoe to make more steady, END
BEGIN NOW Make more strong and firm beneath me! END
BEGIN NOW Through the summit of the Cedar END
BEGIN NOW Went a sound, a cry of horror, END
BEGIN NOW Went a murmur of resistance; END
BEGIN NOW But it whispered, bending downward, END
BEGIN NOW Take my boughs, O Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW Down he hewed the boughs of cedar, END
BEGIN NOW Shaped them straightway to a frame-work, END
BEGIN NOW Like two bows he formed and shaped them, END
BEGIN NOW Like two bended bows together. END
BEGIN NOW Give me of your roots, O Tamarack! END
BEGIN NOW Of your fibrous roots, O Larch-tree! END
BEGIN NOW My canoe to bind together, END
BEGIN NOW So to bind the ends together END
BEGIN NOW That the water may not enter, END
BEGIN NOW That the river may not wet me! END
BEGIN NOW And the Larch, with all its fibres, END
BEGIN NOW Shivered in the air of morning, END
BEGIN NOW Touched his forehead with its tassels, END
BEGIN NOW Slid, with one long sigh of sorrow. END
BEGIN NOW Take them all, O Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW From the earth he tore the fibres, END
BEGIN NOW Tore the tough roots of the Larch-tree, END
BEGIN NOW Closely sewed the bark together, END
BEGIN NOW Bound it closely to the frame-work. END
BEGIN NOW Give me of your balm, O Fir-tree! END
BEGIN NOW Of your balsam and your resin, END
BEGIN NOW So to close the seams together END
BEGIN NOW That the water may not enter, END
BEGIN NOW That the river may not wet me! END
BEGIN NOW And the Fir-tree, tall and sombre, END
BEGIN NOW Sobbed through all its robes of darkness, END
BEGIN NOW Rattled like a shore with pebbles, END
BEGIN NOW Answered wailing, answered weeping, END
BEGIN NOW Take my balm, O Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW And he took the tears of balsam, END
BEGIN NOW Took the resin of the Fir-tree, END
BEGIN NOW Smeared therewith each seam and fissure, END
BEGIN NOW Made each crevice safe from water. END
BEGIN NOW Give me of your quills, O Hedgehog! END
BEGIN NOW All your quills, O Kagh, the Hedgehog! END
BEGIN NOW I will make a necklace of them, END
BEGIN NOW Make a girdle for my beauty, END
BEGIN NOW And two stars to deck her bosom! END
BEGIN NOW From a hollow tree the Hedgehog END
BEGIN NOW With his sleepy eyes looked at him, END
BEGIN NOW Shot his shining quills, like arrows, END
BEGIN NOW Saying with a drowsy murmur, END
BEGIN NOW Through the tangle of his whiskers, END
BEGIN NOW Take my quills, O Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW From the ground the quills he gathered, END
BEGIN NOW All the little shining arrows, END
BEGIN NOW Stained them red and blue and yellow, END
BEGIN NOW With the juice of roots and berries; END
BEGIN NOW Into his canoe he wrought them, END
BEGIN NOW Round its waist a shining girdle, END
BEGIN NOW Round its bows a gleaming necklace, END
BEGIN NOW On its breast two stars resplendent. END
BEGIN NOW Thus the Birch Canoe was builded END
BEGIN NOW In the valley, by the river, END
BEGIN NOW In the bosom of the forest; END
BEGIN NOW And the forest's life was in it, END
BEGIN NOW All its mystery and its magic, END
BEGIN NOW All the lightness of the birch-tree, END
BEGIN NOW All the toughness of the cedar, END
BEGIN NOW All the larch's supple sinews; END
BEGIN NOW And it floated on the river END
BEGIN NOW Like a yellow leaf in Autumn, END
BEGIN NOW Like a yellow water-lily. END
BEGIN NOW Paddles none had Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Paddles none he had or needed, END
BEGIN NOW For his thoughts as paddles served him, END
BEGIN NOW And his wishes served to guide him; END
BEGIN NOW Swift or slow at will he glided, END
BEGIN NOW Veered to right or left at pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW Then he called aloud to Kwasind, END
BEGIN NOW To his friend, the strong man, Kwasind, END
BEGIN NOW Saying, "Help me clear this river END
BEGIN NOW Of its sunken logs and sand-bars. END
BEGIN NOW Straight into the river Kwasind END
BEGIN NOW Plunged as if he were an otter, END
BEGIN NOW Dived as if he were a beaver, END
BEGIN NOW Stood up to his waist in water, END
BEGIN NOW To his arm-pits in the river, END
BEGIN NOW Swam and scouted in the river, END
BEGIN NOW Tugged at sunken logs and branches, END
BEGIN NOW With his hands he scooped the sand-bars, END
BEGIN NOW With his feet the ooze and tangle. END
BEGIN NOW And thus sailed my Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Down the rushing Taquamenaw, END
BEGIN NOW Sailed through all its bends and windings, END
BEGIN NOW Sailed through all its deeps and shallows, END
BEGIN NOW While his friend, the strong man, Kwasind, END
BEGIN NOW Swam the deeps, the shallows waded. END
BEGIN NOW Up and down the river went they, END
BEGIN NOW In and out among its islands, END
BEGIN NOW Cleared its bed of root and sand-bar, END
BEGIN NOW Dragged the dead trees from its channel, END
BEGIN NOW Made its passage safe and certain, END
BEGIN NOW Made a pathway for the people, END
BEGIN NOW From its springs among the mountains, END
BEGIN NOW To the waters of Pauwating, END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha's Fishing END
BEGIN NOW Forth upon the Gitche Gumee, END
BEGIN NOW On the shining Big-Sea-Water, END
BEGIN NOW With his fishing-line of cedar, END
BEGIN NOW Of the twisted bark of cedar, END
BEGIN NOW Forth to catch the sturgeon Nahma, END
BEGIN NOW In his birch canoe exulting END
BEGIN NOW All alone went Hiawatha. END
BEGIN NOW Through the clear, transparent water END
BEGIN NOW He could see the fishes swimming END
BEGIN NOW Far down in the depths below him; END
BEGIN NOW See the yellow perch, the Sahwa, END
BEGIN NOW Like a sunbeam in the water, END
BEGIN NOW See the Shawgashee, the craw-fish, END
BEGIN NOW Like a spider on the bottom, END
BEGIN NOW On the white and sandy bottom. END
BEGIN NOW At the stern sat Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW With his fishing-line of cedar; END
BEGIN NOW In his plumes the breeze of morning END
BEGIN NOW Played as in the hemlock branches; END
BEGIN NOW On the bows, with tail erected, END
BEGIN NOW Sat the squirrel, Adjidaumo; END
BEGIN NOW In his fur the breeze of morning END
BEGIN NOW Played as in the prairie grasses. END
BEGIN NOW On the white sand of the bottom END
BEGIN NOW Lay the monster Mishe-Nahma, END
BEGIN NOW Lay the sturgeon, King of Fishes; END
BEGIN NOW Through his gills he breathed the water, END
BEGIN NOW With his fins he fanned and winnowed, END
BEGIN NOW With his tail he swept the sand-floor. END
BEGIN NOW There he lay in all his armor; END
BEGIN NOW On each side a shield to guard him, END
BEGIN NOW Plates of bone upon his forehead, END
BEGIN NOW Down his sides and back and shoulders END
BEGIN NOW Plates of bone with spines projecting END
BEGIN NOW Painted was he with his war-paints, END
BEGIN NOW Stripes of yellow, red, and azure, END
BEGIN NOW Spots of brown and spots of sable; END
BEGIN NOW And he lay there on the bottom, END
BEGIN NOW Fanning with his fins of purple, END
BEGIN NOW As above him Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW In his birch canoe came sailing, END
BEGIN NOW With his fishing-line of cedar. END
BEGIN NOW Take my bait," cried Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Dawn into the depths beneath him, END
BEGIN NOW Take my bait, O Sturgeon, Nahma! END
BEGIN NOW Come up from below the water, END
BEGIN NOW Let us see which is the stronger! END
BEGIN NOW And he dropped his line of cedar END
BEGIN NOW Through the clear, transparent water, END
BEGIN NOW Waited vainly for an answer, END
BEGIN NOW Long sat waiting for an answer, END
BEGIN NOW And repeating loud and louder, END
BEGIN NOW Take my bait, O King of Fishes! END
BEGIN NOW Quiet lay the sturgeon, Nahma, END
BEGIN NOW Fanning slowly in the water, END
BEGIN NOW Listening to his call and clamor, END
BEGIN NOW His unnecessary tumult, END
BEGIN NOW Till he wearied of the shouting; END
BEGIN NOW And he said to the Kenozha, END
BEGIN NOW To the pike, the Maskenozha, END
BEGIN NOW Take the bait of this rude fellow, END
BEGIN NOW Break the line of Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW In his fingers Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Felt the loose line jerk and tighten, END
BEGIN NOW As he drew it in, it tugged so END
BEGIN NOW That the birch canoe stood endwise, END
BEGIN NOW Like a birch log in the water, END
BEGIN NOW With the squirrel, Adjidaumo, END
BEGIN NOW Perched and frisking on the summit. END
BEGIN NOW Full of scorn was Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW When he saw the fish rise upward, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the pike, the Maskenozha, END
BEGIN NOW Coming nearer, nearer to him, END
BEGIN NOW And he shouted through the water, END
BEGIN NOW Esa! esa! shame upon you! END
BEGIN NOW You are but the pike, Kenozha, END
BEGIN NOW You are not the fish I wanted, END
BEGIN NOW Reeling downward to the bottom END
BEGIN NOW Sank the pike in great confusion, END
BEGIN NOW And the mighty sturgeon, Nahma, END
BEGIN NOW Said to Ugudwash, the sun-fish, END
BEGIN NOW To the bream, with scales of crimson, END
BEGIN NOW Take the bait of this great boaster, END
BEGIN NOW Break the line of Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW Slowly upward, wavering, gleaming, END
BEGIN NOW Rose the Ugudwash, the sun-fish, END
BEGIN NOW Seized the line of Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Swung with all his weight upon it, END
BEGIN NOW Made a whirlpool in the water, END
BEGIN NOW Whirled the birch canoe in circles, END
BEGIN NOW Round and round in gurgling eddies, END
BEGIN NOW Till the circles in the water END
BEGIN NOW Reached the far-off sandy beaches, END
BEGIN NOW Till the water-flags and rushes END
BEGIN NOW Nodded on the distant margins. END
BEGIN NOW But when Hiawatha saw him END
BEGIN NOW Slowly rising through the water, END
BEGIN NOW Lifting up his disk refulgent, END
BEGIN NOW Loud he shouted in derision, END
BEGIN NOW Esa! esa! shame upon you! END
BEGIN NOW You are Ugudwash, the sun-fish, END
BEGIN NOW You are not the fish I wanted, END
BEGIN NOW Slowly downward, wavering, gleaming, END
BEGIN NOW Sank the Ugudwash, the sun-fish, END
BEGIN NOW And again the sturgeon, Nahma, END
BEGIN NOW Heard the shout of Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Heard his challenge of defiance, END
BEGIN NOW The unnecessary tumult, END
BEGIN NOW Ringing far across the water. END
BEGIN NOW From the white sand of the bottom END
BEGIN NOW Up he rose with angry gesture, END
BEGIN NOW Quivering in each nerve and fibre, END
BEGIN NOW Clashing all his plates of armor, END
BEGIN NOW Gleaming bright with all his war-paint; END
BEGIN NOW In his wrath he darted upward, END
BEGIN NOW Flashing leaped into the sunshine, END
BEGIN NOW Opened his great jaws, and swallowed END
BEGIN NOW Both canoe and Hiawatha. END
BEGIN NOW Down into that darksome cavern END
BEGIN NOW Plunged the headlong Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW As a log on some black river END
BEGIN NOW Shoots and plunges down the rapids, END
BEGIN NOW Found himself in utter darkness, END
BEGIN NOW Groped about in helpless wonder, END
BEGIN NOW Till he felt a great heart beating, END
BEGIN NOW Throbbing in that utter darkness. END
BEGIN NOW And he smote it in his anger, END
BEGIN NOW With his fist, the heart of Nahma, END
BEGIN NOW Felt the mighty King of Fishes END
BEGIN NOW Shudder through each nerve and fibre, END
BEGIN NOW Heard the water gurgle round him END
BEGIN NOW As he leaped and staggered through it, END
BEGIN NOW Sick at heart, and faint and weary. END
BEGIN NOW Crosswise then did Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Drag his birch-canoe for safety, END
BEGIN NOW Lest from out the jaws of Nahma, END
BEGIN NOW In the turmoil and confusion, END
BEGIN NOW Forth he might be hurled and perish. END
BEGIN NOW And the squirrel, Adjidaumo, END
BEGIN NOW Frisked and chatted very gayly, END
BEGIN NOW Toiled and tugged with Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Till the labor was completed. END
BEGIN NOW Then said Hiawatha to him, END
BEGIN NOW O my little friend, the squirrel, END
BEGIN NOW Bravely have you toiled to help me; END
BEGIN NOW Take the thanks of Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW And the name which now he gives you; END
BEGIN NOW For hereafter and forever END
BEGIN NOW Boys shall call you Adjidaumo, END
BEGIN NOW Tail-in-air the boys shall call you! END
BEGIN NOW And again the sturgeon, Nahma, END
BEGIN NOW Gasped and quivered in the water, END
BEGIN NOW Then was still, and drifted landward END
BEGIN NOW Till he grated on the pebbles, END
BEGIN NOW Till the listening Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Heard him grate upon the margin, END
BEGIN NOW Felt him strand upon the pebbles, END
BEGIN NOW Knew that Nahma, King of Fishes, END
BEGIN NOW Lay there dead upon the margin. END
BEGIN NOW Then he heard a clang and flapping, END
BEGIN NOW As of many wings assembling, END
BEGIN NOW Heard a screaming and confusion, END
BEGIN NOW As of birds of prey contending, END
BEGIN NOW Saw a gleam of light above him, END
BEGIN NOW Shining through the ribs of Nahma, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the glittering eyes of sea-gulls, END
BEGIN NOW Of Kayoshk, the sea-gulls, peering, END
BEGIN NOW Gazing at him through the opening, END
BEGIN NOW Heard them saying to each other, END
BEGIN NOW 'T is our brother, Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW And he shouted from below them, END
BEGIN NOW Cried exulting from the caverns: END
BEGIN NOW O ye sea-gulls! O my brothers! END
BEGIN NOW I have slain the sturgeon, Nahma; END
BEGIN NOW Make the rifts a little larger, END
BEGIN NOW With your claws the openings widen, END
BEGIN NOW Set me free from this dark prison, END
BEGIN NOW And henceforward and forever END
BEGIN NOW Men shall speak of your achievements, END
BEGIN NOW Calling you Kayoshk, the sea-gulls, END
BEGIN NOW And the wild and clamorous sea-gulls END
BEGIN NOW Toiled with beak and claws together, END
BEGIN NOW Made the rifts and openings wider END
BEGIN NOW In the mighty ribs of Nahma, END
BEGIN NOW And from peril and from prison, END
BEGIN NOW From the body of the sturgeon, END
BEGIN NOW From the peril of the water, END
BEGIN NOW They released my Hiawatha. END
BEGIN NOW He was standing near his wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW On the margin of the water, END
BEGIN NOW And he called to old Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW Called and beckoned to Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW Pointed to the sturgeon, Nahma, END
BEGIN NOW Lying lifeless on the pebbles, END
BEGIN NOW With the sea-gulls feeding on him. END
BEGIN NOW I have slain the Mishe-Nahma, END
BEGIN NOW Slain the King of Fishes!" said he; END
BEGIN NOW Look! the sea-gulls feed upon him, END
BEGIN NOW Yes, my friends Kayoshk, the sea-gulls; END
BEGIN NOW Drive them not away, Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW They have saved me from great peril END
BEGIN NOW In the body of the sturgeon, END
BEGIN NOW Wait until their meal is ended, END
BEGIN NOW Till their craws are full with feasting, END
BEGIN NOW Till they homeward fly, at sunset, END
BEGIN NOW To their nests among the marshes; END
BEGIN NOW Then bring all your pots and kettles, END
BEGIN NOW And make oil for us in Winter. END
BEGIN NOW And she waited till the sun set, END
BEGIN NOW Till the pallid moon, the Night-sun, END
BEGIN NOW Rose above the tranquil water, END
BEGIN NOW Till Kayoshk, the sated sea-gulls, END
BEGIN NOW From their banquet rose with clamor, END
BEGIN NOW And across the fiery sunset END
BEGIN NOW Winged their way to far-off islands, END
BEGIN NOW To their nests among the rushes. END
BEGIN NOW To his sleep went Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW And Nokomis to her labor, END
BEGIN NOW Toiling patient in the moonlight, END
BEGIN NOW Till the sun and moon changed places, END
BEGIN NOW Till the sky was red with sunrise, END
BEGIN NOW And Kayoshk, the hungry sea-gulls, END
BEGIN NOW Came back from the reedy islands, END
BEGIN NOW Clamorous for their morning banquet. END
BEGIN NOW Three whole days and nights alternate END
BEGIN NOW Old Nokomis and the sea-gulls END
BEGIN NOW Stripped the oily flesh of Nahma, END
BEGIN NOW Till the waves washed through the rib-bones, END
BEGIN NOW Till the sea-gulls came no longer, END
BEGIN NOW And upon the sands lay nothing END
BEGIN NOW But the skeleton of Nahma. END
BEGIN NOW On the shores of Gitche Gumee, END
BEGIN NOW Of the shining Big-Sea-Water, END
BEGIN NOW Stood Nokomis, the old woman, END
BEGIN NOW Pointing with her finger westward, END
BEGIN NOW O'er the water pointing westward, END
BEGIN NOW To the purple clouds of sunset. END
BEGIN NOW Fiercely the red sun descending END
BEGIN NOW Burned his way along the heavens, END
BEGIN NOW Set the sky on fire behind him, END
BEGIN NOW As war-parties, when retreating, END
BEGIN NOW Burn the prairies on their war-trail; END
BEGIN NOW And the moon, the Night-sun, eastward, END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly starting from his ambush, END
BEGIN NOW Followed fast those bloody footprints, END
BEGIN NOW Followed in that fiery war-trail, END
BEGIN NOW With its glare upon his features. END
BEGIN NOW And Nokomis, the old woman, END
BEGIN NOW Pointing with her finger westward, END
BEGIN NOW Spake these words to Hiawatha: END
BEGIN NOW Yonder dwells the great Pearl-Feather, END
BEGIN NOW Guarded by his fiery serpents, END
BEGIN NOW Guarded by the black pitch-water. END
BEGIN NOW You can see his fiery serpents, END
BEGIN NOW The Kenabeek, the great serpents, END
BEGIN NOW Coiling, playing in the water; END
BEGIN NOW You can see the black pitch-water END
BEGIN NOW Stretching far away beyond them, END
BEGIN NOW To the purple clouds of sunset! END
BEGIN NOW He it was who slew my father, END
BEGIN NOW By his wicked wiles and cunning, END
BEGIN NOW When he from the moon descended, END
BEGIN NOW When he came on earth to seek me. END
BEGIN NOW He, the mightiest of Magicians, END
BEGIN NOW Sends the fever from the marshes, END
BEGIN NOW Sends the pestilential vapors, END
BEGIN NOW Sends the poisonous exhalations, END
BEGIN NOW Sends the white fog from the fen-lands, END
BEGIN NOW Sends disease and death among us! END
BEGIN NOW Take your bow, O Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Take your arrows, jasper-headed, END
BEGIN NOW Take your war-club, Puggawaugun, END
BEGIN NOW And your mittens, Minjekahwun, END
BEGIN NOW And your birch-canoe for sailing, END
BEGIN NOW So to smear its sides, that swiftly END
BEGIN NOW You may pass the black pitch-water; END
BEGIN NOW Slay this merciless magician, END
BEGIN NOW Save the people from the fever END
BEGIN NOW That he breathes across the fen-lands, END
BEGIN NOW And avenge my father's murder! END
BEGIN NOW Straightway then my Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Armed himself with all his war-gear, END
BEGIN NOW Launched his birch-canoe for sailing; END
BEGIN NOW With his palm its sides he patted, END
BEGIN NOW Said with glee, "Cheemaun, my darling, END
BEGIN NOW O my Birch-canoe! leap forward, END
BEGIN NOW Where you see the fiery serpents, END
BEGIN NOW Where you see the black pitch-water! END
BEGIN NOW Forward leaped Cheemaun exulting, END
BEGIN NOW And the noble Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Sang his war-song wild and woful, END
BEGIN NOW And above him the war-eagle, END
BEGIN NOW The Keneu, the great war-eagle, END
BEGIN NOW Master of all fowls with feathers, END
BEGIN NOW Screamed and hurtled through the heavens. END
BEGIN NOW Soon he reached the fiery serpents, END
BEGIN NOW The Kenabeek, the great serpents, END
BEGIN NOW Lying huge upon the water, END
BEGIN NOW Sparkling, rippling in the water, END
BEGIN NOW Lying coiled across the passage, END
BEGIN NOW With their blazing crests uplifted, END
BEGIN NOW Breathing fiery fogs and vapors, END
BEGIN NOW So that none could pass beyond them. END
BEGIN NOW But the fearless Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Cried aloud, and spake in this wise, END
BEGIN NOW Let me pass my way, Kenabeek, END
BEGIN NOW Let me go upon my journey! END
BEGIN NOW And they answered, hissing fiercely, END
BEGIN NOW With their fiery breath made answer: END
BEGIN NOW Back, go back! O Shaugodaya! END
BEGIN NOW Back to old Nokomis, Faint-heart! END
BEGIN NOW Then the angry Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Raised his mighty bow of ash-tree, END
BEGIN NOW Seized his arrows, jasper-headed, END
BEGIN NOW Shot them fast among the serpents; END
BEGIN NOW Every twanging of the bow-string END
BEGIN NOW Was a war-cry and a death-cry, END
BEGIN NOW Every whizzing of an arrow END
BEGIN NOW Was a death-song of Kenabeek. END
BEGIN NOW Weltering in the bloody water, END
BEGIN NOW Dead lay all the fiery serpents, END
BEGIN NOW And among them Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Harmless sailed, and cried exulting: END
BEGIN NOW Onward, O Cheemaun, my darling! END
BEGIN NOW Onward to the black pitch-water! END
BEGIN NOW Then he took the oil of Nahma, END
BEGIN NOW And the bows and sides anointed, END
BEGIN NOW Smeared them well with oil, that swiftly END
BEGIN NOW He might pass the black pitch-water. END
BEGIN NOW All night long he sailed upon it, END
BEGIN NOW Sailed upon that sluggish water, END
BEGIN NOW Covered with its mould of ages, END
BEGIN NOW Black with rotting water-rushes, END
BEGIN NOW Rank with flags and leaves of lilies, END
BEGIN NOW Stagnant, lifeless, dreary, dismal, END
BEGIN NOW Lighted by the shimmering moonlight, END
BEGIN NOW And by will-o'-the-wisps illumined, END
BEGIN NOW Fires by ghosts of dead men kindled, END
BEGIN NOW In their weary night-encampments. END
BEGIN NOW All the air was white with moonlight, END
BEGIN NOW All the water black with shadow, END
BEGIN NOW And around him the Suggema, END
BEGIN NOW The mosquito, sang his war-song, END
BEGIN NOW And the fire-flies, Wah-wah-taysee, END
BEGIN NOW Waved their torches to mislead him; END
BEGIN NOW And the bull-frog, the Dahinda, END
BEGIN NOW Thrust his head into the moonlight, END
BEGIN NOW Fixed his yellow eyes upon him, END
BEGIN NOW Sobbed and sank beneath the surface; END
BEGIN NOW And anon a thousand whistles, END
BEGIN NOW Answered over all the fen-lands, END
BEGIN NOW And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah, END
BEGIN NOW Far off on the reedy margin, END
BEGIN NOW Heralded the hero's coming. END
BEGIN NOW Westward thus fared Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Toward the realm of Megissogwon, END
BEGIN NOW Toward the land of the Pearl-Feather, END
BEGIN NOW Till the level moon stared at him END
BEGIN NOW In his face stared pale and haggard, END
BEGIN NOW Till the sun was hot behind him, END
BEGIN NOW Till it burned upon his shoulders, END
BEGIN NOW And before him on the upland END
BEGIN NOW He could see the Shining Wigwam END
BEGIN NOW Of the mightiest of Magicians. END
BEGIN NOW Then once more Cheemaun he patted, END
BEGIN NOW To his birch-canoe said, Onward! END
BEGIN NOW And it stirred in all its fibres, END
BEGIN NOW And with one great bound of triumph END
BEGIN NOW Leaped across the water-lilies, END
BEGIN NOW Leaped through tangled flags and rushes, END
BEGIN NOW And upon the beach beyond them END
BEGIN NOW Dry-shod landed Hiawatha. END
BEGIN NOW Straight he took his bow of ash-tree, END
BEGIN NOW On the sand one end he rested, END
BEGIN NOW With his knee he pressed the middle, END
BEGIN NOW Stretched the faithful bow-string tighter, END
BEGIN NOW Took an arrow, jasperheaded, END
BEGIN NOW Sent it singing as a herald, END
BEGIN NOW As a bearer of his message, END
BEGIN NOW Of his challenge loud and lofty: END
BEGIN NOW Come forth from your lodge, Pearl-Feather! END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha waits your coming! END
BEGIN NOW Straightway from the Shining Wigwam END
BEGIN NOW Came the mighty Megissogwon, END
BEGIN NOW Tall of stature, broad of shoulder, END
BEGIN NOW Dark and terrible in aspect, END
BEGIN NOW Clad from head to foot in wampum, END
BEGIN NOW Armed with all his warlike weapons, END
BEGIN NOW Painted like the sky of morning, END
BEGIN NOW Streaked with crimson, blue, and yellow, END
BEGIN NOW Crested with great eagle-feathers, END
BEGIN NOW Streaming upward, streaming outward. END
BEGIN NOW Well I know you, Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW Cried he in a voice of thunder, END
BEGIN NOW In a tone of loud derision. END
BEGIN NOW Hasten back, O Shaugodaya! END
BEGIN NOW Hasten back among the women, END
BEGIN NOW Back to old Nokomis, Faint-heart! END
BEGIN NOW I will slay you as you stand there, END
BEGIN NOW As of old I slew her father! END
BEGIN NOW But my Hiawatha answered, END
BEGIN NOW Nothing daunted, fearing nothing: END
BEGIN NOW Big words do not smite like war-clubs, END
BEGIN NOW Boastful breath is not a bow-string, END
BEGIN NOW Taunts are not so sharp as arrows, END
BEGIN NOW Deeds are better things than words are, END
BEGIN NOW Actions mightier than boastings! END
BEGIN NOW Then began the greatest battle END
BEGIN NOW That the sun had ever looked on, END
BEGIN NOW That the war-birds ever witnessed. END
BEGIN NOW All a Summer's day it lasted, END
BEGIN NOW From the sunrise to the sunset; END
BEGIN NOW For the shafts of Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Harmless hit the shirt of wampum, END
BEGIN NOW Harmless fell the blows he dealt it END
BEGIN NOW With his mittens, Minjekahwun, END
BEGIN NOW Harmless fell the heavy war-club; END
BEGIN NOW It could dash the rocks asunder, END
BEGIN NOW But it could not break the meshes END
BEGIN NOW Of that magic shirt of wampum. END
BEGIN NOW Till at sunset Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Leaning on his bow of ash-tree, END
BEGIN NOW Wounded, weary, and desponding, END
BEGIN NOW With his mighty war-club broken, END
BEGIN NOW With his mittens torn and tattered, END
BEGIN NOW And three useless arrows only, END
BEGIN NOW Paused to rest beneath a pine-tree, END
BEGIN NOW From whose branches trailed the mosses, END
BEGIN NOW And whose trunk was coated over END
BEGIN NOW With the Dead-man's Moccasin-leather, END
BEGIN NOW With the fungus white and yellow. END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly from the boughs above him END
BEGIN NOW Sang the Mama, the woodpecker: END
BEGIN NOW Aim your arrows, Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW At the head of Megissogwon, END
BEGIN NOW Strike the tuft of hair upon it, END
BEGIN NOW At their roots the long black tresses; END
BEGIN NOW There alone can he be wounded! END
BEGIN NOW Winged with feathers, tipped with jasper, END
BEGIN NOW Swift flew Hiawatha's arrow, END
BEGIN NOW Just as Megissogwon, stooping, END
BEGIN NOW Raised a heavy stone to throw it. END
BEGIN NOW Full upon the crown it struck him, END
BEGIN NOW At the roots of his long tresses, END
BEGIN NOW And he reeled and staggered forward, END
BEGIN NOW Plunging like a wounded bison, END
BEGIN NOW Yes, like Pezhekee, the bison, END
BEGIN NOW When the snow is on the prairie. END
BEGIN NOW Swifter flew the second arrow, END
BEGIN NOW In the pathway of the other, END
BEGIN NOW Piercing deeper than the other, END
BEGIN NOW Wounding sorer than the other; END
BEGIN NOW And the knees of Megissogwon END
BEGIN NOW Shook like windy reeds beneath him, END
BEGIN NOW Bent and trembled like the rushes. END
BEGIN NOW But the third and latest arrow END
BEGIN NOW Swiftest flew, and wounded sorest, END
BEGIN NOW And the mighty Megissogwon END
BEGIN NOW Saw the fiery eyes of Pauguk, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the eyes of Death glare at him, END
BEGIN NOW Heard his voice call in the darkness; END
BEGIN NOW At the feet of Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Lifeless lay the great Pearl-Feather, END
BEGIN NOW Lay the mightiest of Magicians. END
BEGIN NOW Then the grateful Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Called the Mama, the woodpecker, END
BEGIN NOW From his perch among the branches END
BEGIN NOW Of the melancholy pine-tree, END
BEGIN NOW And, in honor of his service, END
BEGIN NOW Stained with blood the tuft of feathers END
BEGIN NOW On the little head of Mama; END
BEGIN NOW Even to this day he wears it, END
BEGIN NOW Wears the tuft of crimson feathers, END
BEGIN NOW As a symbol of his service. END
BEGIN NOW Then he stripped the shirt of wampum END
BEGIN NOW From the back of Megissogwon, END
BEGIN NOW As a trophy of the battle, END
BEGIN NOW As a signal of his conquest. END
BEGIN NOW On the shore he left the body, END
BEGIN NOW Half on land and half in water, END
BEGIN NOW In the sand his feet were buried, END
BEGIN NOW And his face was in the water. END
BEGIN NOW And above him, wheeled and clamored END
BEGIN NOW The Keneu, the great war-eagle, END
BEGIN NOW Sailing round in narrower circles, END
BEGIN NOW Hovering nearer, nearer, nearer. END
BEGIN NOW From the wigwam Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Bore the wealth of Megissogwon, END
BEGIN NOW All his wealth of skins and wampum, END
BEGIN NOW Furs of bison and of beaver, END
BEGIN NOW Furs of sable and of ermine, END
BEGIN NOW Wampum belts and strings and pouches, END
BEGIN NOW Quivers wrought with beads of wampum, END
BEGIN NOW Filled with arrows, silver-headed. END
BEGIN NOW Homeward then he sailed exulting, END
BEGIN NOW Homeward through the black pitch-water, END
BEGIN NOW Homeward through the weltering serpents, END
BEGIN NOW With the trophies of the battle, END
BEGIN NOW With a shout and song of triumph. END
BEGIN NOW On the shore stood old Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW On the shore stood Chibiabos, END
BEGIN NOW And the very strong man, Kwasind, END
BEGIN NOW Waiting for the hero's coming, END
BEGIN NOW Listening to his songs of triumph. END
BEGIN NOW And the people of the village END
BEGIN NOW Welcomed him with songs and dances, END
BEGIN NOW Made a joyous feast, and shouted: END
BEGIN NOW He has slain the great Pearl-Feather, END
BEGIN NOW Slain the mightiest of Magicians, END
BEGIN NOW Him, who sent the fiery fever, END
BEGIN NOW Sent the white fog from the fen-lands, END
BEGIN NOW Sent disease and death among us! END
BEGIN NOW Ever dear to Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Was the memory of Mama! END
BEGIN NOW And in token of his friendship, END
BEGIN NOW As a mark of his remembrance, END
BEGIN NOW He adorned and decked his pipe-stem END
BEGIN NOW With the crimson tuft of feathers, END
BEGIN NOW With the blood-red crest of Mama. END
BEGIN NOW But the wealth of Megissogwon, END
BEGIN NOW All the trophies of the battle, END
BEGIN NOW He divided with his people, END
BEGIN NOW Shared it equally among them. END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha's Wooing END
BEGIN NOW As unto the bow the cord is, END
BEGIN NOW So unto the man is woman; END
BEGIN NOW Though she bends him, she obeys him, END
BEGIN NOW Though she draws him, yet she follows; END
BEGIN NOW Useless each without the other! END
BEGIN NOW Thus the youthful Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Said within himself and pondered, END
BEGIN NOW Much perplexed by various feelings, END
BEGIN NOW Listless, longing, hoping, fearing, END
BEGIN NOW Dreaming still of Minnehaha, END
BEGIN NOW Of the lovely Laughing Water, END
BEGIN NOW In the land of the Dacotahs. END
BEGIN NOW Wed a maiden of your people, END
BEGIN NOW Warning said the old Nokomis; END
BEGIN NOW Go not eastward, go not westward, END
BEGIN NOW For a stranger, whom we know not! END
BEGIN NOW Like a fire upon the hearth-stone END
BEGIN NOW Is a neighbor's homely daughter, END
BEGIN NOW Like the starlight or the moonlight END
BEGIN NOW Is the handsomest of strangers! END
BEGIN NOW Thus dissuading spake Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW And my Hiawatha answered END
BEGIN NOW Only this: "Dear old Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW Very pleasant is the firelight, END
BEGIN NOW But I like the starlight better, END
BEGIN NOW Better do I like the moonlight! END
BEGIN NOW Gravely then said old Nokomis: END
BEGIN NOW Bring not here an idle maiden, END
BEGIN NOW Bring not here a useless woman, END
BEGIN NOW Hands unskilful, feet unwilling; END
BEGIN NOW Bring a wife with nimble fingers, END
BEGIN NOW Heart and hand that move together, END
BEGIN NOW Feet that run on willing errands! END
BEGIN NOW Smiling answered Hiawatha: END
BEGIN NOW In the land of the Dacotahs END
BEGIN NOW Lives the Arrow-maker's daughter, END
BEGIN NOW Handsomest of all the women. END
BEGIN NOW I will bring her to your wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW She shall run upon your errands, END
BEGIN NOW Be your starlight, moonlight, firelight, END
BEGIN NOW Be the sunlight of my people! END
BEGIN NOW Still dissuading said Nokomis: END
BEGIN NOW Bring not to my lodge a stranger END
BEGIN NOW From the land of the Dacotahs! END
BEGIN NOW Very fierce are the Dacotahs, END
BEGIN NOW Often is there war between us, END
BEGIN NOW There are feuds yet unforgotten, END
BEGIN NOW Wounds that ache and still may open! END
BEGIN NOW Laughing answered Hiawatha: END
BEGIN NOW For that reason, if no other, END
BEGIN NOW Would I wed the fair Dacotah, END
BEGIN NOW That our tribes might be united, END
BEGIN NOW That old feuds might be forgotten, END
BEGIN NOW And old wounds be healed forever! END
BEGIN NOW Thus departed Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW To the land of the Dacotahs, END
BEGIN NOW To the land of handsome women; END
BEGIN NOW Striding over moor and meadow, END
BEGIN NOW Through interminable forests, END
BEGIN NOW Through uninterrupted silence. END
BEGIN NOW With his moccasins of magic, END
BEGIN NOW At each stride a mile he measured; END
BEGIN NOW Yet the way seemed long before him, END
BEGIN NOW And his heart outran his footsteps; END
BEGIN NOW And he journeyed without resting, END
BEGIN NOW Till he heard the cataract's laughter, END
BEGIN NOW Calling to him through the silence. END
BEGIN NOW Pleasant is the sound!" he murmured, END
BEGIN NOW Pleasant is the voice that calls me! END
BEGIN NOW On the outskirts of the forests, END
BEGIN NOW 'Twixt the shadow and the sunshine, END
BEGIN NOW Herds of fallow deer were feeding, END
BEGIN NOW But they saw not Hiawatha; END
BEGIN NOW To his bow he whispered, "Fail not! END
BEGIN NOW To his arrow whispered, "Swerve not! END
BEGIN NOW Sent it singing on its errand, END
BEGIN NOW To the red heart of the roebuck; END
BEGIN NOW Threw the deer across his shoulder, END
BEGIN NOW And sped forward without pausing. END
BEGIN NOW At the doorway of his wigwam END
BEGIN NOW Sat the ancient Arrow-maker, END
BEGIN NOW In the land of the Dacotahs, END
BEGIN NOW Making arrow-heads of jasper, END
BEGIN NOW Arrow-heads of chalcedony. END
BEGIN NOW At his side, in all her beauty, END
BEGIN NOW Sat the lovely Minnehaha, END
BEGIN NOW Sat his daughter, Laughing Water, END
BEGIN NOW Plaiting mats of flags and rushes END
BEGIN NOW Of the past the old man's thoughts were, END
BEGIN NOW And the maiden's of the future. END
BEGIN NOW He was thinking, as he sat there, END
BEGIN NOW Of the days when with such arrows END
BEGIN NOW He had struck the deer and bison, END
BEGIN NOW On the Muskoday, the meadow; END
BEGIN NOW Shot the wild goose, flying southward END
BEGIN NOW On the wing, the clamorous Wawa; END
BEGIN NOW Thinking of the great war-parties, END
BEGIN NOW How they came to buy his arrows, END
BEGIN NOW Could not fight without his arrows. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, no more such noble warriors END
BEGIN NOW Could be found on earth as they were! END
BEGIN NOW Now the men were all like women, END
BEGIN NOW Only used their tongues for weapons! END
BEGIN NOW She was thinking of a hunter, END
BEGIN NOW From another tribe and country, END
BEGIN NOW Young and tall and very handsome, END
BEGIN NOW Who one morning, in the Spring-time, END
BEGIN NOW Came to buy her father's arrows, END
BEGIN NOW Sat and rested in the wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW Lingered long about the doorway, END
BEGIN NOW Looking back as he departed. END
BEGIN NOW She had heard her father praise him, END
BEGIN NOW Praise his courage and his wisdom; END
BEGIN NOW Would he come again for arrows END
BEGIN NOW On the mat her hands lay idle, END
BEGIN NOW And her eyes were very dreamy. END
BEGIN NOW Through their thoughts they heard a footstep, END
BEGIN NOW Heard a rustling in the branches, END
BEGIN NOW And with glowing cheek and forehead, END
BEGIN NOW With the deer upon his shoulders, END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly from out the woodlands END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha stood before them. END
BEGIN NOW Straight the ancient Arrow-maker END
BEGIN NOW Looked up gravely from his labor, END
BEGIN NOW Laid aside the unfinished arrow, END
BEGIN NOW Bade him enter at the doorway, END
BEGIN NOW Saying, as he rose to meet him, END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha, you are welcome! END
BEGIN NOW At the feet of Laughing Water END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha laid his burden, END
BEGIN NOW Threw the red deer from his shoulders; END
BEGIN NOW And the maiden looked up at him, END
BEGIN NOW Looked up from her mat of rushes, END
BEGIN NOW Said with gentle look and accent, END
BEGIN NOW You are welcome, Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW Very spacious was the wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW Made of deer-skins dressed and whitened, END
BEGIN NOW Drawn and painted on its curtains, END
BEGIN NOW And so tall the doorway, hardly END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha stooped to enter, END
BEGIN NOW Hardly touched his eagle-feathers END
BEGIN NOW As he entered at the doorway. END
BEGIN NOW Then uprose the Laughing Water, END
BEGIN NOW From the ground fair Minnehaha, END
BEGIN NOW Laid aside her mat unfinished, END
BEGIN NOW Brought forth food and set before them, END
BEGIN NOW Water brought them from the brooklet, END
BEGIN NOW Gave them food in earthen vessels, END
BEGIN NOW Gave them drink in bowls of bass-wood, END
BEGIN NOW Listened while the guest was speaking, END
BEGIN NOW Listened while her father answered, END
BEGIN NOW But not once her lips she opened, END
BEGIN NOW Not a single word she uttered. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, as in a dream she listened END
BEGIN NOW To the words of Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW As he talked of old Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW Who had nursed him in his childhood, END
BEGIN NOW As he told of his companions, END
BEGIN NOW Chibiabos, the musician, END
BEGIN NOW And the very strong man, Kwasind, END
BEGIN NOW And of happiness and plenty END
BEGIN NOW In the land of the Ojibways, END
BEGIN NOW In the pleasant land and peaceful. END
BEGIN NOW After many years of warfare, END
BEGIN NOW Many years of strife and bloodshed, END
BEGIN NOW There is peace between the Ojibways END
BEGIN NOW And the tribe of the Dacotahs. END
BEGIN NOW Thus continued Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW And then added, speaking slowly, END
BEGIN NOW That this peace may last forever, END
BEGIN NOW And our hands be clasped more closely, END
BEGIN NOW And our hearts be more united, END
BEGIN NOW Give me as my wife this maiden, END
BEGIN NOW Loveliest of Dacotah women! END
BEGIN NOW And the ancient Arrow-maker END
BEGIN NOW Paused a moment ere he answered, END
BEGIN NOW Smoked a little while in silence, END
BEGIN NOW Looked at Hiawatha proudly, END
BEGIN NOW Fondly looked at Laughing Water, END
BEGIN NOW And made answer very gravely: END
BEGIN NOW Yes, if Minnehaha wishes; END
BEGIN NOW Let your heart speak, Minnehaha! END
BEGIN NOW And the lovely Laughing Water END
BEGIN NOW Seemed more lovely as she stood there, END
BEGIN NOW Neither willing nor reluctant, END
BEGIN NOW As she went to Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Softly took the seat beside him, END
BEGIN NOW While she said, and blushed to say it, END
BEGIN NOW I will follow you, my husband! END
BEGIN NOW This was Hiawatha's wooing! END
BEGIN NOW Thus it was he won the daughter END
BEGIN NOW Of the ancient Arrow-maker, END
BEGIN NOW In the land of the Dacotahs! END
BEGIN NOW From the wigwam he departed, END
BEGIN NOW Leading with him Laughing Water; END
BEGIN NOW Hand in hand they went together, END
BEGIN NOW Through the woodland and the meadow, END
BEGIN NOW Left the old man standing lonely END
BEGIN NOW At the doorway of his wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW Calling to them from the distance, END
BEGIN NOW Crying to them from afar off, END
BEGIN NOW Fare thee well, O Minnehaha! END
BEGIN NOW And the ancient Arrow-maker END
BEGIN NOW Turned again unto his labor, END
BEGIN NOW Sat down by his sunny doorway, END
BEGIN NOW Murmuring to himself, and saying: END
BEGIN NOW Thus it is our daughters leave us, END
BEGIN NOW Those we love, and those who love us! END
BEGIN NOW Just when they have learned to help us, END
BEGIN NOW When we are old and lean upon them, END
BEGIN NOW Comes a youth with flaunting feathers, END
BEGIN NOW With his flute of reeds, a stranger END
BEGIN NOW Wanders piping through the village, END
BEGIN NOW Beckons to the fairest maiden, END
BEGIN NOW And she follows where he leads her, END
BEGIN NOW Leaving all things for the stranger! END
BEGIN NOW Pleasant was the journey homeward, END
BEGIN NOW Through interminable forests, END
BEGIN NOW Over meadow, over mountain, END
BEGIN NOW Over river, hill, and hollow. END
BEGIN NOW Short it seemed to Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Though they journeyed very slowly, END
BEGIN NOW Though his pace he checked and slackened END
BEGIN NOW To the steps of Laughing Water. END
BEGIN NOW Over wide and rushing rivers END
BEGIN NOW In his arms he bore the maiden; END
BEGIN NOW Light he thought her as a feather, END
BEGIN NOW As the plume upon his head-gear; END
BEGIN NOW Cleared the tangled pathway for her, END
BEGIN NOW Bent aside the swaying branches, END
BEGIN NOW Made at night a lodge of branches, END
BEGIN NOW And a bed with boughs of hemlock, END
BEGIN NOW And a fire before the doorway END
BEGIN NOW With the dry cones of the pine-tree. END
BEGIN NOW All the travelling winds went with them, END
BEGIN NOW O'er the meadows, through the forest; END
BEGIN NOW All the stars of night looked at them, END
BEGIN NOW Watched with sleepless eyes their slumber; END
BEGIN NOW From his ambush in the oak-tree END
BEGIN NOW Peeped the squirrel, Adjidaumo, END
BEGIN NOW Watched with eager eyes the lovers; END
BEGIN NOW And the rabbit, the Wabasso, END
BEGIN NOW Scampered from the path before them, END
BEGIN NOW Peering, peeping from his burrow, END
BEGIN NOW Sat erect upon his haunches, END
BEGIN NOW Watched with curious eyes the lovers. END
BEGIN NOW Pleasant was the journey homeward! END
BEGIN NOW All the birds sang loud and sweetly END
BEGIN NOW Songs of happiness and heart's-ease; END
BEGIN NOW Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa, END
BEGIN NOW Happy are you, Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Having such a wife to love you! END
BEGIN NOW Sang the robin, the Opechee, END
BEGIN NOW Happy are you, Laughing Water, END
BEGIN NOW Having such a noble husband! END
BEGIN NOW From the sky the sun benignant END
BEGIN NOW Looked upon them through the branches, END
BEGIN NOW Saying to them, "O my children, END
BEGIN NOW Love is sunshine, hate is shadow, END
BEGIN NOW Life is checkered shade and sunshine, END
BEGIN NOW Rule by love, O Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW From the sky the moon looked at them, END
BEGIN NOW Filled the lodge with mystic splendors, END
BEGIN NOW Whispered to them, "O my children, END
BEGIN NOW Day is restless, night is quiet, END
BEGIN NOW Man imperious, woman feeble; END
BEGIN NOW Half is mine, although I follow; END
BEGIN NOW Rule by patience, Laughing Water! END
BEGIN NOW Thus it was they journeyed homeward; END
BEGIN NOW Thus it was that Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW To the lodge of old Nokomis END
BEGIN NOW Brought the moonlight, starlight, firelight, END
BEGIN NOW Brought the sunshine of his people, END
BEGIN NOW Handsomest of all the women END
BEGIN NOW In the land of the Dacotahs, END
BEGIN NOW In the land of handsome women. END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha's Wedding-Feast END
BEGIN NOW You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW How the handsome Yenadizze END
BEGIN NOW Danced at Hiawatha's wedding; END
BEGIN NOW How the gentle Chibiabos, END
BEGIN NOW He the sweetest of musicians, END
BEGIN NOW Sang his songs of love and longing; END
BEGIN NOW How Iagoo, the great boaster, END
BEGIN NOW He the marvellous story-teller, END
BEGIN NOW Told his tales of strange adventure, END
BEGIN NOW That the feast might be more joyous, END
BEGIN NOW That the time might pass more gayly, END
BEGIN NOW And the guests be more contented. END
BEGIN NOW Sumptuous was the feast Nokomis END
BEGIN NOW Made at Hiawatha's wedding; END
BEGIN NOW All the bowls were made of bass-wood, END
BEGIN NOW White and polished very smoothly, END
BEGIN NOW All the spoons of horn of bison, END
BEGIN NOW Black and polished very smoothly. END
BEGIN NOW She had sent through all the village END
BEGIN NOW Messengers with wands of willow, END
BEGIN NOW As a sign of invitation, END
BEGIN NOW As a token of the feasting; END
BEGIN NOW And the wedding guests assembled, END
BEGIN NOW Clad in all their richest raiment, END
BEGIN NOW Robes of fur and belts of wampum, END
BEGIN NOW Splendid with their paint and plumage, END
BEGIN NOW Beautiful with beads and tassels. END
BEGIN NOW First they ate the sturgeon, Nahma, END
BEGIN NOW And the pike, the Maskenozha, END
BEGIN NOW Caught and cooked by old Nokomis; END
BEGIN NOW Then on pemican they feasted, END
BEGIN NOW Pemican and buffalo marrow, END
BEGIN NOW Haunch of deer and hump of bison, END
BEGIN NOW Yellow cakes of the Mondamin, END
BEGIN NOW And the wild rice of the river. END
BEGIN NOW But the gracious Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW And the lovely Laughing Water, END
BEGIN NOW And the careful old Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW Tasted not the food before them, END
BEGIN NOW Only waited on the others END
BEGIN NOW Only served their guests in silence. END
BEGIN NOW And when all the guests had finished, END
BEGIN NOW Old Nokomis, brisk and busy, END
BEGIN NOW From an ample pouch of otter, END
BEGIN NOW Filled the red-stone pipes for smoking END
BEGIN NOW With tobacco from the South-land, END
BEGIN NOW Mixed with bark of the red willow, END
BEGIN NOW And with herbs and leaves of fragrance. END
BEGIN NOW Then she said, "O Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Dance for us your merry dances, END
BEGIN NOW Dance the Beggar's Dance to please us, END
BEGIN NOW That the feast may be more joyous, END
BEGIN NOW That the time may pass more gayly, END
BEGIN NOW And our guests be more contented! END
BEGIN NOW Then the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW He the idle Yenadizze, END
BEGIN NOW He the merry mischief-maker, END
BEGIN NOW Whom the people called the Storm-Fool, END
BEGIN NOW Rose among the guests assembled. END
BEGIN NOW Skilled was he in sports and pastimes, END
BEGIN NOW In the merry dance of snow-shoes, END
BEGIN NOW In the play of quoits and ball-play; END
BEGIN NOW Skilled was he in games of hazard, END
BEGIN NOW In all games of skill and hazard, END
BEGIN NOW Kuntassoo, the Game of Plum-stones. END
BEGIN NOW Though the warriors called him Faint-Heart, END
BEGIN NOW Called him coward, Shaugodaya, END
BEGIN NOW Idler, gambler, Yenadizze, END
BEGIN NOW Little heeded he their jesting, END
BEGIN NOW Little cared he for their insults, END
BEGIN NOW For the women and the maidens END
BEGIN NOW Loved the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis. END
BEGIN NOW He was dressed in shirt of doeskin, END
BEGIN NOW White and soft, and fringed with ermine, END
BEGIN NOW All inwrought with beads of wampum; END
BEGIN NOW He was dressed in deer-skin leggings, END
BEGIN NOW Fringed with hedgehog quills and ermine, END
BEGIN NOW And in moccasins of buck-skin, END
BEGIN NOW Thick with quills and beads embroidered. END
BEGIN NOW On his head were plumes of swan's down, END
BEGIN NOW On his heels were tails of foxes, END
BEGIN NOW In one hand a fan of feathers, END
BEGIN NOW And a pipe was in the other. END
BEGIN NOW Barred with streaks of red and yellow, END
BEGIN NOW Streaks of blue and bright vermilion, END
BEGIN NOW Shone the face of Pau-Puk-Keewis. END
BEGIN NOW From his forehead fell his tresses, END
BEGIN NOW Smooth, and parted like a woman's, END
BEGIN NOW Shining bright with oil, and plaited, END
BEGIN NOW Hung with braids of scented grasses, END
BEGIN NOW As among the guests assembled, END
BEGIN NOW To the sound of flutes and singing, END
BEGIN NOW To the sound of drums and voices, END
BEGIN NOW Rose the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW And began his mystic dances. END
BEGIN NOW First he danced a solemn measure, END
BEGIN NOW Very slow in step and gesture, END
BEGIN NOW In and out among the pine-trees, END
BEGIN NOW Through the shadows and the sunshine, END
BEGIN NOW Treading softly like a panther. END
BEGIN NOW Then more swiftly and still swifter, END
BEGIN NOW Whirling, spinning round in circles, END
BEGIN NOW Leaping o'er the guests assembled, END
BEGIN NOW Eddying round and round the wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW Till the leaves went whirling with him, END
BEGIN NOW Till the dust and wind together END
BEGIN NOW Swept in eddies round about him. END
BEGIN NOW Then along the sandy margin END
BEGIN NOW Of the lake, the Big-Sea-Water, END
BEGIN NOW On he sped with frenzied gestures, END
BEGIN NOW Stamped upon the sand, and tossed it END
BEGIN NOW Wildly in the air around him; END
BEGIN NOW Till the wind became a whirlwind, END
BEGIN NOW Till the sand was blown and sifted END
BEGIN NOW Like great snowdrifts o'er the landscape, END
BEGIN NOW Heaping all the shores with Sand Dunes, END
BEGIN NOW Thus the merry Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW Danced his Beggar's Dance to please them, END
BEGIN NOW And, returning, sat down laughing END
BEGIN NOW There among the guests assembled, END
BEGIN NOW Sat and fanned himself serenely END
BEGIN NOW With his fan of turkey-feathers. END
BEGIN NOW Then they said to Chibiabos, END
BEGIN NOW To the friend of Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW To the sweetest of all singers, END
BEGIN NOW To the best of all musicians, END
BEGIN NOW Songs of love and songs of longing, END
BEGIN NOW That the feast may be more joyous, END
BEGIN NOW That the time may pass more gayly, END
BEGIN NOW And our guests be more contented! END
BEGIN NOW And the gentle Chibiabos END
BEGIN NOW Sang in accents sweet and tender, END
BEGIN NOW Sang in tones of deep emotion, END
BEGIN NOW Songs of love and songs of longing; END
BEGIN NOW Looking still at Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Looking at fair Laughing Water, END
BEGIN NOW Sang he softly, sang in this wise: END
BEGIN NOW Onaway! Awake, beloved! END
BEGIN NOW Thou the wild-flower of the forest! END
BEGIN NOW Thou the wild-bird of the prairie! END
BEGIN NOW Thou with eyes so soft and fawn-like! END
BEGIN NOW If thou only lookest at me, END
BEGIN NOW I am happy, I am happy, END
BEGIN NOW As the lilies of the prairie, END
BEGIN NOW When they feel the dew upon them! END
BEGIN NOW Sweet thy breath is as the fragrance END
BEGIN NOW Of the wild-flowers in the morning, END
BEGIN NOW As their fragrance is at evening, END
BEGIN NOW In the Moon when leaves are falling. END
BEGIN NOW Does not all the blood within me END
BEGIN NOW Leap to meet thee, leap to meet thee, END
BEGIN NOW As the springs to meet the sunshine, END
BEGIN NOW In the Moon when nights are brightest? END
BEGIN NOW Onaway! my heart sings to thee, END
BEGIN NOW Sings with joy when thou art near me, END
BEGIN NOW As the sighing, singing branches END
BEGIN NOW In the pleasant Moon of Strawberries! END
BEGIN NOW When thou art not pleased, beloved, END
BEGIN NOW Then my heart is sad and darkened, END
BEGIN NOW As the shining river darkens END
BEGIN NOW When the clouds drop shadows on it! END
BEGIN NOW When thou smilest, my beloved, END
BEGIN NOW Then my troubled heart is brightened, END
BEGIN NOW As in sunshine gleam the ripples END
BEGIN NOW That the cold wind makes in rivers. END
BEGIN NOW Smiles the earth, and smile the waters, END
BEGIN NOW Smile the cloudless skies above us, END
BEGIN NOW But I lose the way of smiling END
BEGIN NOW When thou art no longer near me! END
BEGIN NOW I myself, myself! behold me! END
BEGIN NOW Blood of my beating heart, behold me! END
BEGIN NOW Oh awake, awake, beloved! END
BEGIN NOW Onaway! awake, beloved! END
BEGIN NOW Thus the gentle Chibiabos END
BEGIN NOW Sang his song of love and longing; END
BEGIN NOW And Iagoo, the great boaster, END
BEGIN NOW He the marvellous story-teller, END
BEGIN NOW He the friend of old Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW Jealous of the sweet musician, END
BEGIN NOW Jealous of the applause they gave him, END
BEGIN NOW Saw in all the eyes around him, END
BEGIN NOW Saw in all their looks and gestures, END
BEGIN NOW That the wedding guests assembled END
BEGIN NOW Longed to hear his pleasant stories, END
BEGIN NOW His immeasurable falsehoods. END
BEGIN NOW Very boastful was Iagoo; END
BEGIN NOW Never heard he an adventure END
BEGIN NOW But himself had met a greater; END
BEGIN NOW Never any deed of daring END
BEGIN NOW But himself had done a bolder; END
BEGIN NOW Never any marvellous story END
BEGIN NOW But himself could tell a stranger. END
BEGIN NOW Would you listen to his boasting, END
BEGIN NOW Would you only give him credence, END
BEGIN NOW No one ever shot an arrow END
BEGIN NOW Half so far and high as he had; END
BEGIN NOW Ever caught so many fishes, END
BEGIN NOW Ever killed so many reindeer, END
BEGIN NOW Ever trapped so many beaver! END
BEGIN NOW None could run so fast as he could, END
BEGIN NOW None could dive so deep as he could, END
BEGIN NOW None could swim so far as he could; END
BEGIN NOW None had made so many journeys, END
BEGIN NOW None had seen so many wonders, END
BEGIN NOW As this wonderful Iagoo, END
BEGIN NOW As this marvellous story-teller! END
BEGIN NOW Thus his name became a by-word END
BEGIN NOW And a jest among the people; END
BEGIN NOW And whene'er a boastful hunter END
BEGIN NOW Praised his own address too highly, END
BEGIN NOW Or a warrior, home returning, END
BEGIN NOW Talked too much of his achievements, END
BEGIN NOW All his hearers cried, Iagoo! END
BEGIN NOW Here's Iagoo come among us! END
BEGIN NOW He it was who carved the cradle END
BEGIN NOW Of the little Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Carved its framework out of linden, END
BEGIN NOW Bound it strong with reindeer sinews; END
BEGIN NOW He it was who taught him later END
BEGIN NOW How to make his bows and arrows, END
BEGIN NOW How to make the bows of ash-tree, END
BEGIN NOW And the arrows of the oak-tree. END
BEGIN NOW So among the guests assembled END
BEGIN NOW At my Hiawatha's wedding END
BEGIN NOW Sat Iagoo, old and ugly, END
BEGIN NOW Sat the marvellous story-teller. END
BEGIN NOW And they said, "O good Iagoo, END
BEGIN NOW Tell us now a tale of wonder, END
BEGIN NOW Tell us of some strange adventure, END
BEGIN NOW That the feast may be more joyous, END
BEGIN NOW That the time may pass more gayly, END
BEGIN NOW And our guests be more contented! END
BEGIN NOW And Iagoo answered straightway, END
BEGIN NOW You shall hear a tale of wonder, END
BEGIN NOW You shall hear the strange adventures END
BEGIN NOW From the Evening Star descending. END
BEGIN NOW Can it be the sun descending END
BEGIN NOW O'er the level plain of water? END
BEGIN NOW Or the Red Swan floating, flying, END
BEGIN NOW Wounded by the magic arrow, END
BEGIN NOW Staining all the waves with crimson, END
BEGIN NOW With the crimson of its life-blood, END
BEGIN NOW Filling all the air with splendor, END
BEGIN NOW With the splendor of its plumage? END
BEGIN NOW Yes; it is the sun descending, END
BEGIN NOW Sinking down into the water; END
BEGIN NOW All the sky is stained with purple, END
BEGIN NOW All the water flushed with crimson! END
BEGIN NOW No; it is the Red Swan floating, END
BEGIN NOW Diving down beneath the water; END
BEGIN NOW To the sky its wings are lifted, END
BEGIN NOW With its blood the waves are reddened! END
BEGIN NOW Melts and trembles through the purple, END
BEGIN NOW Hangs suspended in the twilight. END
BEGIN NOW No; it is a bead of wampum END
BEGIN NOW On the robes of the Great Spirit END
BEGIN NOW As he passes through the twilight, END
BEGIN NOW Walks in silence through the heavens. END
BEGIN NOW This with joy beheld Iagoo END
BEGIN NOW And he said in haste: "Behold it! END
BEGIN NOW See the sacred Star of Evening! END
BEGIN NOW You shall hear a tale of wonder, END
BEGIN NOW Hear the story of Osseo, END
BEGIN NOW Once, in days no more remembered, END
BEGIN NOW Ages nearer the beginning, END
BEGIN NOW When the heavens were closer to us, END
BEGIN NOW And the Gods were more familiar, END
BEGIN NOW In the North-land lived a hunter, END
BEGIN NOW With ten young and comely daughters, END
BEGIN NOW Tall and lithe as wands of willow; END
BEGIN NOW Only Oweenee, the youngest, END
BEGIN NOW She the wilful and the wayward, END
BEGIN NOW She the silent, dreamy maiden, END
BEGIN NOW Was the fairest of the sisters. END
BEGIN NOW All these women married warriors, END
BEGIN NOW Married brave and haughty husbands; END
BEGIN NOW Only Oweenee, the youngest, END
BEGIN NOW Laughed and flouted all her lovers, END
BEGIN NOW All her young and handsome suitors, END
BEGIN NOW And then married old Osseo, END
BEGIN NOW Old Osseo, poor and ugly, END
BEGIN NOW Broken with age and weak with coughing, END
BEGIN NOW Always coughing like a squirrel. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, but beautiful within him END
BEGIN NOW Was the spirit of Osseo, END
BEGIN NOW From the Evening Star descended, END
BEGIN NOW Star of tenderness and passion! END
BEGIN NOW All its fire was in his bosom, END
BEGIN NOW All its beauty in his spirit, END
BEGIN NOW All its mystery in his being, END
BEGIN NOW All its splendor in his language! END
BEGIN NOW And her lovers, the rejected, END
BEGIN NOW Handsome men with belts of wampum, END
BEGIN NOW Handsome men with paint and feathers. END
BEGIN NOW Pointed at her in derision, END
BEGIN NOW Followed her with jest and laughter. END
BEGIN NOW But she said: 'I care not for you, END
BEGIN NOW Care not for your belts of wampum, END
BEGIN NOW Care not for your paint and feathers, END
BEGIN NOW Care not for your jests and laughter; END
BEGIN NOW I am happy with Osseo!' END
BEGIN NOW Once to some great feast invited, END
BEGIN NOW Through the damp and dusk of evening, END
BEGIN NOW Walked together the ten sisters, END
BEGIN NOW Walked together with their husbands; END
BEGIN NOW Slowly followed old Osseo, END
BEGIN NOW With fair Oweenee beside him; END
BEGIN NOW All the others chatted gayly, END
BEGIN NOW These two only walked in silence. END
BEGIN NOW At the western sky Osseo END
BEGIN NOW Gazed intent, as if imploring, END
BEGIN NOW Often stopped and gazed imploring END
BEGIN NOW At the trembling Star of Evening, END
BEGIN NOW At the tender Star of Woman; END
BEGIN NOW And they heard him murmur softly, END
BEGIN NOW 'Ah, showain nemeshin, Nosa! END
BEGIN NOW Pity, pity me, my father!' END
BEGIN NOW 'Listen!' said the eldest sister, END
BEGIN NOW 'He is praying to his father! END
BEGIN NOW What a pity that the old man END
BEGIN NOW Does not stumble in the pathway, END
BEGIN NOW Does not break his neck by falling!' END
BEGIN NOW And they laughed till all the forest END
BEGIN NOW Rang with their unseemly laughter. END
BEGIN NOW On their pathway through the woodlands END
BEGIN NOW Lay an oak, by storms uprooted, END
BEGIN NOW Lay the great trunk of an oak-tree, END
BEGIN NOW Buried half in leaves and mosses, END
BEGIN NOW Mouldering, crumbling, huge and hollow. END
BEGIN NOW And Osseo, when he saw it, END
BEGIN NOW Gave a shout, a cry of anguish, END
BEGIN NOW Leaped into its yawning cavern, END
BEGIN NOW At one end went in an old man, END
BEGIN NOW Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly; END
BEGIN NOW From the other came a young man, END
BEGIN NOW Tall and straight and strong and handsome. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Osseo was transfigured, END
BEGIN NOW Thus restored to youth and beauty; END
BEGIN NOW But, alas for good Osseo, END
BEGIN NOW And for Oweenee, the faithful! END
BEGIN NOW Strangely, too, was she transfigured. END
BEGIN NOW Changed into a weak old woman, END
BEGIN NOW With a staff she tottered onward, END
BEGIN NOW Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly! END
BEGIN NOW And the sisters and their husbands END
BEGIN NOW Laughed until the echoing forest END
BEGIN NOW Rang with their unseemly laughter. END
BEGIN NOW But Osseo turned not from her, END
BEGIN NOW Walked with slower step beside her, END
BEGIN NOW Took her hand, as brown and withered END
BEGIN NOW As an oak-leaf is in Winter, END
BEGIN NOW Called her sweetheart, Nenemoosha, END
BEGIN NOW Soothed her with soft words of kindness, END
BEGIN NOW Till they reached the lodge of feasting, END
BEGIN NOW Till they sat down in the wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW To the tender Star of Woman. END
BEGIN NOW Wrapt in visions, lost in dreaming, END
BEGIN NOW At the banquet sat Osseo; END
BEGIN NOW All were merry, all were happy, END
BEGIN NOW All were joyous but Osseo. END
BEGIN NOW Neither food nor drink he tasted, END
BEGIN NOW Neither did he speak nor listen; END
BEGIN NOW But as one bewildered sat he, END
BEGIN NOW Looking dreamily and sadly, END
BEGIN NOW First at Oweenee, then upward END
BEGIN NOW At the gleaming sky above them. END
BEGIN NOW Then a voice was heard, a whisper, END
BEGIN NOW Coming from the starry distance, END
BEGIN NOW Coming from the empty vastness, END
BEGIN NOW Low, and musical, and tender; END
BEGIN NOW And the voice said: 'O Osseo! END
BEGIN NOW O my son, my best beloved! END
BEGIN NOW Broken are the spells that bound you, END
BEGIN NOW All the charms of the magicians, END
BEGIN NOW All the magic powers of evil; END
BEGIN NOW Come to me; ascend, Osseo! END
BEGIN NOW 'Taste the food that stands before you: END
BEGIN NOW It is blessed and enchanted, END
BEGIN NOW It has magic virtues in it, END
BEGIN NOW It will change you to a spirit. END
BEGIN NOW All your bowls and all your kettles END
BEGIN NOW Shall be wood and clay no longer; END
BEGIN NOW But the bowls be changed to wampum, END
BEGIN NOW And the kettles shall be silver; END
BEGIN NOW They shall shine like shells of scarlet, END
BEGIN NOW Like the fire shall gleam and glimmer. END
BEGIN NOW 'And the women shall no longer END
BEGIN NOW Bear the dreary doom of labor, END
BEGIN NOW But be changed to birds, and glisten END
BEGIN NOW With the beauty of the starlight, END
BEGIN NOW Painted with the dusky splendors END
BEGIN NOW Of the skies and clouds of evening!' END
BEGIN NOW What Osseo heard as whispers, END
BEGIN NOW What as words he comprehended, END
BEGIN NOW Was but music to the others, END
BEGIN NOW Music as of birds afar off, END
BEGIN NOW Of the whippoorwill afar off, END
BEGIN NOW Of the lonely Wawonaissa END
BEGIN NOW Singing in the darksome forest. END
BEGIN NOW Then the lodge began to tremble, END
BEGIN NOW Straight began to shake and tremble, END
BEGIN NOW And they felt it rising, rising, END
BEGIN NOW Slowly through the air ascending, END
BEGIN NOW From the darkness of the tree-tops END
BEGIN NOW Forth into the dewy starlight, END
BEGIN NOW Till it passed the topmost branches; END
BEGIN NOW And behold! the wooden dishes END
BEGIN NOW All were changed to shells of scarlet! END
BEGIN NOW And behold! the earthen kettles END
BEGIN NOW All were changed to bowls of silver! END
BEGIN NOW And the roof-poles of the wigwam END
BEGIN NOW Were as glittering rods of silver, END
BEGIN NOW And the roof of bark upon them END
BEGIN NOW As the shining shards of beetles. END
BEGIN NOW Then Osseo gazed around him, END
BEGIN NOW And he saw the nine fair sisters, END
BEGIN NOW All the sisters and their husbands, END
BEGIN NOW Changed to birds of various plumage. END
BEGIN NOW Some were jays and some were magpies, END
BEGIN NOW Others thrushes, others blackbirds; END
BEGIN NOW And they hopped, and sang, and twittered, END
BEGIN NOW Perked and fluttered all their feathers, END
BEGIN NOW Strutted in their shining plumage, END
BEGIN NOW And their tails like fans unfolded. END
BEGIN NOW Only Oweenee, the youngest, END
BEGIN NOW Was not changed, but sat in silence, END
BEGIN NOW Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly, END
BEGIN NOW Looking sadly at the others; END
BEGIN NOW Till Osseo, gazing upward, END
BEGIN NOW Gave another cry of anguish, END
BEGIN NOW Such a cry as he had uttered END
BEGIN NOW By the oak-tree in the forest. END
BEGIN NOW Then returned her youth and beauty, END
BEGIN NOW And her soiled and tattered garments END
BEGIN NOW Were transformed to robes of ermine, END
BEGIN NOW And her staff became a feather, END
BEGIN NOW Yes, a shining silver feather! END
BEGIN NOW And again the wigwam trembled, END
BEGIN NOW Swayed and rushed through airy currents, END
BEGIN NOW Through transparent cloud and vapor, END
BEGIN NOW And amid celestial splendors END
BEGIN NOW On the Evening Star alighted, END
BEGIN NOW As a snow-flake falls on snow-flake, END
BEGIN NOW As a leaf drops on a river, END
BEGIN NOW As the thistledown on water. END
BEGIN NOW Forth with cheerful words of welcome END
BEGIN NOW Came the father of Osseo, END
BEGIN NOW He with radiant locks of silver, END
BEGIN NOW He with eyes serene and tender. END
BEGIN NOW And he said: `My son, Osseo, END
BEGIN NOW Hang the cage of birds you bring there, END
BEGIN NOW Hang the cage with rods of silver, END
BEGIN NOW And the birds with glistening feathers, END
BEGIN NOW At the doorway of my wigwam.' END
BEGIN NOW At the door he hung the bird-cage, END
BEGIN NOW And they entered in and gladly END
BEGIN NOW Listened to Osseo's father, END
BEGIN NOW As he said: `O my Osseo! END
BEGIN NOW I have had compassion on you, END
BEGIN NOW Given you back your youth and beauty, END
BEGIN NOW Into birds of various plumage END
BEGIN NOW Changed your sisters and their husbands; END
BEGIN NOW Changed them thus because they mocked you END
BEGIN NOW In the figure of the old man, END
BEGIN NOW In that aspect sad and wrinkled, END
BEGIN NOW Could not see your heart of passion, END
BEGIN NOW Could not see your youth immortal; END
BEGIN NOW Only Oweenee, the faithful, END
BEGIN NOW Saw your naked heart and loved you. END
BEGIN NOW `In the lodge that glimmers yonder, END
BEGIN NOW In the little star that twinkles END
BEGIN NOW Through the vapors, on the left hand, END
BEGIN NOW Lives the envious Evil Spirit, END
BEGIN NOW The Wabeno, the magician, END
BEGIN NOW Who transformed you to an old man. END
BEGIN NOW Take heed lest his beams fall on you, END
BEGIN NOW For the rays he darts around him END
BEGIN NOW Are the power of his enchantment, END
BEGIN NOW Are the arrows that he uses.' END
BEGIN NOW Many years, in peace and quiet, END
BEGIN NOW On the peaceful Star of Evening END
BEGIN NOW Dwelt Osseo with his father; END
BEGIN NOW Many years, in song and flutter, END
BEGIN NOW At the doorway of the wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW Hung the cage with rods of silver, END
BEGIN NOW And fair Oweenee, the faithful, END
BEGIN NOW Bore a son unto Osseo, END
BEGIN NOW With the beauty of his mother, END
BEGIN NOW With the courage of his father. END
BEGIN NOW And the boy grew up and prospered, END
BEGIN NOW And Osseo, to delight him, END
BEGIN NOW Made him little bows and arrows, END
BEGIN NOW Opened the great cage of silver, END
BEGIN NOW And let loose his aunts and uncles, END
BEGIN NOW All those birds with glossy feathers, END
BEGIN NOW For his little son to shoot at. END
BEGIN NOW Round and round they wheeled and darted, END
BEGIN NOW Filled the Evening Star with music, END
BEGIN NOW With their songs of joy and freedom END
BEGIN NOW Filled the Evening Star with splendor, END
BEGIN NOW With the fluttering of their plumage; END
BEGIN NOW Till the boy, the little hunter, END
BEGIN NOW Bent his bow and shot an arrow, END
BEGIN NOW Shot a swift and fatal arrow, END
BEGIN NOW And a bird, with shining feathers, END
BEGIN NOW At his feet fell wounded sorely. END
BEGIN NOW But, O wondrous transformation! END
BEGIN NOW `T was no bird he saw before him, END
BEGIN NOW `T was a beautiful young woman, END
BEGIN NOW With the arrow in her bosom! END
BEGIN NOW When her blood fell on the planet, END
BEGIN NOW On the sacred Star of Evening, END
BEGIN NOW Broken was the spell of magic, END
BEGIN NOW Powerless was the strange enchantment, END
BEGIN NOW And the youth, the fearless bowman, END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly felt himself descending, END
BEGIN NOW Held by unseen hands, but sinking END
BEGIN NOW Downward through the empty spaces, END
BEGIN NOW Downward through the clouds and vapors, END
BEGIN NOW Till he rested on an island, END
BEGIN NOW On an island, green and grassy, END
BEGIN NOW After him he saw descending END
BEGIN NOW All the birds with shining feathers, END
BEGIN NOW Fluttering, falling, wafted downward, END
BEGIN NOW Like the painted leaves of Autumn; END
BEGIN NOW And the lodge with poles of silver, END
BEGIN NOW With its roof like wings of beetles, END
BEGIN NOW Like the shining shards of beetles, END
BEGIN NOW By the winds of heaven uplifted, END
BEGIN NOW Slowly sank upon the island, END
BEGIN NOW Bringing back the good Osseo, END
BEGIN NOW Bringing Oweenee, the faithful. END
BEGIN NOW Then the birds, again transfigured, END
BEGIN NOW Reassumed the shape of mortals, END
BEGIN NOW Took their shape, but not their stature; END
BEGIN NOW They remained as Little People, END
BEGIN NOW Like the pygmies, the Puk-Wudjies, END
BEGIN NOW And on pleasant nights of Summer, END
BEGIN NOW When the Evening Star was shining, END
BEGIN NOW Hand in hand they danced together END
BEGIN NOW On the island's craggy headlands, END
BEGIN NOW On the sand-beach low and level. END
BEGIN NOW Still their glittering lodge is seen there, END
BEGIN NOW On the tranquil Summer evenings, END
BEGIN NOW And upon the shore the fisher END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes hears their happy voices, END
BEGIN NOW Sees them dancing in the starlight ! END
BEGIN NOW When the story was completed, END
BEGIN NOW When the wondrous tale was ended, END
BEGIN NOW Looking round upon his listeners, END
BEGIN NOW Solemnly Iagoo added: END
BEGIN NOW There are great men, I have known such, END
BEGIN NOW Whom their people understand not, END
BEGIN NOW Whom they even make a jest of, END
BEGIN NOW Scoff and jeer at in derision. END
BEGIN NOW From the story of Osseo END
BEGIN NOW Let us learn the fate of jesters! END
BEGIN NOW All the wedding guests delighted END
BEGIN NOW Listened to the marvellous story, END
BEGIN NOW Listened laughing and applauding, END
BEGIN NOW And they whispered to each other: END
BEGIN NOW Does he mean himself, I wonder? END
BEGIN NOW And are we the aunts and uncles? END
BEGIN NOW Then again sang Chibiabos, END
BEGIN NOW Sang a song of love and longing, END
BEGIN NOW In those accents sweet and tender, END
BEGIN NOW In those tones of pensive sadness, END
BEGIN NOW Sang a maiden's lamentation END
BEGIN NOW For her lover, her Algonquin. END
BEGIN NOW When I think of my beloved, END
BEGIN NOW Ah me! think of my beloved, END
BEGIN NOW When my heart is thinking of him, END
BEGIN NOW O my sweetheart, my Algonquin! END
BEGIN NOW Ah me! when I parted from him, END
BEGIN NOW Round my neck he hung the wampum, END
BEGIN NOW As a pledge, the snow-white wampum, END
BEGIN NOW O my sweetheart, my Algonquin! END
BEGIN NOW 'I will go with you,' he whispered, END
BEGIN NOW 'Ah me! to your native country; END
BEGIN NOW Let me go with you,' he whispered, END
BEGIN NOW 'O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!' END
BEGIN NOW 'Far away, away,' I answered, END
BEGIN NOW 'Very far away,' I answered, END
BEGIN NOW 'Ah me! is my native country, END
BEGIN NOW O my sweetheart, my Algonquin!' END
BEGIN NOW When I looked back to behold him, END
BEGIN NOW Where we parted, to behold him, END
BEGIN NOW After me he still was gazing, END
BEGIN NOW O my sweetheart, my Algonquin! END
BEGIN NOW By the tree he still was standing, END
BEGIN NOW By the fallen tree was standing, END
BEGIN NOW That had dropped into the water, END
BEGIN NOW O my sweetheart, my Algonquin! END
BEGIN NOW When I think of my beloved, END
BEGIN NOW Ah me! think of my beloved, END
BEGIN NOW When my heart is thinking of him, END
BEGIN NOW O my sweetheart, my Algonquin! END
BEGIN NOW Such was Hiawatha's Wedding, END
BEGIN NOW Such the dance of Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Such the story of Iagoo, END
BEGIN NOW Such the songs of Chibiabos; END
BEGIN NOW Thus the wedding banquet ended, END
BEGIN NOW And the wedding guests departed, END
BEGIN NOW Leaving Hiawatha happy END
BEGIN NOW With the night and Minnehaha. END
BEGIN NOW Of the happy days that followed, END
BEGIN NOW In the land of the Ojibways, END
BEGIN NOW In the pleasant land and peaceful! END
BEGIN NOW Sing the mysteries of Mondamin, END
BEGIN NOW Buried was the bloody hatchet, END
BEGIN NOW Buried was the dreadful war-club, END
BEGIN NOW Buried were all warlike weapons, END
BEGIN NOW And the war-cry was forgotten. END
BEGIN NOW There was peace among the nations; END
BEGIN NOW Unmolested roved the hunters, END
BEGIN NOW Built the birch canoe for sailing, END
BEGIN NOW Caught the fish in lake and river, END
BEGIN NOW Shot the deer and trapped the beaver; END
BEGIN NOW Unmolested worked the women, END
BEGIN NOW Made their sugar from the maple, END
BEGIN NOW Gathered wild rice in the meadows, END
BEGIN NOW Dressed the skins of deer and beaver. END
BEGIN NOW All around the happy village END
BEGIN NOW Stood the maize-fields, green and shining, END
BEGIN NOW Waved the green plumes of Mondamin, END
BEGIN NOW Waved his soft and sunny tresses, END
BEGIN NOW Filling all the land with plenty. END
BEGIN NOW `T was the women who in Spring-time END
BEGIN NOW Planted the broad fields and fruitful, END
BEGIN NOW Buried in the earth Mondamin; END
BEGIN NOW `T was the women who in Autumn END
BEGIN NOW Stripped the yellow husks of harvest, END
BEGIN NOW Stripped the garments from Mondamin, END
BEGIN NOW Even as Hiawatha taught them. END
BEGIN NOW Once, when all the maize was planted, END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha, wise and thoughtful, END
BEGIN NOW Spake and said to Minnehaha, END
BEGIN NOW To his wife, the Laughing Water: END
BEGIN NOW You shall bless to-night the cornfields, END
BEGIN NOW Draw a magic circle round them, END
BEGIN NOW To protect them from destruction, END
BEGIN NOW Blast of mildew, blight of insect, END
BEGIN NOW Wagemin, the thief of cornfields, END
BEGIN NOW Paimosaid, who steals the maize-ear. END
BEGIN NOW In the night, when all is silence, END
BEGIN NOW In the night, when all is darkness, END
BEGIN NOW Shuts the doors of all the wigwams, END
BEGIN NOW So that not an ear can hear you, END
BEGIN NOW So that not an eye can see you, END
BEGIN NOW Rise up from your bed in silence, END
BEGIN NOW Lay aside your garments wholly, END
BEGIN NOW Walk around the fields you planted, END
BEGIN NOW Round the borders of the cornfields, END
BEGIN NOW Covered by your tresses only, END
BEGIN NOW Robed with darkness as a garment. END
BEGIN NOW Thus the fields shall be more fruitful, END
BEGIN NOW And the passing of your footsteps END
BEGIN NOW Draw a magic circle round them, END
BEGIN NOW So that neither blight nor mildew, END
BEGIN NOW Neither burrowing worm nor insect, END
BEGIN NOW Shall pass o'er the magic circle; END
BEGIN NOW Not the dragon-fly, Kwo-ne-she, END
BEGIN NOW Nor the spider, Subbekashe, END
BEGIN NOW Nor the grasshopper, Pah-puk-keena; END
BEGIN NOW Nor the mighty caterpillar, END
BEGIN NOW Way-muk-kwana, with the bear-skin, END
BEGIN NOW King of all the caterpillars! END
BEGIN NOW On the tree-tops near the cornfields END
BEGIN NOW Sat the hungry crows and ravens, END
BEGIN NOW With his band of black marauders. END
BEGIN NOW And they laughed at Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Till the tree-tops shook with laughter, END
BEGIN NOW With their melancholy laughter, END
BEGIN NOW At the words of Hiawatha. END
BEGIN NOW Hear him!" said they; "hear the Wise Man, END
BEGIN NOW Hear the plots of Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW When the noiseless night descended END
BEGIN NOW Broad and dark o'er field and forest, END
BEGIN NOW When the mournful Wawonaissa END
BEGIN NOW Sorrowing sang among the hemlocks, END
BEGIN NOW Shut the doors of all the wigwams, END
BEGIN NOW From her bed rose Laughing Water, END
BEGIN NOW Laid aside her garments wholly, END
BEGIN NOW And with darkness clothed and guarded, END
BEGIN NOW Unashamed and unaffrighted, END
BEGIN NOW Walked securely round the cornfields, END
BEGIN NOW Drew the sacred, magic circle END
BEGIN NOW Of her footprints round the cornfields. END
BEGIN NOW No one but the Midnight only END
BEGIN NOW Saw her beauty in the darkness, END
BEGIN NOW Heard the panting of her bosom END
BEGIN NOW Guskewau, the darkness, wrapped her END
BEGIN NOW Closely in his sacred mantle, END
BEGIN NOW So that none might see her beauty, END
BEGIN NOW So that none might boast, "I saw her! END
BEGIN NOW On the morrow, as the day dawned, END
BEGIN NOW Gathered all his black marauders, END
BEGIN NOW Crows and blackbirds, jays and ravens, END
BEGIN NOW Clamorous on the dusky tree-tops, END
BEGIN NOW And descended, fast and fearless, END
BEGIN NOW On the fields of Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW On the grave of the Mondamin. END
BEGIN NOW We will drag Mondamin," said they, END
BEGIN NOW From the grave where he is buried, END
BEGIN NOW Spite of all the magic circles END
BEGIN NOW Laughing Water draws around it, END
BEGIN NOW Spite of all the sacred footprints END
BEGIN NOW Minnehaha stamps upon it! END
BEGIN NOW But the wary Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Ever thoughtful, careful, watchful, END
BEGIN NOW Had o'erheard the scornful laughter END
BEGIN NOW When they mocked him from the tree-tops. END
BEGIN NOW Kaw! he said, "my friends the ravens! END
BEGIN NOW I will teach you all a lesson END
BEGIN NOW That shall not be soon forgotten! END
BEGIN NOW He had risen before the daybreak, END
BEGIN NOW He had spread o'er all the cornfields END
BEGIN NOW Snares to catch the black marauders, END
BEGIN NOW And was lying now in ambush END
BEGIN NOW In the neighboring grove of pine-trees, END
BEGIN NOW Waiting for the crows and blackbirds, END
BEGIN NOW Waiting for the jays and ravens. END
BEGIN NOW Soon they came with caw and clamor, END
BEGIN NOW Rush of wings and cry of voices, END
BEGIN NOW To their work of devastation, END
BEGIN NOW Settling down upon the cornfields, END
BEGIN NOW Delving deep with beak and talon, END
BEGIN NOW For the body of Mondamin. END
BEGIN NOW And with all their craft and cunning, END
BEGIN NOW All their skill in wiles of warfare, END
BEGIN NOW They perceived no danger near them, END
BEGIN NOW Till their claws became entangled, END
BEGIN NOW Till they found themselves imprisoned END
BEGIN NOW In the snares of Hiawatha. END
BEGIN NOW From his place of ambush came he, END
BEGIN NOW Striding terrible among them, END
BEGIN NOW And so awful was his aspect END
BEGIN NOW That the bravest quailed with terror. END
BEGIN NOW Without mercy he destroyed them END
BEGIN NOW Right and left, by tens and twenties, END
BEGIN NOW And their wretched, lifeless bodies END
BEGIN NOW Hung aloft on poles for scarecrows END
BEGIN NOW Round the consecrated cornfields, END
BEGIN NOW As a signal of his vengeance, END
BEGIN NOW As a warning to marauders. END
BEGIN NOW Only Kahgahgee, the leader, END
BEGIN NOW He alone was spared among them END
BEGIN NOW As a hostage for his people. END
BEGIN NOW With his prisoner-string he bound him, END
BEGIN NOW Led him captive to his wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW Tied him fast with cords of elm-bark END
BEGIN NOW To the ridge-pole of his wigwam. END
BEGIN NOW Kahgahgee, my raven!" said he, END
BEGIN NOW You the leader of the robbers, END
BEGIN NOW You the plotter of this mischief, END
BEGIN NOW The contriver of this outrage, END
BEGIN NOW I will keep you, I will hold you, END
BEGIN NOW As a hostage for your people, END
BEGIN NOW As a pledge of good behavior! END
BEGIN NOW And he left him, grim and sulky, END
BEGIN NOW Sitting in the morning sunshine END
BEGIN NOW On the summit of the wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW Croaking fiercely his displeasure, END
BEGIN NOW Flapping his great sable pinions, END
BEGIN NOW Vainly struggling for his freedom, END
BEGIN NOW Vainly calling on his people! END
BEGIN NOW Summer passed, and Shawondasee END
BEGIN NOW Breathed his sighs o'er all the landscape, END
BEGIN NOW From the South-land sent his ardor, END
BEGIN NOW Wafted kisses warm and tender; END
BEGIN NOW And the maize-field grew and ripened, END
BEGIN NOW Till it stood in all the splendor END
BEGIN NOW Of its garments green and yellow, END
BEGIN NOW Of its tassels and its plumage, END
BEGIN NOW And the maize-ears full and shining END
BEGIN NOW Gleamed from bursting sheaths of verdure. END
BEGIN NOW Then Nokomis, the old woman, END
BEGIN NOW Spake, and said to Minnehaha: END
BEGIN NOW 'T is the Moon when, leaves are falling; END
BEGIN NOW All the wild rice has been gathered, END
BEGIN NOW And the maize is ripe and ready; END
BEGIN NOW Let us gather in the harvest, END
BEGIN NOW Let us wrestle with Mondamin, END
BEGIN NOW Strip him of his plumes and tassels, END
BEGIN NOW Of his garments green and yellow! END
BEGIN NOW And the merry Laughing Water END
BEGIN NOW Went rejoicing from the wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW With Nokomis, old and wrinkled, END
BEGIN NOW And they called the women round them, END
BEGIN NOW Called the young men and the maidens, END
BEGIN NOW To the harvest of the cornfields, END
BEGIN NOW To the husking of the maize-ear. END
BEGIN NOW On the border of the forest, END
BEGIN NOW Underneath the fragrant pine-trees, END
BEGIN NOW Sat the old men and the warriors END
BEGIN NOW Smoking in the pleasant shadow. END
BEGIN NOW In uninterrupted silence END
BEGIN NOW Looked they at the gamesome labor END
BEGIN NOW Of the young men and the women; END
BEGIN NOW Listened to their noisy talking, END
BEGIN NOW To their laughter and their singing, END
BEGIN NOW Heard them chattering like the magpies, END
BEGIN NOW Heard them laughing like the blue-jays, END
BEGIN NOW Heard them singing like the robins. END
BEGIN NOW And whene'er some lucky maiden END
BEGIN NOW Found a red ear in the husking, END
BEGIN NOW Found a maize-ear red as blood is, END
BEGIN NOW Nushka! cried they all together, END
BEGIN NOW Nushka! you shall have a sweetheart, END
BEGIN NOW You shall have a handsome husband! END
BEGIN NOW Ugh! the old men all responded END
BEGIN NOW From their seats beneath the pine-trees. END
BEGIN NOW And whene'er a youth or maiden END
BEGIN NOW Found a crooked ear in husking, END
BEGIN NOW Found a maize-ear in the husking END
BEGIN NOW Blighted, mildewed, or misshapen, END
BEGIN NOW Then they laughed and sang together, END
BEGIN NOW Crept and limped about the cornfields, END
BEGIN NOW Mimicked in their gait and gestures END
BEGIN NOW Some old man, bent almost double, END
BEGIN NOW Singing singly or together: END
BEGIN NOW Wagemin, the thief of cornfields! END
BEGIN NOW Paimosaid, who steals the maize-ear! END
BEGIN NOW Till the cornfields rang with laughter, END
BEGIN NOW Till from Hiawatha's wigwam END
BEGIN NOW Screamed and quivered in his anger, END
BEGIN NOW And from all the neighboring tree-tops END
BEGIN NOW Cawed and croaked the black marauders. END
BEGIN NOW Ugh! the old men all responded, END
BEGIN NOW From their seats beneath the pine-trees! END
BEGIN NOW In those days said Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Lo! how all things fade and perish! END
BEGIN NOW From the memory of the old men END
BEGIN NOW Pass away the great traditions, END
BEGIN NOW The achievements of the warriors, END
BEGIN NOW The adventures of the hunters, END
BEGIN NOW All the wisdom of the Medas, END
BEGIN NOW All the craft of the Wabenos, END
BEGIN NOW All the marvellous dreams and visions END
BEGIN NOW Great men die and are forgotten, END
BEGIN NOW Wise men speak; their words of wisdom END
BEGIN NOW Perish in the ears that hear them, END
BEGIN NOW Do not reach the generations END
BEGIN NOW That, as yet unborn, are waiting END
BEGIN NOW In the great, mysterious darkness END
BEGIN NOW Of the speechless days that shall be! END
BEGIN NOW On the grave-posts of our fathers END
BEGIN NOW Are no signs, no figures painted; END
BEGIN NOW Who are in those graves we know not, END
BEGIN NOW Only know they are our fathers. END
BEGIN NOW Of what kith they are and kindred, END
BEGIN NOW From what old, ancestral Totem, END
BEGIN NOW They descended, this we know not, END
BEGIN NOW Only know they are our fathers. END
BEGIN NOW Face to face we speak together, END
BEGIN NOW But we cannot speak when absent, END
BEGIN NOW Cannot send our voices from us END
BEGIN NOW To the friends that dwell afar off; END
BEGIN NOW Cannot send a secret message, END
BEGIN NOW But the bearer learns our secret, END
BEGIN NOW May pervert it, may betray it, END
BEGIN NOW May reveal it unto others. END
BEGIN NOW Thus said Hiawatha, walking END
BEGIN NOW In the solitary forest, END
BEGIN NOW Pondering, musing in the forest, END
BEGIN NOW On the welfare of his people. END
BEGIN NOW From his pouch he took his colors, END
BEGIN NOW Took his paints of different colors, END
BEGIN NOW On the smooth bark of a birch-tree END
BEGIN NOW Painted many shapes and figures, END
BEGIN NOW Wonderful and mystic figures, END
BEGIN NOW And each figure had a meaning, END
BEGIN NOW Each some word or thought suggested. END
BEGIN NOW He, the Master of Life, was painted END
BEGIN NOW As an egg, with points projecting END
BEGIN NOW To the four winds of the heavens. END
BEGIN NOW Was the meaning of this symbol. END
BEGIN NOW He the dreadful Spirit of Evil, END
BEGIN NOW As a serpent was depicted, END
BEGIN NOW As Kenabeek, the great serpent. END
BEGIN NOW Very crafty, very cunning, END
BEGIN NOW Is the creeping Spirit of Evil, END
BEGIN NOW Was the meaning of this symbol. END
BEGIN NOW Life and Death he drew as circles, END
BEGIN NOW Life was white, but Death was darkened; END
BEGIN NOW Sun and moon and stars he painted, END
BEGIN NOW Man and beast, and fish and reptile, END
BEGIN NOW Forests, mountains, lakes, and rivers. END
BEGIN NOW For the earth he drew a straight line, END
BEGIN NOW For the sky a bow above it; END
BEGIN NOW White the space between for daytime, END
BEGIN NOW Filled with little stars for night-time; END
BEGIN NOW On the left a point for sunrise, END
BEGIN NOW On the right a point for sunset, END
BEGIN NOW On the top a point for noontide, END
BEGIN NOW And for rain and cloudy weather END
BEGIN NOW Waving lines descending from it. END
BEGIN NOW Footprints pointing towards a wigwam END
BEGIN NOW Were a sign of invitation, END
BEGIN NOW Were a sign of guests assembling; END
BEGIN NOW Bloody hands with palms uplifted END
BEGIN NOW Were a symbol of destruction, END
BEGIN NOW Were a hostile sign and symbol. END
BEGIN NOW All these things did Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Show unto his wondering people, END
BEGIN NOW And interpreted their meaning, END
BEGIN NOW And he said: "Behold, your grave-posts END
BEGIN NOW Have no mark, no sign, nor symbol, END
BEGIN NOW Go and paint them all with figures; END
BEGIN NOW Each one with its household symbol, END
BEGIN NOW With its own ancestral Totem; END
BEGIN NOW So that those who follow after END
BEGIN NOW May distinguish them and know them. END
BEGIN NOW And they painted on the grave-posts END
BEGIN NOW On the graves yet unforgotten, END
BEGIN NOW Each his own ancestral Totem, END
BEGIN NOW Each the symbol of his household; END
BEGIN NOW Each inverted as a token END
BEGIN NOW That the owner was departed, END
BEGIN NOW That the chief who bore the symbol END
BEGIN NOW Lay beneath in dust and ashes. END
BEGIN NOW And the Medicine-men, the Medas, END
BEGIN NOW Painted upon bark and deer-skin END
BEGIN NOW Figures for the songs they chanted, END
BEGIN NOW For each song a separate symbol, END
BEGIN NOW Figures mystical and awful, END
BEGIN NOW Figures strange and brightly colored; END
BEGIN NOW And each figure had its meaning, END
BEGIN NOW Each some magic song suggested. END
BEGIN NOW Flashing light through all the heaven; END
BEGIN NOW With his bloody crest erected, END
BEGIN NOW Creeping, looking into heaven; END
BEGIN NOW In the sky the sun, that listens, END
BEGIN NOW And the moon eclipsed and dying; END
BEGIN NOW Owl and eagle, crane and hen-hawk, END
BEGIN NOW And the cormorant, bird of magic; END
BEGIN NOW Headless men, that walk the heavens, END
BEGIN NOW Bodies lying pierced with arrows, END
BEGIN NOW Bloody hands of death uplifted, END
BEGIN NOW Flags on graves, and great war-captains END
BEGIN NOW Grasping both the earth and heaven! END
BEGIN NOW Such as these the shapes they painted END
BEGIN NOW On the birch-bark and the deer-skin; END
BEGIN NOW Songs of war and songs of hunting, END
BEGIN NOW Songs of medicine and of magic, END
BEGIN NOW All were written in these figures, END
BEGIN NOW For each figure had its meaning, END
BEGIN NOW Each its separate song recorded. END
BEGIN NOW Nor forgotten was the Love-Song, END
BEGIN NOW The most subtle of all medicines, END
BEGIN NOW The most potent spell of magic, END
BEGIN NOW Dangerous more than war or hunting! END
BEGIN NOW Thus the Love-Song was recorded, END
BEGIN NOW Symbol and interpretation. END
BEGIN NOW First a human figure standing, END
BEGIN NOW Painted in the brightest scarlet; END
BEGIN NOW `T is the lover, the musician, END
BEGIN NOW And the meaning is, "My painting END
BEGIN NOW Makes me powerful over others. END
BEGIN NOW Then the figure seated, singing, END
BEGIN NOW Playing on a drum of magic, END
BEGIN NOW And the interpretation, Listen! END
BEGIN NOW `T is my voice you hear, my singing! END
BEGIN NOW Then the same red figure seated END
BEGIN NOW In the shelter of a wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW And the meaning of the symbol, END
BEGIN NOW I will come and sit beside you END
BEGIN NOW In the mystery of my passion! END
BEGIN NOW Then two figures, man and woman, END
BEGIN NOW Standing hand in hand together END
BEGIN NOW With their hands so clasped together END
BEGIN NOW That they seemed in one united, END
BEGIN NOW And the words thus represented END
BEGIN NOW Are, "I see your heart within you, END
BEGIN NOW And your cheeks are red with blushes! END
BEGIN NOW Next the maiden on an island, END
BEGIN NOW In the centre of an Island; END
BEGIN NOW And the song this shape suggested END
BEGIN NOW Was, "Though you were at a distance, END
BEGIN NOW Were upon some far-off island, END
BEGIN NOW Such the spell I cast upon you, END
BEGIN NOW Such the magic power of passion, END
BEGIN NOW I could straightway draw you to me! END
BEGIN NOW Then the figure of the maiden END
BEGIN NOW Sleeping, and the lover near her, END
BEGIN NOW Whispering to her in her slumbers, END
BEGIN NOW Saying, "Though you were far from me END
BEGIN NOW In the land of Sleep and Silence, END
BEGIN NOW Still the voice of love would reach you! END
BEGIN NOW And the last of all the figures END
BEGIN NOW Was a heart within a circle, END
BEGIN NOW Drawn within a magic circle; END
BEGIN NOW And the image had this meaning: END
BEGIN NOW Naked lies your heart before me, END
BEGIN NOW To your naked heart I whisper! END
BEGIN NOW Thus it was that Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW In his wisdom, taught the people END
BEGIN NOW All the mysteries of painting, END
BEGIN NOW On the smooth bark of the birch-tree, END
BEGIN NOW On the white skin of the reindeer, END

BEGIN NOW Hiawatha's Lamentation END
BEGIN NOW In those days the Evil Spirits, END
BEGIN NOW All the Manitos of mischief, END
BEGIN NOW Fearing Hiawatha's wisdom, END
BEGIN NOW And his love for Chibiabos, END
BEGIN NOW Jealous of their faithful friendship, END
BEGIN NOW And their noble words and actions, END
BEGIN NOW Made at length a league against them, END
BEGIN NOW To molest them and destroy them. END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha, wise and wary, END
BEGIN NOW Often said to Chibiabos, END
BEGIN NOW O my brother! do not leave me, END
BEGIN NOW Lest the Evil Spirits harm you! END
BEGIN NOW Chibiabos, young and heedless, END
BEGIN NOW Laughing shook his coal-black tresses, END
BEGIN NOW Answered ever sweet and childlike, END
BEGIN NOW Do not fear for me, O brother! END
BEGIN NOW Harm and evil come not near me! END
BEGIN NOW Once when Peboan, the Winter, END
BEGIN NOW Roofed with ice the Big-Sea-Water, END
BEGIN NOW When the snow-flakes, whirling downward, END
BEGIN NOW Hissed among the withered oak-leaves, END
BEGIN NOW Changed the pine-trees into wigwams, END
BEGIN NOW Covered all the earth with silence, END
BEGIN NOW Armed with arrows, shod with snow-shoes, END
BEGIN NOW Heeding not his brother's warning, END
BEGIN NOW Forth to hunt the deer with antlers END
BEGIN NOW All alone went Chibiabos. END
BEGIN NOW Right across the Big-Sea-Water END
BEGIN NOW Sprang with speed the deer before him. END
BEGIN NOW With the wind and snow he followed, END
BEGIN NOW O'er the treacherous ice he followed, END
BEGIN NOW Wild with all the fierce commotion END
BEGIN NOW And the rapture of the hunting. END
BEGIN NOW But beneath, the Evil Spirits END
BEGIN NOW Lay in ambush, waiting for him, END
BEGIN NOW Broke the treacherous ice beneath him, END
BEGIN NOW Dragged him downward to the bottom, END
BEGIN NOW Buried in the sand his body. END
BEGIN NOW Unktahee, the god of water, END
BEGIN NOW Drowned him in the deep abysses END
BEGIN NOW Of the lake of Gitche Gumee. END
BEGIN NOW From the headlands Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Sent forth such a wail of anguish, END
BEGIN NOW Such a fearful lamentation, END
BEGIN NOW That the bison paused to listen, END
BEGIN NOW And the wolves howled from the prairies, END
BEGIN NOW And the thunder in the distance END
BEGIN NOW Starting answered Baim-wawa! END
BEGIN NOW Then his face with black he painted, END
BEGIN NOW With his robe his head he covered, END
BEGIN NOW In his wigwam sat lamenting, END
BEGIN NOW Seven long weeks he sat lamenting, END
BEGIN NOW Uttering still this moan of sorrow: END
BEGIN NOW He is dead, the sweet musician! END
BEGIN NOW He the sweetest of all singers! END
BEGIN NOW He has gone from us forever, END
BEGIN NOW He has moved a little nearer END
BEGIN NOW To the Master of all music, END
BEGIN NOW To the Master of all singing! END
BEGIN NOW O my brother, Chibiabos! END
BEGIN NOW And the melancholy fir-trees END
BEGIN NOW Waved their dark green fans above him, END
BEGIN NOW Waved their purple cones above him, END
BEGIN NOW Sighing with him to console him, END
BEGIN NOW Mingling with his lamentation END
BEGIN NOW Their complaining, their lamenting. END
BEGIN NOW Came the Spring, and all the forest END
BEGIN NOW Looked in vain for Chibiabos; END
BEGIN NOW Sighed the rivulet, Sebowisha, END
BEGIN NOW Sighed the rushes in the meadow. END
BEGIN NOW From the tree-tops sang the bluebird, END
BEGIN NOW Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa, END
BEGIN NOW He is dead, the sweet musician! END
BEGIN NOW From the wigwam sang the robin, END
BEGIN NOW Sang the robin, the Opechee, END
BEGIN NOW He is dead, the sweetest singer! END
BEGIN NOW And at night through all the forest END
BEGIN NOW Went the whippoorwill complaining, END
BEGIN NOW Wailing went the Wawonaissa, END
BEGIN NOW He is dead, the sweet musician! END
BEGIN NOW He the sweetest of all singers! END
BEGIN NOW Then the Medicine-men, the Medas, END
BEGIN NOW The magicians, the Wabenos, END
BEGIN NOW Came to visit Hiawatha; END
BEGIN NOW Built a Sacred Lodge beside him, END
BEGIN NOW To appease him, to console him, END
BEGIN NOW Walked in silent, grave procession, END
BEGIN NOW Bearing each a pouch of healing, END
BEGIN NOW Skin of beaver, lynx, or otter, END
BEGIN NOW Filled with magic roots and simples, END
BEGIN NOW Filled with very potent medicines. END
BEGIN NOW When he heard their steps approaching, END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha ceased lamenting, END
BEGIN NOW Called no more on Chibiabos; END
BEGIN NOW Naught he questioned, naught he answered, END
BEGIN NOW But his mournful head uncovered, END
BEGIN NOW From his face the mourning colors END
BEGIN NOW Washed he slowly and in silence, END
BEGIN NOW Slowly and in silence followed END
BEGIN NOW There a magic drink they gave him, END
BEGIN NOW Made of Nahma-wusk, the spearmint, END
BEGIN NOW And Wabeno-wusk, the yarrow, END
BEGIN NOW Roots of power, and herbs of healing; END
BEGIN NOW Beat their drums, and shook their rattles; END
BEGIN NOW Chanted singly and in chorus, END
BEGIN NOW Mystic songs like these, they chanted. END
BEGIN NOW I myself, myself! behold me! END
BEGIN NOW `T is the great Gray Eagle talking; END
BEGIN NOW Come, ye white crows, come and hear him! END
BEGIN NOW The loud-speaking thunder helps me; END
BEGIN NOW All the unseen spirits help me; END
BEGIN NOW I can hear their voices calling, END
BEGIN NOW All around the sky I hear them! END
BEGIN NOW I can blow you strong, my brother, END
BEGIN NOW I can heal you, Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW Hi-au-ha! replied the chorus, END
BEGIN NOW Wayha-way! the mystic chorus. END
BEGIN NOW Friends of mine are all the serpents! END
BEGIN NOW Hear me shake my skin of hen-hawk! END
BEGIN NOW Mahng, the white loon, I can kill him; END
BEGIN NOW I can shoot your heart and kill it! END
BEGIN NOW I can blow you strong, my brother, END
BEGIN NOW I can heal you, Hiawatha ! END
BEGIN NOW Hi-au-ha! replied the chorus, END
BEGIN NOW Wayhaway! the mystic chorus. END
BEGIN NOW I myself, myself! the prophet! END
BEGIN NOW When I speak the wigwam trembles, END
BEGIN NOW Shakes the Sacred Lodge with terror, END
BEGIN NOW Hands unseen begin to shake it! END
BEGIN NOW When I walk, the sky I tread on END
BEGIN NOW Bends and makes a noise beneath me! END
BEGIN NOW I can blow you strong, my brother! END
BEGIN NOW Rise and speak, O Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW Hi-au-ha! replied the chorus, END
BEGIN NOW Way-ha-way! the mystic chorus. END
BEGIN NOW Then they shook their medicine-pouches END
BEGIN NOW O'er the head of Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Danced their medicine-dance around him; END
BEGIN NOW And upstarting wild and haggard, END
BEGIN NOW Like a man from dreams awakened, END
BEGIN NOW He was healed of all his madness. END
BEGIN NOW As the clouds are swept from heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Straightway from his brain departed END
BEGIN NOW All his moody melancholy; END
BEGIN NOW As the ice is swept from rivers, END
BEGIN NOW Straightway from his heart departed END
BEGIN NOW All his sorrow and affliction. END
BEGIN NOW Then they summoned Chibiabos END
BEGIN NOW From his grave beneath the waters, END
BEGIN NOW From the sands of Gitche Gumee END
BEGIN NOW Summoned Hiawatha's brother. END
BEGIN NOW And so mighty was the magic END
BEGIN NOW Of that cry and invocation, END
BEGIN NOW That he heard it as he lay there END
BEGIN NOW From the sand he rose and listened, END
BEGIN NOW Heard the music and the singing, END
BEGIN NOW Came, obedient to the summons, END
BEGIN NOW To the doorway of the wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW But to enter they forbade him. END
BEGIN NOW Through the door a burning fire-brand; END
BEGIN NOW Ruler o'er the dead, they made him, END
BEGIN NOW Telling him a fire to kindle END
BEGIN NOW For all those that died thereafter, END
BEGIN NOW Camp-fires for their night encampments END
BEGIN NOW On their solitary journey END
BEGIN NOW To the kingdom of Ponemah, END
BEGIN NOW To the land of the Hereafter. END
BEGIN NOW From the village of his childhood, END
BEGIN NOW From the homes of those who knew him, END
BEGIN NOW Passing silent through the forest, END
BEGIN NOW Like a smoke-wreath wafted sideways, END
BEGIN NOW Slowly vanished Chibiabos! END
BEGIN NOW Where he passed, the branches moved not, END
BEGIN NOW Where he trod, the grasses bent not, END
BEGIN NOW And the fallen leaves of last year END
BEGIN NOW Made no sound beneath his footstep. END
BEGIN NOW Four whole days he journeyed onward END
BEGIN NOW Down the pathway of the dead men; END
BEGIN NOW On the dead-man's strawberry feasted, END
BEGIN NOW Crossed the melancholy river, END
BEGIN NOW On the swinging log he crossed it, END
BEGIN NOW Came unto the Lake of Silver, END
BEGIN NOW In the Stone Canoe was carried END
BEGIN NOW To the land of ghosts and shadows. END
BEGIN NOW On that journey, moving slowly, END
BEGIN NOW Many weary spirits saw he, END
BEGIN NOW Panting under heavy burdens, END
BEGIN NOW Laden with war-clubs, bows and arrows, END
BEGIN NOW Robes of fur, and pots and kettles, END
BEGIN NOW And with food that friends had given END
BEGIN NOW For that solitary journey. END
BEGIN NOW Ay! why do the living," said they, END
BEGIN NOW Lay such heavy burdens on us! END
BEGIN NOW Better were it to go naked, END
BEGIN NOW Better were it to go fasting, END
BEGIN NOW Than to bear such heavy burdens END
BEGIN NOW On our long and weary journey! END
BEGIN NOW Forth then issued Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Wandered eastward, wandered westward, END
BEGIN NOW Teaching men the use of simples END
BEGIN NOW And the antidotes for poisons, END
BEGIN NOW And the cure of all diseases. END
BEGIN NOW Thus was first made known to mortals END
BEGIN NOW All the mystery of Medamin, END
BEGIN NOW All the sacred art of healing. END
BEGIN NOW You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW He, the handsome Yenadizze, END
BEGIN NOW Whom the people called the Storm-Fool, END
BEGIN NOW Vexed the village with disturbance; END
BEGIN NOW You shall hear of all his mischief, END
BEGIN NOW And his flight from Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW And his wondrous transmigrations, END
BEGIN NOW And the end of his adventures. END
BEGIN NOW On the shores of Gitche Gumee, END
BEGIN NOW On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo, END
BEGIN NOW By the shining Big-Sea-Water END
BEGIN NOW Stood the lodge of Pau-Puk-Keewis. END
BEGIN NOW It was he who in his frenzy END
BEGIN NOW Whirled these drifting sands together, END
BEGIN NOW On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo, END
BEGIN NOW When, among the guests assembled, END
BEGIN NOW He so merrily and madly END
BEGIN NOW Danced at Hiawatha's wedding, END
BEGIN NOW Danced the Beggar's Dance to please them. END
BEGIN NOW Now, in search of new adventures, END
BEGIN NOW From his lodge went Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Came with speed into the village, END
BEGIN NOW Found the young men all assembled END
BEGIN NOW In the lodge of old Iagoo, END
BEGIN NOW Listening to his monstrous stories, END
BEGIN NOW To his wonderful adventures. END
BEGIN NOW He was telling them the story END
BEGIN NOW How he made a hole in heaven, END
BEGIN NOW How he climbed up into heaven, END
BEGIN NOW And let out the summer-weather, END
BEGIN NOW The perpetual, pleasant Summer; END
BEGIN NOW How the Otter first essayed it; END
BEGIN NOW Tried in turn the great achievement, END
BEGIN NOW From the summit of the mountain END
BEGIN NOW Smote their fists against the heavens, END
BEGIN NOW Smote against the sky their foreheads, END
BEGIN NOW Cracked the sky, but could not break it; END
BEGIN NOW How the Wolverine, uprising, END
BEGIN NOW Made him ready for the encounter, END
BEGIN NOW Bent his knees down, like a squirrel, END
BEGIN NOW Drew his arms back, like a cricket. END
BEGIN NOW Once he leaped," said old Iagoo, END
BEGIN NOW Once he leaped, and lo! above him END
BEGIN NOW Bent the sky, as ice in rivers END
BEGIN NOW When the waters rise beneath it; END
BEGIN NOW Twice he leaped, and lo! above him END
BEGIN NOW Cracked the sky, as ice in rivers END
BEGIN NOW When the freshet is at highest! END
BEGIN NOW Thrice he leaped, and lo! above him END
BEGIN NOW Broke the shattered sky asunder, END
BEGIN NOW And he disappeared within it, END
BEGIN NOW With a bound went in behind him! END
BEGIN NOW Hark you!" shouted Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW As he entered at the doorway; END
BEGIN NOW I am tired of all this talking, END
BEGIN NOW Tired of old Iagoo's stories, END
BEGIN NOW Tired of Hiawatha's wisdom. END
BEGIN NOW Here is something to amuse you, END
BEGIN NOW Better than this endless talking. END
BEGIN NOW Then from out his pouch of wolf-skin END
BEGIN NOW Forth he drew, with solemn manner, END
BEGIN NOW All the game of Bowl and Counters, END
BEGIN NOW Pugasaing, with thirteen pieces. END
BEGIN NOW White on one side were they painted, END
BEGIN NOW And vermilion on the other; END
BEGIN NOW Two Kenabeeks or great serpents, END
BEGIN NOW Two Ininewug or wedge-men, END
BEGIN NOW One great war-club, Pugamaugun, END
BEGIN NOW And one slender fish, the Keego, END
BEGIN NOW Four round pieces, Ozawabeeks, END
BEGIN NOW And three Sheshebwug or ducklings. END
BEGIN NOW All were made of bone and painted, END
BEGIN NOW All except the Ozawabeeks; END
BEGIN NOW These were brass, on one side burnished, END
BEGIN NOW And were black upon the other. END
BEGIN NOW In a wooden bowl he placed them, END
BEGIN NOW Shook and jostled them together, END
BEGIN NOW Threw them on the ground before him, END
BEGIN NOW Thus exclaiming and explaining: END
BEGIN NOW Red side up are all the pieces, END
BEGIN NOW And one great Kenabeek standing END
BEGIN NOW On the bright side of a brass piece, END
BEGIN NOW On a burnished Ozawabeek; END
BEGIN NOW Thirteen tens and eight are counted. END
BEGIN NOW Then again he shook the pieces, END
BEGIN NOW Shook and jostled them together, END
BEGIN NOW Threw them on the ground before him, END
BEGIN NOW Still exclaiming and explaining: END
BEGIN NOW White are both the great Kenabeeks, END
BEGIN NOW White the Ininewug, the wedge-men, END
BEGIN NOW Red are all the other pieces; END
BEGIN NOW Five tens and an eight are counted. END
BEGIN NOW Thus he taught the game of hazard, END
BEGIN NOW Thus displayed it and explained it, END
BEGIN NOW Running through its various chances, END
BEGIN NOW Various changes, various meanings: END
BEGIN NOW Twenty curious eyes stared at him, END
BEGIN NOW Full of eagerness stared at him. END
BEGIN NOW Many games," said old Iagoo, END
BEGIN NOW Many games of skill and hazard END
BEGIN NOW Have I seen in different nations, END
BEGIN NOW Have I played in different countries. END
BEGIN NOW He who plays with old Iagoo END
BEGIN NOW Must have very nimble fingers; END
BEGIN NOW Though you think yourself so skilful, END
BEGIN NOW I can beat you, Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW I can even give you lessons END
BEGIN NOW In your game of Bowl and Counters! END
BEGIN NOW So they sat and played together, END
BEGIN NOW All the old men and the young men, END
BEGIN NOW Played for dresses, weapons, wampum, END
BEGIN NOW Played till midnight, played till morning, END
BEGIN NOW Played until the Yenadizze, END
BEGIN NOW Till the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Of their treasures had despoiled them, END
BEGIN NOW Of the best of all their dresses, END
BEGIN NOW Shirts of deer-skin, robes of ermine, END
BEGIN NOW Belts of wampum, crests of feathers, END
BEGIN NOW Warlike weapons, pipes and pouches. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty eyes glared wildly at him, END
BEGIN NOW Like the eyes of wolves glared at him. END
BEGIN NOW Said the lucky Pau-Puk-Keewis: END
BEGIN NOW In my wigwam I am lonely, END
BEGIN NOW In my wanderings and adventures END
BEGIN NOW I have need of a companion, END
BEGIN NOW Fain would have a Meshinauwa, END
BEGIN NOW An attendant and pipe-bearer. END
BEGIN NOW I will venture all these winnings, END
BEGIN NOW All these garments heaped about me, END
BEGIN NOW All this wampum, all these feathers, END
BEGIN NOW On a single throw will venture END
BEGIN NOW All against the young man yonder! END
BEGIN NOW `T was a youth of sixteen summers, END
BEGIN NOW `T was a nephew of Iagoo; END
BEGIN NOW Face-in-a-Mist, the people called him. END
BEGIN NOW As the fire burns in a pipe-head END
BEGIN NOW Dusky red beneath the ashes, END
BEGIN NOW So beneath his shaggy eyebrows END
BEGIN NOW Glowed the eyes of old Iagoo. END
BEGIN NOW Ugh! he answered very fiercely; END
BEGIN NOW Ugh! they answered all and each one. END
BEGIN NOW Seized the wooden bowl the old man, END
BEGIN NOW Closely in his bony fingers END
BEGIN NOW Clutched the fatal bowl, Onagon, END
BEGIN NOW Shook it fiercely and with fury, END
BEGIN NOW Made the pieces ring together END
BEGIN NOW As he threw them down before him. END
BEGIN NOW Red were both the great Kenabeeks, END
BEGIN NOW Red the Ininewug, the wedge-men, END
BEGIN NOW Red the Sheshebwug, the ducklings, END
BEGIN NOW Black the four brass Ozawabeeks, END
BEGIN NOW White alone the fish, the Keego; END
BEGIN NOW Only five the pieces counted! END
BEGIN NOW Then the smiling Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW Shook the bowl and threw the pieces; END
BEGIN NOW Lightly in the air he tossed them, END
BEGIN NOW And they fell about him scattered; END
BEGIN NOW Dark and bright the Ozawabeeks, END
BEGIN NOW Red and white the other pieces, END
BEGIN NOW And upright among the others END
BEGIN NOW One Ininewug was standing, END
BEGIN NOW Even as crafty Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW Stood alone among the players, END
BEGIN NOW Saying, "Five tens! mine the game is, END
BEGIN NOW Twenty eyes glared at him fiercely, END
BEGIN NOW Like the eyes of wolves glared at him, END
BEGIN NOW As he turned and left the wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW By the nephew of Iagoo, END
BEGIN NOW By the tall and graceful stripling, END
BEGIN NOW Bearing in his arms the winnings, END
BEGIN NOW Shirts of deer-skin, robes of ermine, END
BEGIN NOW Belts of wampum, pipes and weapons. END
BEGIN NOW Carry them," said Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Pointing with his fan of feathers, END
BEGIN NOW To my wigwam far to eastward, END
BEGIN NOW On the dunes of Nagow Wudjoo! END
BEGIN NOW Hot and red with smoke and gambling END
BEGIN NOW Were the eyes of Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW As he came forth to the freshness END
BEGIN NOW Of the pleasant Summer morning. END
BEGIN NOW All the birds were singing gayly, END
BEGIN NOW All the streamlets flowing swiftly, END
BEGIN NOW And the heart of Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW Sang with pleasure as the birds sing, END
BEGIN NOW Beat with triumph like the streamlets, END
BEGIN NOW As he wandered through the village, END
BEGIN NOW In the early gray of morning, END
BEGIN NOW With his fan of turkey-feathers, END
BEGIN NOW With his plumes and tufts of swan's down, END
BEGIN NOW Till he reached the farthest wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW Reached the lodge of Hiawatha. END
BEGIN NOW Silent was it and deserted; END
BEGIN NOW No one met him at the doorway, END
BEGIN NOW No one came to bid him welcome; END
BEGIN NOW But the birds were singing round it, END
BEGIN NOW In and out and round the doorway, END
BEGIN NOW Hopping, singing, fluttering, feeding, END
BEGIN NOW And aloft upon the ridge-pole END
BEGIN NOW Sat with fiery eyes, and, screaming, END
BEGIN NOW Flapped his wings at Pau-Puk-Keewis. END
BEGIN NOW All are gone! the lodge is empty! END
BEGIN NOW Thus it was spake Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW In his heart resolving mischief END
BEGIN NOW Gone is wary Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Gone the silly Laughing Water, END
BEGIN NOW Gone Nokomis, the old woman, END
BEGIN NOW And the lodge is left unguarded! END
BEGIN NOW By the neck he seized the raven, END
BEGIN NOW Whirled it round him like a rattle, END
BEGIN NOW Like a medicine-pouch he shook it, END
BEGIN NOW Strangled Kahgahgee, the raven, END
BEGIN NOW From the ridge-pole of the wigwam END
BEGIN NOW Left its lifeless body hanging, END
BEGIN NOW As an insult to its master, END
BEGIN NOW As a taunt to Hiawatha. END
BEGIN NOW With a stealthy step he entered, END
BEGIN NOW Round the lodge in wild disorder END
BEGIN NOW Threw the household things about him, END
BEGIN NOW Piled together in confusion END
BEGIN NOW Bowls of wood and earthen kettles, END
BEGIN NOW Robes of buffalo and beaver, END
BEGIN NOW Skins of otter, lynx, and ermine, END
BEGIN NOW As an insult to Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW As a taunt to Minnehaha. END
BEGIN NOW Then departed Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Whistling, singing through the forest, END
BEGIN NOW Whistling gayly to the squirrels, END
BEGIN NOW Who from hollow boughs above him END
BEGIN NOW Dropped their acorn-shells upon him, END
BEGIN NOW Singing gayly to the wood birds, END
BEGIN NOW Who from out the leafy darkness END
BEGIN NOW Answered with a song as merry. END
BEGIN NOW Then he climbed the rocky headlands, END
BEGIN NOW Looking o'er the Gitche Gumee, END
BEGIN NOW Perched himself upon their summit, END
BEGIN NOW Waiting full of mirth and mischief END
BEGIN NOW The return of Hiawatha. END
BEGIN NOW Stretched upon his back he lay there; END
BEGIN NOW Far below him splashed the waters, END
BEGIN NOW Plashed and washed the dreamy waters; END
BEGIN NOW Far above him swam the heavens, END
BEGIN NOW Swam the dizzy, dreamy heavens; END
BEGIN NOW Round him hovered, fluttered, rustled END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha's mountain chickens, END
BEGIN NOW Flock-wise swept and wheeled about him, END
BEGIN NOW Almost brushed him with their pinions. END
BEGIN NOW And he killed them as he lay there, END
BEGIN NOW Slaughtered them by tens and twenties, END
BEGIN NOW Threw their bodies down the headland, END
BEGIN NOW Threw them on the beach below him, END
BEGIN NOW Till at length Kayoshk, the sea-gull, END
BEGIN NOW Perched upon a crag above them, END
BEGIN NOW He is slaying us by hundreds! END
BEGIN NOW Send a message to our brother, END
BEGIN NOW Tidings send to Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW Full of wrath was Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW When he came into the village, END
BEGIN NOW Found the people in confusion, END
BEGIN NOW Heard of all the misdemeanors, END
BEGIN NOW All the malice and the mischief, END
BEGIN NOW Of the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis. END
BEGIN NOW Hard his breath came through his nostrils, END
BEGIN NOW Through his teeth he buzzed and muttered END
BEGIN NOW Words of anger and resentment, END
BEGIN NOW Hot and humming, like a hornet. END
BEGIN NOW I will slay this Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Slay this mischief-maker!" said he. END
BEGIN NOW Not so long and wide the world is, END
BEGIN NOW Not so rude and rough the way is, END
BEGIN NOW That my wrath shall not attain him, END
BEGIN NOW That my vengeance shall not reach him! END
BEGIN NOW Then in swift pursuit departed END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha and the hunters END
BEGIN NOW On the trail of Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Through the forest, where he passed it, END
BEGIN NOW To the headlands where he rested; END
BEGIN NOW But they found not Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Only in the trampled grasses, END
BEGIN NOW In the whortleberry-bushes, END
BEGIN NOW Found the couch where he had rested, END
BEGIN NOW Found the impress of his body. END
BEGIN NOW From the lowlands far beneath them, END
BEGIN NOW From the Muskoday, the meadow, END
BEGIN NOW Pau-Puk-Keewis, turning backward, END
BEGIN NOW Made a gesture of defiance, END
BEGIN NOW Made a gesture of derision; END
BEGIN NOW And aloud cried Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW From the summit of the mountains: END
BEGIN NOW Not so long and wide the world is, END
BEGIN NOW Not so rude and rough the way is, END
BEGIN NOW But my wrath shall overtake you, END
BEGIN NOW And my vengeance shall attain you! END
BEGIN NOW Over rock and over river, END
BEGIN NOW Through bush, and brake, and forest, END
BEGIN NOW Ran the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis; END
BEGIN NOW Like an antelope he bounded, END
BEGIN NOW Till he came unto a streamlet END
BEGIN NOW In the middle of the forest, END
BEGIN NOW To a streamlet still and tranquil, END
BEGIN NOW That had overflowed its margin, END
BEGIN NOW To a dam made by the beavers, END
BEGIN NOW To a pond of quiet water, END
BEGIN NOW Where knee-deep the trees were standing, END
BEGIN NOW Where the water lilies floated, END
BEGIN NOW Where the rushes waved and whispered. END
BEGIN NOW On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW On the dam of trunks and branches, END
BEGIN NOW O'er whose summit flowed the streamlet. END
BEGIN NOW From the bottom rose the beaver, END
BEGIN NOW Looked with two great eyes of wonder, END
BEGIN NOW Eyes that seemed to ask a question, END
BEGIN NOW At the stranger, Pau-Puk-Keewis. END
BEGIN NOW On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW O'er his ankles flowed the streamlet, END
BEGIN NOW Flowed the bright and silvery water, END
BEGIN NOW And he spake unto the beaver, END
BEGIN NOW With a smile he spake in this wise: END
BEGIN NOW O my friend Ahmeek, the beaver, END
BEGIN NOW Cool and pleasant is the water; END
BEGIN NOW Let me dive into the water, END
BEGIN NOW Let me rest there in your lodges; END
BEGIN NOW Change me, too, into a beaver! END
BEGIN NOW Cautiously replied the beaver, END
BEGIN NOW With reserve he thus made answer: END
BEGIN NOW Let me first consult the others, END
BEGIN NOW Let me ask the other beavers. END
BEGIN NOW Down he sank into the water, END
BEGIN NOW Heavily sank he, as a stone sinks, END
BEGIN NOW Down among the leaves and branches, END
BEGIN NOW Brown and matted at the bottom. END
BEGIN NOW On the dam stood Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW O'er his ankles flowed the streamlet, END
BEGIN NOW Dashed upon the stones beneath him, END
BEGIN NOW Spread serene and calm before him, END
BEGIN NOW And the sunshine and the shadows END
BEGIN NOW Fell in flecks and gleams upon him, END
BEGIN NOW Fell in little shining patches, END
BEGIN NOW Through the waving, rustling branches. END
BEGIN NOW From the bottom rose the beavers, END
BEGIN NOW Silently above the surface END
BEGIN NOW Rose one head and then another, END
BEGIN NOW Till the pond seemed full of beavers, END
BEGIN NOW Full of black and shining faces. END
BEGIN NOW To the beavers Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW Spake entreating, said in this wise: END
BEGIN NOW Very pleasant is your dwelling, END
BEGIN NOW O my friends! and safe from danger; END
BEGIN NOW Can you not, with all your cunning, END
BEGIN NOW All your wisdom and contrivance, END
BEGIN NOW Change me, too, into a beaver? END
BEGIN NOW Yes! replied Ahmeek, the beaver, END
BEGIN NOW He the King of all the beavers, END
BEGIN NOW Let yourself slide down among us, END
BEGIN NOW Down into the tranquil water. END
BEGIN NOW Down into the pond among them END
BEGIN NOW Silently sank Pau-Puk-Keewis; END
BEGIN NOW Black became his shirt of deer-skin, END
BEGIN NOW Black his moccasins and leggings, END
BEGIN NOW In a broad black tail behind him END
BEGIN NOW Spread his fox-tails and his fringes; END
BEGIN NOW He was changed into a beaver. END
BEGIN NOW Make me large," said Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Make me large and make me larger, END
BEGIN NOW Larger than the other beavers. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, the beaver chief responded, END
BEGIN NOW When our lodge below you enter, END
BEGIN NOW In our wigwam we will make you END
BEGIN NOW Ten times larger than the others. END
BEGIN NOW Thus into the clear, brown water END
BEGIN NOW Silently sank Pau-Puk-Keewis: END
BEGIN NOW Found the bottom covered over END
BEGIN NOW With the trunks of trees and branches, END
BEGIN NOW Hoards of food against the winter, END
BEGIN NOW Piles and heaps against the famine; END
BEGIN NOW Found the lodge with arching doorway, END
BEGIN NOW Leading into spacious chambers. END
BEGIN NOW Here they made him large and larger, END
BEGIN NOW Made him largest of the beavers, END
BEGIN NOW Ten times larger than the others. END
BEGIN NOW You shall be our ruler," said they; END
BEGIN NOW Chief and King of all the beavers. END
BEGIN NOW But not long had Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW Sat in state among the beavers, END
BEGIN NOW When there came a voice, of warning END
BEGIN NOW From the watchman at his station END
BEGIN NOW In the water-flags and lilies, END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha with his hunters! END
BEGIN NOW Then they heard a cry above them, END
BEGIN NOW Heard a shouting and a tramping, END
BEGIN NOW Heard a crashing and a rushing, END
BEGIN NOW And the water round and o'er them END
BEGIN NOW Sank and sucked away in eddies, END
BEGIN NOW And they knew their dam was broken. END
BEGIN NOW On the lodge's roof the hunters END
BEGIN NOW Leaped, and broke it all asunder; END
BEGIN NOW Streamed the sunshine through the crevice, END
BEGIN NOW Sprang the beavers through the doorway, END
BEGIN NOW Hid themselves in deeper water, END
BEGIN NOW In the channel of the streamlet; END
BEGIN NOW But the mighty Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW Could not pass beneath the doorway; END
BEGIN NOW He was puffed with pride and feeding, END
BEGIN NOW He was swollen like a bladder. END
BEGIN NOW Through the roof looked Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Cried aloud, "O Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW Vain are all your craft and cunning, END
BEGIN NOW Vain your manifold disguises! END
BEGIN NOW Well I know you, Pau-Puk-Keewis! END
BEGIN NOW With their clubs they beat and bruised him, END
BEGIN NOW Beat to death poor Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Pounded him as maize is pounded, END
BEGIN NOW Till his skull was crushed to pieces. END
BEGIN NOW Six tall hunters, lithe and limber, END
BEGIN NOW Bore him home on poles and branches, END
BEGIN NOW Bore the body of the beaver; END
BEGIN NOW But the ghost, the Jeebi in him, END
BEGIN NOW Thought and felt as Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Still lived on as Pau-Puk-Keewis. END
BEGIN NOW And it fluttered, strove, and struggled, END
BEGIN NOW Waving hither, waving thither, END
BEGIN NOW As the curtains of a wigwam END
BEGIN NOW Struggle with their thongs of deer-skin, END
BEGIN NOW When the wintry wind is blowing; END
BEGIN NOW Till it drew itself together, END
BEGIN NOW Till it rose up from the body, END
BEGIN NOW Till it took the form and features END
BEGIN NOW Of the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW Vanishing into the forest. END
BEGIN NOW But the wary Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Saw the figure ere it vanished, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the form of Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW Glide into the soft blue shadow END
BEGIN NOW Of the pine-trees of the forest; END
BEGIN NOW Toward the squares of white beyond it, END
BEGIN NOW Toward an opening in the forest. END
BEGIN NOW Like a wind it rushed and panted, END
BEGIN NOW Bending all the boughs before it, END
BEGIN NOW And behind it, as the rain comes, END
BEGIN NOW Came the steps of Hiawatha. END
BEGIN NOW To a lake with many islands END
BEGIN NOW Came the breathless Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Where among the water-lilies END
BEGIN NOW Pishnekuh, the brant, were sailing; END
BEGIN NOW Through the tufts of rushes floating, END
BEGIN NOW Steering through the reedy Islands. END
BEGIN NOW Now their broad black beaks they lifted, END
BEGIN NOW Now they plunged beneath the water, END
BEGIN NOW Now they darkened in the shadow, END
BEGIN NOW Now they brightened in the sunshine. END
BEGIN NOW Pishnekuh! cried Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Pishnekuh! my brothers!" said he, END
BEGIN NOW Change me to a brant with plumage, END
BEGIN NOW With a shining neck and feathers, END
BEGIN NOW Make me large, and make me larger, END
BEGIN NOW Ten times larger than the others. END
BEGIN NOW Straightway to a brant they changed him, END
BEGIN NOW With two huge and dusky pinions, END
BEGIN NOW With a bosom smooth and rounded, END
BEGIN NOW With a bill like two great paddles, END
BEGIN NOW Made him larger than the others, END
BEGIN NOW Ten times larger than the largest, END
BEGIN NOW Just as, shouting from the forest, END
BEGIN NOW On the shore stood Hiawatha. END
BEGIN NOW Up they rose with cry and clamor, END
BEGIN NOW With a whir and beat of pinions, END
BEGIN NOW Rose up from the reedy Islands, END
BEGIN NOW From the water-flags and lilies. END
BEGIN NOW And they said to Pau-Puk-Keewis: END
BEGIN NOW In your flying, look not downward, END
BEGIN NOW Take good heed and look not downward, END
BEGIN NOW Lest some strange mischance should happen, END
BEGIN NOW Lest some great mishap befall you! END
BEGIN NOW Fast and far they fled to northward, END
BEGIN NOW Fast and far through mist and sunshine, END
BEGIN NOW Fed among the moors and fen-lands, END
BEGIN NOW Slept among the reeds and rushes. END
BEGIN NOW On the morrow as they journeyed, END
BEGIN NOW Buoyed and lifted by the South-wind, END
BEGIN NOW Wafted onward by the South-wind, END
BEGIN NOW Blowing fresh and strong behind them, END
BEGIN NOW Rose a sound of human voices, END
BEGIN NOW Rose a clamor from beneath them, END
BEGIN NOW From the lodges of a village, END
BEGIN NOW From the people miles beneath them. END
BEGIN NOW For the people of the village END
BEGIN NOW Saw the flock of brant with wonder, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the wings of Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW Flapping far up in the ether, END
BEGIN NOW Broader than two doorway curtains. END
BEGIN NOW Pau-Puk-Keewis heard the shouting, END
BEGIN NOW Knew the voice of Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Knew the outcry of Iagoo, END
BEGIN NOW And, forgetful of the warning, END
BEGIN NOW Drew his neck in, and looked downward, END
BEGIN NOW And the wind that blew behind him END
BEGIN NOW Caught his mighty fan of feathers, END
BEGIN NOW Sent him wheeling, whirling downward! END
BEGIN NOW All in vain did Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW Struggle to regain his balance! END
BEGIN NOW Whirling round and round and downward, END
BEGIN NOW He beheld in turn the village END
BEGIN NOW And in turn the flock above him, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the village coming nearer, END
BEGIN NOW And the flock receding farther, END
BEGIN NOW Heard the voices growing louder, END
BEGIN NOW Heard the shouting and the laughter; END
BEGIN NOW Saw no more the flocks above him, END
BEGIN NOW Only saw the earth beneath him; END
BEGIN NOW Dead out of the empty heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Dead among the shouting people, END
BEGIN NOW With a heavy sound and sullen, END
BEGIN NOW Fell the brant with broken pinions. END
BEGIN NOW But his soul, his ghost, his shadow, END
BEGIN NOW Still survived as Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Took again the form and features END
BEGIN NOW Of the handsome Yenadizze, END
BEGIN NOW And again went rushing onward, END
BEGIN NOW Followed fast by Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Crying: "Not so wide the world is, END
BEGIN NOW Not so long and rough the way is, END
BEGIN NOW But my wrath shall overtake you, END
BEGIN NOW But my vengeance shall attain you! END
BEGIN NOW And so near he came, so near him, END
BEGIN NOW That his hand was stretched to seize him, END
BEGIN NOW His right hand to seize and hold him, END
BEGIN NOW When the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW Whirled and spun about in circles, END
BEGIN NOW Fanned the air into a whirlwind, END
BEGIN NOW Danced the dust and leaves about him, END
BEGIN NOW And amid the whirling eddies END
BEGIN NOW Sprang into a hollow oak-tree, END
BEGIN NOW Changed himself into a serpent, END
BEGIN NOW Gliding out through root and rubbish. END
BEGIN NOW With his right hand Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Smote amain the hollow oak-tree, END
BEGIN NOW Rent it into shreds and splinters, END
BEGIN NOW Left it lying there in fragments. END
BEGIN NOW But in vain; for Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Once again in human figure, END
BEGIN NOW Full in sight ran on before him, END
BEGIN NOW Sped away in gust and whirlwind, END
BEGIN NOW On the shores of Gitche Gumee, END
BEGIN NOW Came unto the rocky headlands, END
BEGIN NOW To the Pictured Rocks of sandstone, END
BEGIN NOW Looking over lake and landscape. END
BEGIN NOW Opened wide his rocky doorways, END
BEGIN NOW Opened wide his deep abysses, END
BEGIN NOW Giving Pau-Puk-Keewis shelter END
BEGIN NOW In his caverns dark and dreary, END
BEGIN NOW Bidding Pau-Puk-Keewis welcome END
BEGIN NOW To his gloomy lodge of sandstone. END
BEGIN NOW There without stood Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Found the doorways closed against him, END
BEGIN NOW With his mittens, Minjekahwun, END
BEGIN NOW Smote great caverns in the sandstone, END
BEGIN NOW Cried aloud in tones of thunder, END
BEGIN NOW Opened not, and made no answer END
BEGIN NOW From the silent crags of sandstone, END
BEGIN NOW From the gloomy rock abysses. END
BEGIN NOW Then he raised his hands to heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Called imploring on the tempest, END
BEGIN NOW Called Waywassimo, the lightning, END
BEGIN NOW And the thunder, Annemeekee; END
BEGIN NOW And they came with night and darkness, END
BEGIN NOW Sweeping down the Big-Sea-Water END
BEGIN NOW From the distant Thunder Mountains; END
BEGIN NOW And the trembling Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW Heard the footsteps of the thunder, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the red eyes of the lightning, END
BEGIN NOW Was afraid, and crouched and trembled. END
BEGIN NOW Then Waywassimo, the lightning, END
BEGIN NOW Smote the doorways of the caverns, END
BEGIN NOW With his war-club smote the doorways, END
BEGIN NOW Smote the jutting crags of sandstone, END
BEGIN NOW And the thunder, Annemeekee, END
BEGIN NOW Shouted down into the caverns, END
BEGIN NOW And the crags fell, and beneath them END
BEGIN NOW Dead among the rocky ruins END
BEGIN NOW Lay the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Lay the handsome Yenadizze, END
BEGIN NOW Slain in his own human figure. END
BEGIN NOW Ended were his wild adventures, END
BEGIN NOW Ended were his tricks and gambols, END
BEGIN NOW Ended all his craft and cunning, END
BEGIN NOW Ended all his mischief-making, END
BEGIN NOW All his gambling and his dancing, END
BEGIN NOW All his wooing of the maidens. END
BEGIN NOW Then the noble Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Took his soul, his ghost, his shadow, END
BEGIN NOW Spake and said: "O Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW Never more in human figure END
BEGIN NOW Shall you search for new adventures; END
BEGIN NOW Never more with jest and laughter END
BEGIN NOW Dance the dust and leaves in whirlwinds; END
BEGIN NOW But above there in the heavens END
BEGIN NOW You shall soar and sail in circles; END
BEGIN NOW I will change you to an eagle, END
BEGIN NOW To Keneu, the great war-eagle, END
BEGIN NOW Chief of all the fowls with feathers, END
BEGIN NOW Chief of Hiawatha's chickens. END
BEGIN NOW And the name of Pau-Puk-Keewis END
BEGIN NOW Lingers still among the people, END
BEGIN NOW Lingers still among the singers, END
BEGIN NOW And among the story-tellers; END
BEGIN NOW And in Winter, when the snow-flakes END
BEGIN NOW Whirl in eddies round the lodges, END
BEGIN NOW When the wind in gusty tumult END
BEGIN NOW O'er the smoke-flue pipes and whistles, END
BEGIN NOW There, they cry, "comes Pau-Puk-Keewis, END
BEGIN NOW He is dancing through the village, END
BEGIN NOW He is gathering in his harvest! END
BEGIN NOW Far and wide among the nations END
BEGIN NOW Spread the name and fame of Kwasind; END
BEGIN NOW No man dared to strive with Kwasind, END
BEGIN NOW No man could compete with Kwasind. END
BEGIN NOW But the mischievous Puk-Wudjies, END
BEGIN NOW They the envious Little People, END
BEGIN NOW They the fairies and the pygmies, END
BEGIN NOW Plotted and conspired against him. END
BEGIN NOW If this hateful Kwasind," said they, END
BEGIN NOW If this great, outrageous fellow END
BEGIN NOW Goes on thus a little longer, END
BEGIN NOW Tearing everything he touches, END
BEGIN NOW Rending everything to pieces, END
BEGIN NOW Filling all the world with wonder, END
BEGIN NOW What becomes of the Puk-Wudjies? END
BEGIN NOW Who will care for the Puk-Wudjies? END
BEGIN NOW He will tread us down like mushrooms, END
BEGIN NOW Drive us all into the water, END
BEGIN NOW Give our bodies to be eaten END
BEGIN NOW By the wicked Nee-ba-naw-baigs, END
BEGIN NOW By the Spirits of the water! END
BEGIN NOW So the angry Little People END
BEGIN NOW All conspired against the Strong Man, END
BEGIN NOW All conspired to murder Kwasind, END
BEGIN NOW Yes, to rid the world of Kwasind, END
BEGIN NOW The audacious, overbearing, END
BEGIN NOW Heartless, haughty, dangerous Kwasind! END
BEGIN NOW Now this wondrous strength of Kwasind END
BEGIN NOW In his crown alone was seated; END
BEGIN NOW In his crown too was his weakness; END
BEGIN NOW There alone could he be wounded, END
BEGIN NOW Nowhere else could weapon pierce him, END
BEGIN NOW Nowhere else could weapon harm him. END
BEGIN NOW Even there the only weapon END
BEGIN NOW That could wound him, that could slay him, END
BEGIN NOW Was the seed-cone of the pine-tree, END
BEGIN NOW Was the blue cone of the fir-tree. END
BEGIN NOW This was Kwasind's fatal secret, END
BEGIN NOW Known to no man among mortals; END
BEGIN NOW But the cunning Little People, END
BEGIN NOW The Puk-Wudjies, knew the secret, END
BEGIN NOW Knew the only way to kill him. END
BEGIN NOW So they gathered cones together, END
BEGIN NOW Gathered seed-cones of the pine-tree, END
BEGIN NOW Gathered blue cones of the fir-tree, END
BEGIN NOW In the woods by Taquamenaw, END
BEGIN NOW Brought them to the river's margin, END
BEGIN NOW Heaped them in great piles together, END
BEGIN NOW Where the red rocks from the margin END
BEGIN NOW Jutting overhang the river. END
BEGIN NOW There they lay in wait for Kwasind, END
BEGIN NOW The malicious Little People. END
BEGIN NOW `T was an afternoon in Summer; END
BEGIN NOW Very hot and still the air was, END
BEGIN NOW Very smooth the gliding river, END
BEGIN NOW Motionless the sleeping shadows: END
BEGIN NOW Insects glistened in the sunshine, END
BEGIN NOW Insects skated on the water, END
BEGIN NOW Filled the drowsy air with buzzing, END
BEGIN NOW With a far resounding war-cry. END
BEGIN NOW Down the river came the Strong Man, END
BEGIN NOW In his birch canoe came Kwasind, END
BEGIN NOW Floating slowly down the current END
BEGIN NOW Of the sluggish Taquamenaw, END
BEGIN NOW Very languid with the weather, END
BEGIN NOW Very sleepy with the silence. END
BEGIN NOW From the overhanging branches, END
BEGIN NOW From the tassels of the birch-trees, END
BEGIN NOW Soft the Spirit of Sleep descended; END
BEGIN NOW By his airy hosts surrounded, END
BEGIN NOW His invisible attendants, END
BEGIN NOW Like a burnished Dush-kwo-ne-she, END
BEGIN NOW Like a dragon-fly, he hovered END
BEGIN NOW O'er the drowsy head of Kwasind. END
BEGIN NOW To his ear there came a murmur END
BEGIN NOW As of waves upon a sea-shore, END
BEGIN NOW As of far-off tumbling waters, END
BEGIN NOW As of winds among the pine-trees; END
BEGIN NOW And he felt upon his forehead END
BEGIN NOW Blows of little airy war-clubs, END
BEGIN NOW Wielded by the slumbrous legions END
BEGIN NOW As of some one breathing on him. END
BEGIN NOW At the first blow of their war-clubs, END
BEGIN NOW Fell a drowsiness on Kwasind; END
BEGIN NOW At the second blow they smote him, END
BEGIN NOW Motionless his paddle rested; END
BEGIN NOW At the third, before his vision END
BEGIN NOW Reeled the landscape Into darkness, END
BEGIN NOW Very sound asleep was Kwasind. END
BEGIN NOW So he floated down the river, END
BEGIN NOW Like a blind man seated upright, END
BEGIN NOW Floated down the Taquamenaw, END
BEGIN NOW Underneath the trembling birch-trees, END
BEGIN NOW Underneath the wooded headlands, END
BEGIN NOW Underneath the war encampment END
BEGIN NOW Of the pygmies, the Puk-Wudjies. END
BEGIN NOW There they stood, all armed and waiting, END
BEGIN NOW Hurled the pine-cones down upon him, END
BEGIN NOW Struck him on his brawny shoulders, END
BEGIN NOW On his crown defenceless struck him. END
BEGIN NOW Death to Kwasind!" was the sudden END
BEGIN NOW War-cry of the Little People. END
BEGIN NOW And he sideways swayed and tumbled, END
BEGIN NOW Sideways fell into the river, END
BEGIN NOW Plunged beneath the sluggish water END
BEGIN NOW Headlong, as an otter plunges; END
BEGIN NOW And the birch canoe, abandoned, END
BEGIN NOW Drifted empty down the river, END
BEGIN NOW Bottom upward swerved and drifted: END
BEGIN NOW Nothing more was seen of Kwasind. END
BEGIN NOW But the memory of the Strong Man END
BEGIN NOW Lingered long among the people, END
BEGIN NOW And whenever through the forest END
BEGIN NOW Raged and roared the wintry tempest, END
BEGIN NOW And the branches, tossed and troubled, END
BEGIN NOW Creaked and groaned and split asunder, END
BEGIN NOW Kwasind! cried they; "that is Kwasind! END
BEGIN NOW He is gathering in his fire-wood! END
BEGIN NOW Never stoops the soaring vulture END
BEGIN NOW On his quarry in the desert, END
BEGIN NOW On the sick or wounded bison, END
BEGIN NOW But another vulture, watching END
BEGIN NOW From his high aerial look-out, END
BEGIN NOW Sees the downward plunge, and follows; END
BEGIN NOW And a third pursues the second, END
BEGIN NOW Coming from the invisible ether, END
BEGIN NOW First a speck, and then a vulture, END
BEGIN NOW Till the air is dark with pinions. END
BEGIN NOW So disasters come not singly; END
BEGIN NOW But as if they watched and waited, END
BEGIN NOW Scanning one another's motions, END
BEGIN NOW When the first descends, the others END
BEGIN NOW Follow, follow, gathering flock-wise END
BEGIN NOW Round their victim, sick and wounded, END
BEGIN NOW First a shadow, then a sorrow, END
BEGIN NOW Till the air is dark with anguish. END
BEGIN NOW Now, o'er all the dreary North-land, END
BEGIN NOW Breathing on the lakes and rivers, END
BEGIN NOW Into stone had changed their waters. END
BEGIN NOW From his hair he shook the snow-flakes, END
BEGIN NOW Till the plains were strewn with whiteness, END
BEGIN NOW One uninterrupted level, END
BEGIN NOW As if, stooping, the Creator END
BEGIN NOW With his hand had smoothed them over. END
BEGIN NOW Through the forest, wide and wailing, END
BEGIN NOW Roamed the hunter on his snow-shoes; END
BEGIN NOW In the village worked the women, END
BEGIN NOW Pounded maize, or dressed the deer-skin; END
BEGIN NOW And the young men played together END
BEGIN NOW On the ice the noisy ball-play, END
BEGIN NOW On the plain the dance of snow-shoes. END
BEGIN NOW One dark evening, after sundown, END
BEGIN NOW In her wigwam Laughing Water END
BEGIN NOW Sat with old Nokomis, waiting END
BEGIN NOW For the steps of Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Homeward from the hunt returning. END
BEGIN NOW On their faces gleamed the firelight, END
BEGIN NOW Painting them with streaks of crimson, END
BEGIN NOW In the eyes of old Nokomis END
BEGIN NOW Glimmered like the watery moonlight, END
BEGIN NOW In the eyes of Laughing Water END
BEGIN NOW Glistened like the sun in water; END
BEGIN NOW And behind them crouched their shadows END
BEGIN NOW In the corners of the wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW And the smoke in wreaths above them END
BEGIN NOW Climbed and crowded through the smoke-flue. END
BEGIN NOW Then the curtain of the doorway END
BEGIN NOW From without was slowly lifted; END
BEGIN NOW Brighter glowed the fire a moment, END
BEGIN NOW And a moment swerved the smoke-wreath, END
BEGIN NOW As two women entered softly, END
BEGIN NOW Passed the doorway uninvited, END
BEGIN NOW Without word of salutation, END
BEGIN NOW Without sign of recognition, END
BEGIN NOW Sat down in the farthest corner, END
BEGIN NOW Crouching low among the shadows. END
BEGIN NOW From their aspect and their garments, END
BEGIN NOW Strangers seemed they in the village; END
BEGIN NOW Very pale and haggard were they, END
BEGIN NOW As they sat there sad and silent, END
BEGIN NOW Trembling, cowering with the shadows. END
BEGIN NOW Was it the wind above the smoke-flue, END
BEGIN NOW Muttering down into the wigwam? END
BEGIN NOW Was it the owl, the Koko-koho, END
BEGIN NOW Hooting from the dismal forest? END
BEGIN NOW Sure a voice said in the silence: END
BEGIN NOW These are corpses clad in garments, END
BEGIN NOW These are ghosts that come to haunt you, END
BEGIN NOW From the kingdom of Ponemah, END
BEGIN NOW From the land of the Hereafter! END
BEGIN NOW Homeward now came Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW From his hunting in the forest, END
BEGIN NOW With the snow upon his tresses, END
BEGIN NOW And the red deer on his shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW At the feet of Laughing Water END
BEGIN NOW Down he threw his lifeless burden; END
BEGIN NOW Nobler, handsomer she thought him, END
BEGIN NOW Than when first he came to woo her, END
BEGIN NOW First threw down the deer before her, END
BEGIN NOW As a token of his wishes, END
BEGIN NOW As a promise of the future. END
BEGIN NOW Then he turned and saw the strangers, END
BEGIN NOW Cowering, crouching with the shadows; END
BEGIN NOW Said within himself, "Who are they? END
BEGIN NOW What strange guests has Minnehaha? END
BEGIN NOW But he questioned not the strangers, END
BEGIN NOW Only spake to bid them welcome END
BEGIN NOW To his lodge, his food, his fireside. END
BEGIN NOW When the evening meal was ready, END
BEGIN NOW And the deer had been divided, END
BEGIN NOW Both the pallid guests, the strangers, END
BEGIN NOW Springing from among the shadows, END
BEGIN NOW Seized upon the choicest portions, END
BEGIN NOW Seized the white fat of the roebuck, END
BEGIN NOW Set apart for Laughing Water, END
BEGIN NOW For the wife of Hiawatha; END
BEGIN NOW Without asking, without thanking, END
BEGIN NOW Eagerly devoured the morsels, END
BEGIN NOW Flitted back among the shadows END
BEGIN NOW In the corner of the wigwam. END
BEGIN NOW Not a word spake Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Not a motion made Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW Not a gesture Laughing Water; END
BEGIN NOW Not a change came o'er their features; END
BEGIN NOW Only Minnehaha softly END
BEGIN NOW Whispered, saying, "They are famished; END
BEGIN NOW Let them do what best delights them; END
BEGIN NOW Let them eat, for they are famished. END
BEGIN NOW Many a daylight dawned and darkened, END
BEGIN NOW Many a night shook off the daylight END
BEGIN NOW As the pine shakes off the snow-flakes END
BEGIN NOW From the midnight of its branches; END
BEGIN NOW Day by day the guests unmoving END
BEGIN NOW Sat there silent in the wigwam; END
BEGIN NOW But by night, in storm or starlight, END
BEGIN NOW Forth they went into the forest, END
BEGIN NOW Bringing fire-wood to the wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW Bringing pine-cones for the burning, END
BEGIN NOW Always sad and always silent. END
BEGIN NOW And whenever Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Came from fishing or from hunting, END
BEGIN NOW When the evening meal was ready, END
BEGIN NOW And the food had been divided, END
BEGIN NOW Gliding from their darksome corner, END
BEGIN NOW Came the pallid guests, the strangers, END
BEGIN NOW Seized upon the choicest portions END
BEGIN NOW Set aside for Laughing Water, END
BEGIN NOW And without rebuke or question END
BEGIN NOW Flitted back among the shadows. END
BEGIN NOW Never once had Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW By a word or look reproved them; END
BEGIN NOW Never once had old Nokomis END
BEGIN NOW Made a gesture of impatience; END
BEGIN NOW Never once had Laughing Water END
BEGIN NOW Shown resentment at the outrage. END
BEGIN NOW All had they endured in silence, END
BEGIN NOW That the rights of guest and stranger, END
BEGIN NOW That the virtue of free-giving, END
BEGIN NOW By a look might not be lessened, END
BEGIN NOW By a word might not be broken. END
BEGIN NOW Once at midnight Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Ever wakeful, ever watchful, END
BEGIN NOW In the wigwam, dimly lighted END
BEGIN NOW By the brands that still were burning, END
BEGIN NOW By the glimmering, flickering firelight END
BEGIN NOW Heard a sighing, oft repeated, END
BEGIN NOW From his couch rose Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW From his shaggy hides of bison, END
BEGIN NOW Pushed aside the deer-skin curtain, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the pallid guests, the shadows, END
BEGIN NOW Sitting upright on their couches, END
BEGIN NOW Weeping in the silent midnight. END
BEGIN NOW And he said: "O guests! why is it END
BEGIN NOW That your hearts are so afflicted, END
BEGIN NOW That you sob so in the midnight? END
BEGIN NOW Has perchance the old Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW Has my wife, my Minnehaha, END
BEGIN NOW Wronged or grieved you by unkindness, END
BEGIN NOW Failed in hospitable duties? END
BEGIN NOW Then the shadows ceased from weeping, END
BEGIN NOW Ceased from sobbing and lamenting, END
BEGIN NOW And they said, with gentle voices: END
BEGIN NOW We are ghosts of the departed, END
BEGIN NOW Souls of those who once were with you. END
BEGIN NOW From the realms of Chibiabos END
BEGIN NOW Hither have we come to try you, END
BEGIN NOW Hither have we come to warn you. END
BEGIN NOW Cries of grief and lamentation END
BEGIN NOW Cries of anguish from the living, END
BEGIN NOW Calling back their friends departed, END
BEGIN NOW Sadden us with useless sorrow. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore have we come to try you; END
BEGIN NOW No one knows us, no one heeds us. END
BEGIN NOW We are but a burden to you, END
BEGIN NOW And we see that the departed END
BEGIN NOW Have no place among the living. END
BEGIN NOW Think of this, O Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW Speak of it to all the people, END
BEGIN NOW That henceforward and forever END
BEGIN NOW They no more with lamentations END
BEGIN NOW Sadden the souls of the departed END
BEGIN NOW Do not lay such heavy burdens END
BEGIN NOW In the graves of those you bury, END
BEGIN NOW Not such weight of furs and wampum, END
BEGIN NOW Not such weight of pots and kettles, END
BEGIN NOW For the spirits faint beneath them. END
BEGIN NOW Only give them food to carry, END
BEGIN NOW Only give them fire to light them. END
BEGIN NOW Four days is the spirit's journey END
BEGIN NOW To the land of ghosts and shadows, END
BEGIN NOW Four its lonely night encampments; END
BEGIN NOW Four times must their fires be lighted. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore, when the dead are buried, END
BEGIN NOW Let a fire, as night approaches, END
BEGIN NOW Four times on the grave be kindled, END
BEGIN NOW That the soul upon its journey END
BEGIN NOW May not lack the cheerful firelight, END
BEGIN NOW May not grope about in darkness. END
BEGIN NOW Farewell, noble Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW We have put you to the trial, END
BEGIN NOW To the proof have put your patience, END
BEGIN NOW By the insult of our presence, END
BEGIN NOW By the outrage of our actions. END
BEGIN NOW We have found you great and noble. END
BEGIN NOW Fail not in the greater trial, END
BEGIN NOW Faint not in the harder struggle. END
BEGIN NOW When they ceased, a sudden darkness END
BEGIN NOW Fell and filled the silent wigwam. END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha heard a rustle END
BEGIN NOW As of garments trailing by him, END
BEGIN NOW Heard the curtain of the doorway END
BEGIN NOW Lifted by a hand he saw not, END
BEGIN NOW Felt the cold breath of the night air, END
BEGIN NOW For a moment saw the starlight; END
BEGIN NOW But he saw the ghosts no longer, END
BEGIN NOW Saw no more the wandering spirits END
BEGIN NOW From the kingdom of Ponemah, END
BEGIN NOW From the land of the Hereafter. END
BEGIN NOW Oh the long and dreary Winter! END
BEGIN NOW Oh the cold and cruel Winter! END
BEGIN NOW Ever thicker, thicker, thicker END
BEGIN NOW Froze the ice on lake and river, END
BEGIN NOW Ever deeper, deeper, deeper END
BEGIN NOW Fell the snow o'er all the landscape, END
BEGIN NOW Fell the covering snow, and drifted END
BEGIN NOW Through the forest, round the village. END
BEGIN NOW Hardly from his buried wigwam END
BEGIN NOW Could the hunter force a passage; END
BEGIN NOW With his mittens and his snow-shoes END
BEGIN NOW Vainly walked he through the forest, END
BEGIN NOW Sought for bird or beast and found none, END
BEGIN NOW Saw no track of deer or rabbit, END
BEGIN NOW In the snow beheld no footprints, END
BEGIN NOW In the ghastly, gleaming forest END
BEGIN NOW Fell, and could not rise from weakness, END
BEGIN NOW Perished there from cold and hunger. END
BEGIN NOW Oh the famine and the fever! END
BEGIN NOW Oh the wasting of the famine! END
BEGIN NOW Oh the blasting of the fever! END
BEGIN NOW Oh the wailing of the children! END
BEGIN NOW Oh the anguish of the women! END
BEGIN NOW All the earth was sick and famished; END
BEGIN NOW Hungry was the air around them, END
BEGIN NOW Hungry was the sky above them, END
BEGIN NOW And the hungry stars in heaven END
BEGIN NOW Like the eyes of wolves glared at them! END
BEGIN NOW Into Hiawatha's wigwam END
BEGIN NOW Came two other guests, as silent END
BEGIN NOW As the ghosts were, and as gloomy, END
BEGIN NOW Waited not to be invited END
BEGIN NOW Did not parley at the doorway END
BEGIN NOW Sat there without word of welcome END
BEGIN NOW In the seat of Laughing Water; END
BEGIN NOW Looked with haggard eyes and hollow END
BEGIN NOW At the face of Laughing Water. END
BEGIN NOW And the foremost said: "Behold me! END
BEGIN NOW And the other said: "Behold me! END
BEGIN NOW And the lovely Minnehaha END
BEGIN NOW Shuddered as they looked upon her, END
BEGIN NOW Shuddered at the words they uttered, END
BEGIN NOW Lay down on her bed in silence, END
BEGIN NOW Hid her face, but made no answer; END
BEGIN NOW Lay there trembling, freezing, burning END
BEGIN NOW At the looks they cast upon her, END
BEGIN NOW At the fearful words they uttered. END
BEGIN NOW Forth into the empty forest END
BEGIN NOW Rushed the maddened Hiawatha; END
BEGIN NOW In his heart was deadly sorrow, END
BEGIN NOW In his face a stony firmness; END
BEGIN NOW On his brow the sweat of anguish END
BEGIN NOW Started, but it froze and fell not. END
BEGIN NOW Wrapped in furs and armed for hunting, END
BEGIN NOW With his mighty bow of ash-tree, END
BEGIN NOW With his quiver full of arrows, END
BEGIN NOW With his mittens, Minjekahwun, END
BEGIN NOW Into the vast and vacant forest END
BEGIN NOW On his snow-shoes strode he forward. END
BEGIN NOW Cried he with his face uplifted END
BEGIN NOW In that bitter hour of anguish, END
BEGIN NOW Give your children food, O father! END
BEGIN NOW Give us food, or we must perish! END
BEGIN NOW Give me food for Minnehaha, END
BEGIN NOW For my dying Minnehaha! END
BEGIN NOW Through the far-resounding forest, END
BEGIN NOW Through the forest vast and vacant END
BEGIN NOW Rang that cry of desolation, END
BEGIN NOW But there came no other answer END
BEGIN NOW Than the echo of his crying, END
BEGIN NOW Than the echo of the woodlands, END
BEGIN NOW All day long roved Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW In that melancholy forest, END
BEGIN NOW Through the shadow of whose thickets, END
BEGIN NOW In the pleasant days of Summer, END
BEGIN NOW Of that ne'er forgotten Summer, END
BEGIN NOW He had brought his young wife homeward END
BEGIN NOW From the land of the Dacotahs; END
BEGIN NOW When the birds sang in the thickets, END
BEGIN NOW And the streamlets laughed and glistened, END
BEGIN NOW And the air was full of fragrance, END
BEGIN NOW And the lovely Laughing Water END
BEGIN NOW Said with voice that did not tremble, END
BEGIN NOW I will follow you, my husband! END
BEGIN NOW In the wigwam with Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW With those gloomy guests that watched her, END
BEGIN NOW She was lying, the Beloved, END
BEGIN NOW She, the dying Minnehaha. END
BEGIN NOW Hark! she said; "I hear a rushing, END
BEGIN NOW Hear a roaring and a rushing, END
BEGIN NOW Calling to me from a distance! END
BEGIN NOW No, my child!" said old Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW `T is the night-wind in the pine-trees! END
BEGIN NOW Look! she said; "I see my father END
BEGIN NOW Standing lonely at his doorway, END
BEGIN NOW Beckoning to me from his wigwam END
BEGIN NOW In the land of the Dacotahs! END
BEGIN NOW No, my child!" said old Nokomis. END
BEGIN NOW `T is the smoke, that waves and beckons! END
BEGIN NOW Ah! said she, "the eyes of Pauguk END
BEGIN NOW Glare upon me in the darkness, END
BEGIN NOW I can feel his icy fingers END
BEGIN NOW Clasping mine amid the darkness! END
BEGIN NOW And the desolate Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Far away amid the forest, END
BEGIN NOW Miles away among the mountains, END
BEGIN NOW Heard that sudden cry of anguish, END
BEGIN NOW Heard the voice of Minnehaha END
BEGIN NOW Calling to him in the darkness, END
BEGIN NOW Over snow-fields waste and pathless, END
BEGIN NOW Under snow-encumbered branches, END
BEGIN NOW Homeward hurried Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Empty-handed, heavy-hearted, END
BEGIN NOW Heard Nokomis moaning, wailing: END
BEGIN NOW Would that I had perished for you, END
BEGIN NOW Would that I were dead as you are! END
BEGIN NOW And he rushed into the wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the old Nokomis slowly END
BEGIN NOW Rocking to and fro and moaning, END
BEGIN NOW Saw his lovely Minnehaha END
BEGIN NOW Lying dead and cold before him, END
BEGIN NOW And his bursting heart within him END
BEGIN NOW Uttered such a cry of anguish, END
BEGIN NOW That the forest moaned and shuddered, END
BEGIN NOW That the very stars in heaven END
BEGIN NOW Shook and trembled with his anguish. END
BEGIN NOW Then he sat down, still and speechless, END
BEGIN NOW At the feet of Laughing Water, END
BEGIN NOW At those willing feet, that never END
BEGIN NOW More would lightly run to meet him, END
BEGIN NOW Never more would lightly follow. END
BEGIN NOW With both hands his face he covered, END
BEGIN NOW Seven long days and nights he sat there, END
BEGIN NOW As if in a swoon he sat there, END
BEGIN NOW Speechless, motionless, unconscious END
BEGIN NOW Of the daylight or the darkness. END
BEGIN NOW Then they buried Minnehaha; END
BEGIN NOW In the snow a grave they made her END
BEGIN NOW In the forest deep and darksome END
BEGIN NOW Underneath the moaning hemlocks; END
BEGIN NOW Clothed her in her richest garments END
BEGIN NOW Wrapped her in her robes of ermine, END
BEGIN NOW Covered her with snow, like ermine; END
BEGIN NOW Thus they buried Minnehaha. END
BEGIN NOW And at night a fire was lighted, END
BEGIN NOW On her grave four times was kindled, END
BEGIN NOW For her soul upon its journey END
BEGIN NOW From his doorway Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Saw it burning in the forest, END
BEGIN NOW Lighting up the gloomy hemlocks; END
BEGIN NOW From his sleepless bed uprising, END
BEGIN NOW Stood and watched it at the doorway, END
BEGIN NOW That it might not be extinguished, END
BEGIN NOW Might not leave her in the darkness. END
BEGIN NOW Farewell! said he, Minnehaha! END
BEGIN NOW All my heart is buried with you, END
BEGIN NOW All my thoughts go onward with you! END
BEGIN NOW Come not back again to labor, END
BEGIN NOW Come not back again to suffer, END
BEGIN NOW Wear the heart and waste the body. END
BEGIN NOW Soon my task will be completed, END
BEGIN NOW Soon your footsteps I shall follow END
BEGIN NOW The White Man's Foot END
BEGIN NOW In his lodge beside a river, END
BEGIN NOW Close beside a frozen river, END
BEGIN NOW Sat an old man, sad and lonely. END
BEGIN NOW White his hair was as a snow-drift; END
BEGIN NOW Dull and low his fire was burning, END
BEGIN NOW And the old man shook and trembled, END
BEGIN NOW In his tattered white-skin-wrapper, END
BEGIN NOW Hearing nothing but the tempest END
BEGIN NOW As it roared along the forest, END
BEGIN NOW Seeing nothing but the snow-storm, END
BEGIN NOW As it whirled and hissed and drifted. END
BEGIN NOW All the coals were white with ashes, END
BEGIN NOW And the fire was slowly dying, END
BEGIN NOW As a young man, walking lightly, END
BEGIN NOW At the open doorway entered. END
BEGIN NOW Red with blood of youth his cheeks were, END
BEGIN NOW Soft his eyes, as stars in Spring-time, END
BEGIN NOW Bound his forehead was with grasses; END
BEGIN NOW Bound and plumed with scented grasses, END
BEGIN NOW On his lips a smile of beauty, END
BEGIN NOW Filling all the lodge with sunshine, END
BEGIN NOW In his hand a bunch of blossoms END
BEGIN NOW Filling all the lodge with sweetness. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, my son!" exclaimed the old man, END
BEGIN NOW Happy are my eyes to see you. END
BEGIN NOW Sit here on the mat beside me, END
BEGIN NOW Sit here by the dying embers, END
BEGIN NOW Let us pass the night together, END
BEGIN NOW Tell me of your strange adventures, END
BEGIN NOW Of the lands where you have travelled; END
BEGIN NOW I will tell you of my prowess, END
BEGIN NOW Of my many deeds of wonder. END
BEGIN NOW From his pouch he drew his peace-pipe, END
BEGIN NOW Very old and strangely fashioned; END
BEGIN NOW Made of red stone was the pipe-head, END
BEGIN NOW And the stem a reed with feathers; END
BEGIN NOW Filled the pipe with bark of willow, END
BEGIN NOW Placed a burning coal upon it, END
BEGIN NOW Gave it to his guest, the stranger, END
BEGIN NOW And began to speak in this wise: END
BEGIN NOW When I blow my breath about me, END
BEGIN NOW When I breathe upon the landscape, END
BEGIN NOW Motionless are all the rivers, END
BEGIN NOW Hard as stone becomes the water! END
BEGIN NOW And the young man answered, smiling: END
BEGIN NOW When I blow my breath about me, END
BEGIN NOW When I breathe upon the landscape, END
BEGIN NOW Flowers spring up o'er all the meadows, END
BEGIN NOW Singing, onward rush the rivers! END
BEGIN NOW When I shake my hoary tresses, END
BEGIN NOW Said the old man darkly frowning, END
BEGIN NOW All the land with snow is covered; END
BEGIN NOW All the leaves from all the branches END
BEGIN NOW Fall and fade and die and wither, END
BEGIN NOW For I breathe, and lo! they are not. END
BEGIN NOW From the waters and the marshes, END
BEGIN NOW Rise the wild goose and the heron, END
BEGIN NOW Fly away to distant regions, END
BEGIN NOW For I speak, and lo! they are not. END
BEGIN NOW And where'er my footsteps wander, END
BEGIN NOW All the wild beasts of the forest END
BEGIN NOW Hide themselves in holes and caverns, END
BEGIN NOW And the earth becomes as flintstone! END
BEGIN NOW When I shake my flowing ringlets, END
BEGIN NOW Said the young man, softly laughing, END
BEGIN NOW Showers of rain fall warm and welcome, END
BEGIN NOW Plants lift up their heads rejoicing, END
BEGIN NOW Back unto their lakes and marshes END
BEGIN NOW Come the wild goose and the heron, END
BEGIN NOW Homeward shoots the arrowy swallow, END
BEGIN NOW Sing the bluebird and the robin, END
BEGIN NOW And where'er my footsteps wander, END
BEGIN NOW All the meadows wave with blossoms, END
BEGIN NOW All the woodlands ring with music, END
BEGIN NOW All the trees are dark with foliage! END
BEGIN NOW While they spake, the night departed: END
BEGIN NOW From the distant realms of Wabun, END
BEGIN NOW From his shining lodge of silver, END
BEGIN NOW Like a warrior robed and painted, END
BEGIN NOW Came the sun, and said, "Behold me END
BEGIN NOW Gheezis, the great sun, behold me! END
BEGIN NOW Then the old man's tongue was speechless END
BEGIN NOW And the air grew warm and pleasant, END
BEGIN NOW And upon the wigwam sweetly END
BEGIN NOW Sang the bluebird and the robin, END
BEGIN NOW And the stream began to murmur, END
BEGIN NOW And a scent of growing grasses END
BEGIN NOW Through the lodge was gently wafted. END
BEGIN NOW And Segwun, the youthful stranger, END
BEGIN NOW More distinctly in the daylight END
BEGIN NOW Saw the icy face before him; END
BEGIN NOW From his eyes the tears were flowing, END
BEGIN NOW As from melting lakes the streamlets, END
BEGIN NOW And his body shrunk and dwindled END
BEGIN NOW As the shouting sun ascended, END
BEGIN NOW Till into the air it faded, END
BEGIN NOW Till into the ground it vanished, END
BEGIN NOW And the young man saw before him, END
BEGIN NOW On the hearth-stone of the wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW Where the fire had smoked and smouldered, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the earliest flower of Spring-time, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the Beauty of the Spring-time, END
BEGIN NOW Saw the Miskodeed in blossom. END
BEGIN NOW Thus it was that in the North-land END
BEGIN NOW After that unheard-of coldness, END
BEGIN NOW That intolerable Winter, END
BEGIN NOW Came the Spring with all its splendor, END
BEGIN NOW All its birds and all its blossoms, END
BEGIN NOW All its flowers and leaves and grasses. END
BEGIN NOW Sailing on the wind to northward, END
BEGIN NOW Flying in great flocks, like arrows, END
BEGIN NOW Like huge arrows shot through heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Passed the swan, the Mahnahbezee, END
BEGIN NOW Speaking almost as a man speaks; END
BEGIN NOW And in long lines waving, bending END
BEGIN NOW Like a bow-string snapped asunder, END
BEGIN NOW Came the white goose, Waw-be-wawa; END
BEGIN NOW And in pairs, or singly flying, END
BEGIN NOW Mahng the loon, with clangorous pinions, END
BEGIN NOW The blue heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah, END
BEGIN NOW And the grouse, the Mushkodasa. END
BEGIN NOW In the thickets and the meadows END
BEGIN NOW Piped the bluebird, the Owaissa, END
BEGIN NOW On the summit of the lodges END
BEGIN NOW Sang the robin, the Opechee, END
BEGIN NOW In the covert of the pine-trees END
BEGIN NOW Cooed the pigeon, the Omemee; END
BEGIN NOW And the sorrowing Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Speechless in his infinite sorrow, END
BEGIN NOW Heard their voices calling to him, END
BEGIN NOW Went forth from his gloomy doorway, END
BEGIN NOW Stood and gazed into the heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Gazed upon the earth and waters. END
BEGIN NOW From his wanderings far to eastward, END
BEGIN NOW From the regions of the morning, END
BEGIN NOW From the shining land of Wabun, END
BEGIN NOW Homeward now returned Iagoo, END
BEGIN NOW The great traveller, the great boaster, END
BEGIN NOW Full of new and strange adventures, END
BEGIN NOW Marvels many and many wonders. END
BEGIN NOW And the people of the village END
BEGIN NOW Listened to him as he told them END
BEGIN NOW Of his marvellous adventures, END
BEGIN NOW Laughing answered him in this wise: END
BEGIN NOW Ugh! it is indeed Iagoo! END
BEGIN NOW No one else beholds such wonders! END
BEGIN NOW He had seen, he said, a water END
BEGIN NOW Bigger than the Big-Sea-Water, END
BEGIN NOW Broader than the Gitche Gumee, END
BEGIN NOW Bitter so that none could drink it! END
BEGIN NOW At each other looked the warriors, END
BEGIN NOW Looked the women at each other, END
BEGIN NOW Smiled, and said, "It cannot be so! END
BEGIN NOW Kaw! they said, "it cannot be so! END
BEGIN NOW O'er it, said he, o'er this water END
BEGIN NOW Came a great canoe with pinions, END
BEGIN NOW A canoe with wings came flying, END
BEGIN NOW Bigger than a grove of pine-trees, END
BEGIN NOW Taller than the tallest tree-tops! END
BEGIN NOW And the old men and the women END
BEGIN NOW Kaw! they said, "we don't believe it! END
BEGIN NOW From its mouth, he said, to greet him, END
BEGIN NOW Came Waywassimo, the lightning, END
BEGIN NOW Came the thunder, Annemeekee! END
BEGIN NOW And the warriors and the women END
BEGIN NOW Laughed aloud at poor Iagoo; END
BEGIN NOW Kaw! they said, "what tales you tell us! END
BEGIN NOW In it, said he, came a people, END
BEGIN NOW In the great canoe with pinions END
BEGIN NOW Came, he said, a hundred warriors; END
BEGIN NOW Painted white were all their faces END
BEGIN NOW And with hair their chins were covered! END
BEGIN NOW And the warriors and the women END
BEGIN NOW Laughed and shouted in derision, END
BEGIN NOW Like the ravens on the tree-tops, END
BEGIN NOW Like the crows upon the hemlocks. END
BEGIN NOW Kaw! they said, "what lies you tell us! END
BEGIN NOW Do not think that we believe them! END
BEGIN NOW Only Hiawatha laughed not, END
BEGIN NOW But he gravely spake and answered END
BEGIN NOW To their jeering and their jesting: END
BEGIN NOW True is all Iagoo tells us; END
BEGIN NOW I have seen it in a vision, END
BEGIN NOW Seen the great canoe with pinions, END
BEGIN NOW Seen the people with white faces, END
BEGIN NOW Seen the coming of this bearded END
BEGIN NOW People of the wooden vessel END
BEGIN NOW From the regions of the morning, END
BEGIN NOW From the shining land of Wabun. END
BEGIN NOW Sends them hither on his errand. END
BEGIN NOW Sends them to us with his message. END
BEGIN NOW Wheresoe'er they move, before them END
BEGIN NOW Swarms the stinging fly, the Ahmo, END
BEGIN NOW Swarms the bee, the honey-maker; END
BEGIN NOW Wheresoe'er they tread, beneath them END
BEGIN NOW Springs a flower unknown among us, END
BEGIN NOW Springs the White-man's Foot in blossom. END
BEGIN NOW Let us welcome, then, the strangers, END
BEGIN NOW Hail them as our friends and brothers, END
BEGIN NOW And the heart's right hand of friendship END
BEGIN NOW Give them when they come to see us. END
BEGIN NOW Said this to me in my vision. END
BEGIN NOW I beheld, too, in that vision END
BEGIN NOW All the secrets of the future, END
BEGIN NOW Of the distant days that shall be. END
BEGIN NOW I beheld the westward marches END
BEGIN NOW Of the unknown, crowded nations. END
BEGIN NOW All the land was full of people, END
BEGIN NOW Restless, struggling, toiling, striving, END
BEGIN NOW Speaking many tongues, yet feeling END
BEGIN NOW But one heart-beat in their bosoms. END
BEGIN NOW In the woodlands rang their axes, END
BEGIN NOW Smoked their towns in all the valleys, END
BEGIN NOW Over all the lakes and rivers END
BEGIN NOW Rushed their great canoes of thunder. END
BEGIN NOW Then a darker, drearier vision END
BEGIN NOW Passed before me, vague and cloud-like; END
BEGIN NOW I beheld our nation scattered, END
BEGIN NOW All forgetful of my counsels, END
BEGIN NOW Weakened, warring with each other: END
BEGIN NOW Saw the remnants of our people END
BEGIN NOW Sweeping westward, wild and woful, END
BEGIN NOW Like the cloud-rack of a tempest, END
BEGIN NOW Like the withered leaves of Autumn! END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha's Departure END
BEGIN NOW By the shore of Gitche Gumee, END
BEGIN NOW By the shining Big-Sea-Water, END
BEGIN NOW At the doorway of his wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW In the pleasant Summer morning, END
BEGIN NOW Hiawatha stood and waited. END
BEGIN NOW All the air was full of freshness, END
BEGIN NOW All the earth was bright and joyous, END
BEGIN NOW And before him, through the sunshine, END
BEGIN NOW Westward toward the neighboring forest END
BEGIN NOW Passed in golden swarms the Ahmo, END
BEGIN NOW Passed the bees, the honey-makers, END
BEGIN NOW Burning, singing in the sunshine. END
BEGIN NOW Bright above him shone the heavens, END
BEGIN NOW Level spread the lake before him; END
BEGIN NOW From its bosom leaped the sturgeon, END
BEGIN NOW Sparkling, flashing in the sunshine; END
BEGIN NOW On its margin the great forest END
BEGIN NOW Stood reflected in the water, END
BEGIN NOW Every tree-top had its shadow, END
BEGIN NOW Motionless beneath the water. END
BEGIN NOW From the brow of Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Gone was every trace of sorrow, END
BEGIN NOW As the fog from off the water, END
BEGIN NOW As the mist from off the meadow. END
BEGIN NOW With a smile of joy and triumph, END
BEGIN NOW With a look of exultation, END
BEGIN NOW As of one who in a vision END
BEGIN NOW Sees what is to be, but is not, END
BEGIN NOW Stood and waited Hiawatha. END
BEGIN NOW Toward the sun his hands were lifted, END
BEGIN NOW Both the palms spread out against it, END
BEGIN NOW And between the parted fingers END
BEGIN NOW Fell the sunshine on his features, END
BEGIN NOW Flecked with light his naked shoulders, END
BEGIN NOW As it falls and flecks an oak-tree END
BEGIN NOW Through the rifted leaves and branches. END
BEGIN NOW O'er the water floating, flying, END
BEGIN NOW Something in the hazy distance, END
BEGIN NOW Something in the mists of morning, END
BEGIN NOW Loomed and lifted from the water, END
BEGIN NOW Now seemed floating, now seemed flying, END
BEGIN NOW Coming nearer, nearer, nearer. END
BEGIN NOW Was it Shingebis the diver? END
BEGIN NOW Or the pelican, the Shada? END
BEGIN NOW Or the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah? END
BEGIN NOW Or the white goose, Waw-be-wawa, END
BEGIN NOW With the water dripping, flashing, END
BEGIN NOW From its glossy neck and feathers? END
BEGIN NOW It was neither goose nor diver, END
BEGIN NOW Neither pelican nor heron, END
BEGIN NOW O'er the water floating, flying, END
BEGIN NOW Through the shining mist of morning, END
BEGIN NOW But a birch canoe with paddles, END
BEGIN NOW Rising, sinking on the water, END
BEGIN NOW Dripping, flashing in the sunshine; END
BEGIN NOW And within it came a people END
BEGIN NOW From the distant land of Wabun, END
BEGIN NOW From the farthest realms of morning END
BEGIN NOW Came the Black-Robe chief, the Prophet, END
BEGIN NOW He the Priest of Prayer, the Pale-face, END
BEGIN NOW With his guides and his companions. END
BEGIN NOW And the noble Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW With his hands aloft extended, END
BEGIN NOW Held aloft in sign of welcome, END
BEGIN NOW Waited, full of exultation, END
BEGIN NOW Till the birch canoe with paddles END
BEGIN NOW Grated on the shining pebbles, END
BEGIN NOW Stranded on the sandy margin, END
BEGIN NOW Till the Black-Robe chief, the Pale-face, END
BEGIN NOW With the cross upon his bosom, END
BEGIN NOW Landed on the sandy margin. END
BEGIN NOW Then the joyous Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Cried aloud and spake in this wise: END
BEGIN NOW Beautiful is the sun, O strangers, END
BEGIN NOW When you come so far to see us! END
BEGIN NOW All our town in peace awaits you, END
BEGIN NOW All our doors stand open for you; END
BEGIN NOW You shall enter all our wigwams, END
BEGIN NOW For the heart's right hand we give you. END
BEGIN NOW Never bloomed the earth so gayly, END
BEGIN NOW Never shone the sun so brightly, END
BEGIN NOW As to-day they shine and blossom END
BEGIN NOW When you come so far to see us! END
BEGIN NOW Never was our lake so tranquil, END
BEGIN NOW Nor so free from rocks, and sand-bars; END
BEGIN NOW For your birch canoe in passing END
BEGIN NOW Has removed both rock and sand-bar. END
BEGIN NOW Never before had our tobacco END
BEGIN NOW Such a sweet and pleasant flavor, END
BEGIN NOW Never the broad leaves of our cornfields END
BEGIN NOW Were so beautiful to look on, END
BEGIN NOW As they seem to us this morning, END
BEGIN NOW When you come so far to see us! END
BEGIN NOW And the Black-Robe chief made answer, END
BEGIN NOW Stammered in his speech a little, END
BEGIN NOW Speaking words yet unfamiliar: END
BEGIN NOW Peace be with you, Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Peace be with you and your people, END
BEGIN NOW Peace of prayer, and peace of pardon, END
BEGIN NOW Then the generous Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Led the strangers to his wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW Seated them on skins of bison, END
BEGIN NOW Seated them on skins of ermine, END
BEGIN NOW And the careful old Nokomis END
BEGIN NOW Brought them food in bowls of basswood, END
BEGIN NOW Water brought in birchen dippers, END
BEGIN NOW And the calumet, the peace-pipe, END
BEGIN NOW Filled and lighted for their smoking. END
BEGIN NOW All the old men of the village, END
BEGIN NOW All the warriors of the nation, END
BEGIN NOW The magicians, the Wabenos, END
BEGIN NOW And the Medicine-men, the Medas, END
BEGIN NOW Came to bid the strangers welcome; END
BEGIN NOW It is well", they said, "O brothers, END
BEGIN NOW That you come so far to see us! END
BEGIN NOW In a circle round the doorway, END
BEGIN NOW With their pipes they sat in silence, END
BEGIN NOW Waiting to behold the strangers, END
BEGIN NOW Waiting to receive their message; END
BEGIN NOW Till the Black-Robe chief, the Pale-face, END
BEGIN NOW From the wigwam came to greet them, END
BEGIN NOW Stammering in his speech a little, END
BEGIN NOW Speaking words yet unfamiliar; END
BEGIN NOW It is well," they said, "O brother, END
BEGIN NOW That you come so far to see us! END
BEGIN NOW Then the Black-Robe chief, the Prophet, END
BEGIN NOW Told his message to the people, END
BEGIN NOW Told the purport of his mission, END
BEGIN NOW Told them of the Virgin Mary, END
BEGIN NOW And her blessed Son, the Saviour, END
BEGIN NOW How in distant lands and ages END
BEGIN NOW He had lived on earth as we do; END
BEGIN NOW How he fasted, prayed, and labored; END
BEGIN NOW Mocked him, scourged him, crucified him; END
BEGIN NOW How he rose from where they laid him, END
BEGIN NOW Walked again with his disciples, END
BEGIN NOW And ascended into heaven. END
BEGIN NOW And the chiefs made answer, saying: END
BEGIN NOW We have listened to your message, END
BEGIN NOW We have heard your words of wisdom, END
BEGIN NOW We will think on what you tell us. END
BEGIN NOW It is well for us, O brothers, END
BEGIN NOW That you come so far to see us! END
BEGIN NOW Then they rose up and departed END
BEGIN NOW Each one homeward to his wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW To the young men and the women END
BEGIN NOW Told the story of the strangers END
BEGIN NOW Whom the Master of Life had sent them END
BEGIN NOW From the shining land of Wabun. END
BEGIN NOW Heavy with the heat and silence END
BEGIN NOW Grew the afternoon of Summer; END
BEGIN NOW With a drowsy sound the forest END
BEGIN NOW Whispered round the sultry wigwam, END
BEGIN NOW With a sound of sleep the water END
BEGIN NOW Rippled on the beach below it; END
BEGIN NOW From the cornfields shrill and ceaseless END
BEGIN NOW Sang the grasshopper, Pah-puk-keena; END
BEGIN NOW And the guests of Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Weary with the heat of Summer, END
BEGIN NOW Slumbered in the sultry wigwam. END
BEGIN NOW Slowly o'er the simmering landscape END
BEGIN NOW Fell the evening's dusk and coolness, END
BEGIN NOW And the long and level sunbeams END
BEGIN NOW Shot their spears into the forest, END
BEGIN NOW Breaking through its shields of shadow, END
BEGIN NOW Rushed into each secret ambush, END
BEGIN NOW Searched each thicket, dingle, hollow; END
BEGIN NOW Still the guests of Hiawatha END
BEGIN NOW Slumbered in the silent wigwam. END
BEGIN NOW From his place rose Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Bade farewell to old Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW Spake in whispers, spake in this wise, END
BEGIN NOW Did not wake the guests, that slumbered. END
BEGIN NOW I am going, O Nokomis, END
BEGIN NOW On a long and distant journey, END
BEGIN NOW To the portals of the Sunset. END
BEGIN NOW To the regions of the home-wind, END
BEGIN NOW But these guests I leave behind me, END
BEGIN NOW In your watch and ward I leave them; END
BEGIN NOW See that never harm comes near them, END
BEGIN NOW See that never fear molests them, END
BEGIN NOW Never danger nor suspicion, END
BEGIN NOW Never want of food or shelter, END
BEGIN NOW In the lodge of Hiawatha! END
BEGIN NOW Forth into the village went he, END
BEGIN NOW Bade farewell to all the warriors, END
BEGIN NOW Bade farewell to all the young men, END
BEGIN NOW Spake persuading, spake in this wise: END
BEGIN NOW I am going, O my people, END
BEGIN NOW On a long and distant journey; END
BEGIN NOW Many moons and many winters END
BEGIN NOW Will have come, and will have vanished, END
BEGIN NOW Ere I come again to see you. END
BEGIN NOW But my guests I leave behind me; END
BEGIN NOW Listen to their words of wisdom, END
BEGIN NOW Listen to the truth they tell you, END
BEGIN NOW For the Master of Life has sent them END
BEGIN NOW From the land of light and morning! END
BEGIN NOW On the shore stood Hiawatha, END
BEGIN NOW Turned and waved his hand at parting; END
BEGIN NOW On the clear and luminous water END
BEGIN NOW Launched his birch canoe for sailing, END

BEGIN NOW So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain, END
BEGIN NOW Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare: END

BEGIN NOW O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers, END
BEGIN NOW That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr END
BEGIN NOW Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds END
BEGIN NOW Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King; END
BEGIN NOW And put to proof his high Supremacy, END
BEGIN NOW Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate, END
BEGIN NOW Too well I see and rue the dire event, END
BEGIN NOW That with sad overthrow and foul defeat END
BEGIN NOW Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host END
BEGIN NOW In horrible destruction laid thus low, END
BEGIN NOW As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences END
BEGIN NOW Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains END
BEGIN NOW Invincible, and vigour soon returns, END
BEGIN NOW Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state END
BEGIN NOW Here swallow'd up in endless misery. END
BEGIN NOW But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now END
BEGIN NOW Of force believe Almighty, since no less END
BEGIN NOW Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours) END
BEGIN NOW Have left us this our spirit and strength intire END
BEGIN NOW Strongly to suffer and support our pains, END
BEGIN NOW That we may so suffice his vengeful ire, END
BEGIN NOW Or do him mightier service as his thralls END
BEGIN NOW By right of Warr, what e're his business be END
BEGIN NOW Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire, END
BEGIN NOW Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep; END
BEGIN NOW What can it then avail though yet we feel END
BEGIN NOW Strength undiminisht, or eternal being END
BEGIN NOW To undergo eternal punishment? END
BEGIN NOW Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd. END
BEGIN NOW Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable END
BEGIN NOW Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure, END
BEGIN NOW To do ought good never will be our task, END
BEGIN NOW But ever to do ill our sole delight, END
BEGIN NOW As being the contrary to his high will END
BEGIN NOW Whom we resist. If then his Providence END
BEGIN NOW Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, END
BEGIN NOW Our labour must be to pervert that end, END
BEGIN NOW And out of good still to find means of evil; END
BEGIN NOW Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps END
BEGIN NOW Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb END
BEGIN NOW His inmost counsels from their destind aim. END
BEGIN NOW But see the angry Victor hath recall'd END
BEGIN NOW His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit END
BEGIN NOW Back to the Gates of Heav'n: The Sulphurous Hail END
BEGIN NOW Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid END
BEGIN NOW The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice END
BEGIN NOW Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder, END
BEGIN NOW Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage, END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now END
BEGIN NOW To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep. END
BEGIN NOW Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn, END
BEGIN NOW Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe. END
BEGIN NOW Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde, END
BEGIN NOW The seat of desolation, voyd of light, END
BEGIN NOW Save what the glimmering of these livid flames END
BEGIN NOW Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend END
BEGIN NOW From off the tossing of these fiery waves, END
BEGIN NOW There rest, if any rest can harbour there, END
BEGIN NOW And reassembling our afflicted Powers, END
BEGIN NOW Consult how we may henceforth most offend END
BEGIN NOW Our Enemy, our own loss how repair, END
BEGIN NOW How overcome this dire Calamity, END
BEGIN NOW What reinforcement we may gain from Hope, END
BEGIN NOW If not what resolution from despare. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate END
BEGIN NOW With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes END
BEGIN NOW That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides END
BEGIN NOW Prone on the Flood, extended long and large END
BEGIN NOW Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge END
BEGIN NOW As whom the Fables name of monstrous size, END
BEGIN NOW TITANIAN, or EARTH-BORN, that warr'd on JOVE, END
BEGIN NOW BRIARIOS or TYPHON, whom the Den END

BEGIN NOW The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff, END
BEGIN NOW Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell, END
BEGIN NOW With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind END
BEGIN NOW Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night END
BEGIN NOW Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes: END
BEGIN NOW So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay END
BEGIN NOW Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence END
BEGIN NOW Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will END
BEGIN NOW And high permission of all-ruling Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Left him at large to his own dark designs, END
BEGIN NOW That with reiterated crimes he might END
BEGIN NOW Heap on himself damnation, while he sought END
BEGIN NOW Evil to others, and enrag'd might see END
BEGIN NOW How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth END
BEGIN NOW Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn END
BEGIN NOW On Man by him seduc't, but on himself END
BEGIN NOW Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd. END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool END
BEGIN NOW His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames END
BEGIN NOW Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowld END
BEGIN NOW In billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale. END
BEGIN NOW Then with expanded wings he stears his flight END
BEGIN NOW Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air END
BEGIN NOW That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land END
BEGIN NOW He lights, if it were Land that ever burn'd END
BEGIN NOW With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire; END
BEGIN NOW And such appear'd in hue, as when the force END
BEGIN NOW Of subterranean wind transports a Hill END
BEGIN NOW Torn from PELORUS, or the shatter'd side END
BEGIN NOW Of thundring AETNA, whose combustible END
BEGIN NOW And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire, END

BEGIN NOW As Gods, and by their own recover'd strength, END
BEGIN NOW Not by the sufferance of supernal Power. END
BEGIN NOW Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime, END
BEGIN NOW Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat END
BEGIN NOW That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom END
BEGIN NOW For that celestial light? Be it so, since hee END
BEGIN NOW Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid END
BEGIN NOW What shall be right: fardest from him is best END
BEGIN NOW Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream END
BEGIN NOW Above his equals. Farewel happy Fields END
BEGIN NOW Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail END
BEGIN NOW Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell END
BEGIN NOW Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings END
BEGIN NOW A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time. END
BEGIN NOW The mind is its own place, and in it self END
BEGIN NOW Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n. END
BEGIN NOW What matter where, if I be still the same, END
BEGIN NOW And what I should be, all but less then hee END
BEGIN NOW Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least END
BEGIN NOW We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built END
BEGIN NOW Here for his envy, will not drive us hence: END
BEGIN NOW Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce END
BEGIN NOW To reign is worth ambition though in Hell: END
BEGIN NOW Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n. END
BEGIN NOW But wherefore let we then our faithful friends, END
BEGIN NOW Th' associates and copartners of our loss END
BEGIN NOW Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool, END
BEGIN NOW And call them not to share with us their part END
BEGIN NOW In this unhappy Mansion, or once more END
BEGIN NOW With rallied Arms to try what may be yet END
BEGIN NOW Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell? END
BEGIN NOW So SATAN spake, and him BEELZEBUB END
BEGIN NOW Thus answer'd. Leader of those Armies bright, END
BEGIN NOW Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld, END
BEGIN NOW If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge END
BEGIN NOW Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft END
BEGIN NOW In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge END
BEGIN NOW Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults END
BEGIN NOW Their surest signal, they will soon resume END
BEGIN NOW New courage and revive, though now they lye END
BEGIN NOW Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire, END
BEGIN NOW As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd, END
BEGIN NOW No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth. END
BEGIN NOW He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend END
BEGIN NOW Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield END
BEGIN NOW Ethereal temper, massy, large and round, END
BEGIN NOW Behind him cast; the broad circumference END
BEGIN NOW Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb END
BEGIN NOW Through Optic Glass the TUSCAN Artist views END
BEGIN NOW At Ev'ning from the top of FESOLE, END
BEGIN NOW Or in VALDARNO, to descry new Lands, END
BEGIN NOW Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe. END

BEGIN NOW Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand, END
BEGIN NOW He walkt with to support uneasie steps END
BEGIN NOW Over the burning Marle, not like those steps END
BEGIN NOW On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime END
BEGIN NOW Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire; END
BEGIN NOW Nathless he so endur'd, till on the Beach END
BEGIN NOW Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd END
BEGIN NOW His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't END
BEGIN NOW Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks END
BEGIN NOW In VALLOMBROSA, where th' ETRURIAN shades END

BEGIN NOW If such astonishment as this can sieze END

BEGIN NOW For me, be witness all the Host of Heav'n, END
BEGIN NOW If counsels different, or danger shun'd END

BEGIN NOW Consent or custome, and his Regal State END
BEGIN NOW Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd, END
BEGIN NOW Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall. END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth his might we know, and know our own END
BEGIN NOW So as not either to provoke, or dread END
BEGIN NOW New warr, provok't; our better part remains END
BEGIN NOW To work in close design, by fraud or guile END
BEGIN NOW What force effected not: that he no less END
BEGIN NOW At length from us may find, who overcomes END

BEGIN NOW Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere: END
BEGIN NOW For this Infernal Pit shall never hold END
BEGIN NOW Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts END
BEGIN NOW Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird, END
BEGIN NOW For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr END
BEGIN NOW Open or understood must be resolv'd. END
BEGIN NOW He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew END
BEGIN NOW Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs END
BEGIN NOW Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze END
BEGIN NOW Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd END
BEGIN NOW Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm's END
BEGIN NOW Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war, END
BEGIN NOW Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav'n. END
BEGIN NOW There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top END
BEGIN NOW Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire END
BEGIN NOW Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign END
BEGIN NOW That in his womb was hid metallic Ore, END
BEGIN NOW The work of Sulphur. Thither wing'd with speed END
BEGIN NOW A numerous Brigad hasten'd. As when bands END
BEGIN NOW Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field, END
BEGIN NOW Or cast a Rampart. MAMMON led them on, END
BEGIN NOW MAMMON, the least erected Spirit that fell END
BEGIN NOW From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks & thoughts END
BEGIN NOW Were always downward bent, admiring more END
BEGIN NOW The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n Gold, END
BEGIN NOW Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd END
BEGIN NOW In vision beatific: by him first END
BEGIN NOW Men also, and by his suggestion taught, END
BEGIN NOW Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands END
BEGIN NOW Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth END
BEGIN NOW For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew END
BEGIN NOW Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound END
BEGIN NOW And dig'd out ribs of Gold. Let none admire END
BEGIN NOW That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best END
BEGIN NOW Deserve the pretious bane. And here let those END
BEGIN NOW Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell END
BEGIN NOW Of BABEL, and the works of MEMPHIAN Kings, END
BEGIN NOW Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame, END
BEGIN NOW And Strength and Art are easily outdone END
BEGIN NOW By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour END
BEGIN NOW What in an age they with incessant toyle END
BEGIN NOW And hands innumerable scarce perform END
BEGIN NOW Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd, END
BEGIN NOW That underneath had veins of liquid fire END
BEGIN NOW Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude END
BEGIN NOW With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore, END
BEGIN NOW Severing each kinde, and scum'd the Bullion dross: END
BEGIN NOW A third as soon had form'd within the ground END
BEGIN NOW A various mould, and from the boyling cells END
BEGIN NOW By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook, END
BEGIN NOW As in an Organ from one blast of wind END
BEGIN NOW To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths. END
BEGIN NOW Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge END
BEGIN NOW Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound END
BEGIN NOW Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet, END
BEGIN NOW Built like a Temple, where PILASTERS round END
BEGIN NOW Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid END
BEGIN NOW With Golden Architrave; nor did there want END
BEGIN NOW Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n, END
BEGIN NOW The Roof was fretted Gold. Not BABILON, END
BEGIN NOW Nor great ALCAIRO such magnificence END
BEGIN NOW Equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine END

BEGIN NOW With Naphtha and ASPHALTUS yeilded light END
BEGIN NOW As from a sky. The hasty multitude END
BEGIN NOW Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise END
BEGIN NOW And some the Architect: his hand was known END
BEGIN NOW In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high, END
BEGIN NOW Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence, END
BEGIN NOW And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King END

BEGIN NOW A Summers day; and with the setting Sun END
BEGIN NOW Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star, END
BEGIN NOW On LEMNOS th' AEGAEAN Ile: thus they relate, END
BEGIN NOW Erring; for he with this rebellious rout END
BEGIN NOW Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now END
BEGIN NOW To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape END
BEGIN NOW By all his Engins, but was headlong sent END
BEGIN NOW With his industrious crew to build in hell. END
BEGIN NOW Mean while the winged Haralds by command END

BEGIN NOW And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall END
BEGIN NOW (Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold END
BEGIN NOW Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair END
BEGIN NOW Defi'd the best of Panim chivalry END
BEGIN NOW To mortal combat or carreer with Lance) END
BEGIN NOW Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air, END
BEGIN NOW Brusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees END
BEGIN NOW In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides, END
BEGIN NOW Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive END
BEGIN NOW In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers END
BEGIN NOW Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank, END
BEGIN NOW The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel, END
BEGIN NOW New rub'd with Baume, expatiate and confer END
BEGIN NOW Thir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd END
BEGIN NOW Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n, END
BEGIN NOW Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd END
BEGIN NOW In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons END
BEGIN NOW Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room END
BEGIN NOW Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the INDIAN Mount, or Faerie Elves, END
BEGIN NOW Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side END
BEGIN NOW Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees, END
BEGIN NOW Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon END
BEGIN NOW Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth END
BEGIN NOW Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth & dance END
BEGIN NOW Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear; END
BEGIN NOW At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds. END
BEGIN NOW Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms END
BEGIN NOW Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at large, END
BEGIN NOW Though without number still amidst the Hall END
BEGIN NOW Of that infernal Court. But far within END
BEGIN NOW And in thir own dimensions like themselves END
BEGIN NOW The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim END
BEGIN NOW In close recess and secret conclave sat END
BEGIN NOW A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat's, END
BEGIN NOW Frequent and full. After short silence then END
BEGIN NOW And summons read, the great consult began. END
BEGIN NOW High on a Throne of Royal State, which far END

BEGIN NOW Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand END
BEGIN NOW Showrs on her Kings BARBARIC Pearl & Gold, END
BEGIN NOW Satan exalted sat, by merit rais'd END
BEGIN NOW To that bad eminence; and from despair END
BEGIN NOW Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires END
BEGIN NOW Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue END
BEGIN NOW Vain Warr with Heav'n, and by success untaught END
BEGIN NOW His proud imaginations thus displaid. END
BEGIN NOW Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav'n, END
BEGIN NOW For since no deep within her gulf can hold END
BEGIN NOW Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall'n, END
BEGIN NOW I give not Heav'n for lost. From this descent END
BEGIN NOW Celestial vertues rising, will appear END
BEGIN NOW More glorious and more dread then from no fall, END
BEGIN NOW And trust themselves to fear no second fate: END
BEGIN NOW Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav'n END
BEGIN NOW Did first create your Leader, next, free choice, END
BEGIN NOW With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight, END
BEGIN NOW Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss END
BEGIN NOW Thus farr at least recover'd, hath much more END
BEGIN NOW Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne END
BEGIN NOW Yeilded with full consent. The happier state END

BEGIN NOW Envy from each inferior; but who here END
BEGIN NOW Will envy whom the highest place exposes END
BEGIN NOW Formost to stand against the Thunderers aime END
BEGIN NOW Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share END
BEGIN NOW Of endless pain? where there is then no good END
BEGIN NOW For which to strive, no strife can grow up there END
BEGIN NOW From Faction; for none sure will claim in hell END
BEGIN NOW Precedence, none, whose portion is so small END
BEGIN NOW Of present pain, that with ambitious mind END
BEGIN NOW Will covet more. With this advantage then END

BEGIN NOW Our torments also may in length of time END

BEGIN NOW Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote END
BEGIN NOW Inclines, here to continue, and build up here END
BEGIN NOW A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream, END

BEGIN NOW The punie habitants, or if not drive, END
BEGIN NOW Seduce them to our Party, that thir God END

BEGIN NOW Hatching vain Empires. Thus BEELZEBUB END
BEGIN NOW Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis'd END
BEGIN NOW By SATAN, and in part propos'd: for whence, END
BEGIN NOW But from the Author of all ill could Spring END
BEGIN NOW So deep a malice, to confound the race END
BEGIN NOW Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell END
BEGIN NOW To mingle and involve, done all to spite END
BEGIN NOW The great Creatour? But thir spite still serves END
BEGIN NOW His glory to augment. The bold design END
BEGIN NOW Pleas'd highly those infernal States, and joy END
BEGIN NOW Sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent END
BEGIN NOW They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. END
BEGIN NOW Well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate, END
BEGIN NOW Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are, END
BEGIN NOW Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep END

BEGIN NOW Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view END
BEGIN NOW Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms END
BEGIN NOW And opportune excursion we may chance END
BEGIN NOW Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde Zone END
BEGIN NOW Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair Light END
BEGIN NOW Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam END
BEGIN NOW Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air, END
BEGIN NOW To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires END
BEGIN NOW Shall breath her balme. But first whom shall we send END
BEGIN NOW In search of this new world, whom shall we find END
BEGIN NOW Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet END
BEGIN NOW The dark unbottom'd infinite Abyss END
BEGIN NOW And through the palpable obscure find out END
BEGIN NOW His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight END
BEGIN NOW Upborn with indefatigable wings END
BEGIN NOW Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive END
BEGIN NOW The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then END
BEGIN NOW Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe END
BEGIN NOW Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick END
BEGIN NOW Of Angels watching round? Here he had need END
BEGIN NOW All circumspection, and we now no less END
BEGIN NOW Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, END
BEGIN NOW The weight of all and our last hope relies. END
BEGIN NOW This said, he sat; and expectation held END
BEGIN NOW His look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd END
BEGIN NOW To second, or oppose, or undertake END

BEGIN NOW Of those Heav'n-warring Champions could be found END
BEGIN NOW So hardie as to proffer or accept END
BEGIN NOW Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last END
BEGIN NOW SATAN, whom now transcendent glory rais'd END
BEGIN NOW Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride END
BEGIN NOW Conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake. END
BEGIN NOW O Progeny of Heav'n, Empyreal Thrones, END
BEGIN NOW With reason hath deep silence and demurr END
BEGIN NOW Seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way END
BEGIN NOW And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light; END
BEGIN NOW Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire, END
BEGIN NOW Outrageous to devour, immures us round END
BEGIN NOW Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant END
BEGIN NOW Barr'd over us prohibit all egress. END
BEGIN NOW These past, if any pass, the void profound END
BEGIN NOW Of unessential Night receives him next END

BEGIN NOW If thence he scape into what ever world, END

BEGIN NOW Then unknown dangers and as hard escape. END
BEGIN NOW But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers, END

BEGIN NOW With splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd END
BEGIN NOW And judg'd of public moment, in the shape END
BEGIN NOW Of difficulty or danger could deterre END
BEGIN NOW Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume END

BEGIN NOW Deliverance for us all: this enterprize END
BEGIN NOW None shall partake with me. Thus saying rose END
BEGIN NOW The Monarch, and prevented all reply, END
BEGIN NOW Prudent, least from his resolution rais'd END
BEGIN NOW Others among the chief might offer now END
BEGIN NOW (Certain to be refus'd) what erst they feard; END
BEGIN NOW And so refus'd might in opinion stand END
BEGIN NOW His rivals, winning cheap the high repute END
BEGIN NOW Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they END
BEGIN NOW Dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice END
BEGIN NOW Forbidding; and at once with him they rose; END
BEGIN NOW Thir rising all at once was as the sound END
BEGIN NOW Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend END
BEGIN NOW With awful reverence prone; and as a God END
BEGIN NOW Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav'n: END
BEGIN NOW Nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd, END
BEGIN NOW That for the general safety he despis'd END
BEGIN NOW His own: for neither do the Spirits damn'd END
BEGIN NOW Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast END
BEGIN NOW Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, END
BEGIN NOW Or close ambition varnisht o're with zeal. END
BEGIN NOW Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark END
BEGIN NOW Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief: END
BEGIN NOW As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds END

BEGIN NOW Scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip Snow, or showre; END
BEGIN NOW If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet END
BEGIN NOW Extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive, END
BEGIN NOW The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds END
BEGIN NOW Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. END
BEGIN NOW O shame to men! Devil with Devil damn'd END
BEGIN NOW Firm concord holds, men onely disagree END
BEGIN NOW Of Creatures rational, though under hope END
BEGIN NOW Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace, END
BEGIN NOW Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife END
BEGIN NOW Among themselves, and levie cruel warres, END
BEGIN NOW Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy: END
BEGIN NOW As if (which might induce us to accord) END
BEGIN NOW Man had not hellish foes anow besides, END
BEGIN NOW That day and night for his destruction waite. END
BEGIN NOW The STYGIAN Councel thus dissolv'd; and forth END
BEGIN NOW In order came the grand infernal Peers, END
BEGIN NOW Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd END
BEGIN NOW Alone th' Antagonist of Heav'n, nor less END
BEGIN NOW Then Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream, END
BEGIN NOW And God-like imitated State; him round END
BEGIN NOW A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos'd END
BEGIN NOW With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms. END
BEGIN NOW Then of thir Session ended they bid cry END
BEGIN NOW With Trumpets regal sound the great result: END
BEGIN NOW Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim END
BEGIN NOW Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie END
BEGIN NOW By Haralds voice explain'd: the hollow Abyss END
BEGIN NOW Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell END
BEGIN NOW With deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim. END
BEGIN NOW Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd END
BEGIN NOW By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers END
BEGIN NOW Disband, and wandring, each his several way END
BEGIN NOW Pursues, as inclination or sad choice END
BEGIN NOW Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find END

BEGIN NOW The irksome hours, till his great Chief return. END
BEGIN NOW Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime END
BEGIN NOW Upon the wing, or in swift race contend, END
BEGIN NOW As at th' Olympian Games or PYTHIAN fields; END
BEGIN NOW Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal END
BEGIN NOW With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form. END
BEGIN NOW As when to warn proud Cities warr appears END
BEGIN NOW Wag'd in the troubl'd Skie, and Armies rush END
BEGIN NOW To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van END
BEGIN NOW Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears END
BEGIN NOW Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms END
BEGIN NOW From either end of Heav'n the welkin burns. END
BEGIN NOW Others with vast TYPHOEAN rage more fell END
BEGIN NOW Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air END
BEGIN NOW In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. END
BEGIN NOW As when ALCIDES from OEALIA Crown'd END
BEGIN NOW With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore END
BEGIN NOW Through pain up by the roots THESSALIAN Pines, END
BEGIN NOW And LICHAS from the top of OETA threw END

BEGIN NOW Thir song was partial, but the harmony END
BEGIN NOW (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) END
BEGIN NOW Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment END

BEGIN NOW Of good and evil much they argu'd then, END
BEGIN NOW Of happiness and final misery, END

BEGIN NOW Down from th' Ecliptic, sped with hop'd success, END
BEGIN NOW Throws his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele, END
BEGIN NOW Nor staid, till on NIPHATES top he lights. END
BEGIN NOW O For that warning voice, which he who saw END
BEGIN NOW Th' APOCALYPS, heard cry in Heaven aloud, END
BEGIN NOW Then when the Dragon, put to second rout, END
BEGIN NOW Came furious down to be reveng'd on men, END
BEGIN NOW While time was, our first Parents had bin warnd END
BEGIN NOW The coming of thir secret foe, and scap'd END
BEGIN NOW Haply so scap'd his mortal snare; for now END
BEGIN NOW SATAN, now first inflam'd with rage, came down, END
BEGIN NOW The Tempter ere th' Accuser of man-kind, END
BEGIN NOW To wreck on innocent frail man his loss END
BEGIN NOW Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell: END
BEGIN NOW Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold, END
BEGIN NOW Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, END
BEGIN NOW Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth END
BEGIN NOW Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest, END
BEGIN NOW And like a devillish Engine back recoiles END
BEGIN NOW Upon himself; horror and doubt distract END
BEGIN NOW His troubl'd thoughts, and from the bottom stirr END
BEGIN NOW The Hell within him, for within him Hell END
BEGIN NOW He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell END
BEGIN NOW One step no more then from himself can fly END
BEGIN NOW By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair END
BEGIN NOW That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie END
BEGIN NOW Of what he was, what is, and what must be END
BEGIN NOW Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes towards EDEN which now in his view END
BEGIN NOW Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad, END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes towards Heav'n and the full-blazing Sun, END
BEGIN NOW Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre: END
BEGIN NOW Then much revolving, thus in sighs began. END
BEGIN NOW O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd, END
BEGIN NOW Look'st from thy sole Dominion like the God END
BEGIN NOW Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs END
BEGIN NOW Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call, END
BEGIN NOW But with no friendly voice, and add thy name END
BEGIN NOW O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams END
BEGIN NOW That bring to my remembrance from what state END
BEGIN NOW I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare; END
BEGIN NOW Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down END
BEGIN NOW Warring in Heav'n against Heav'ns matchless King: END
BEGIN NOW Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return END
BEGIN NOW From me, whom he created what I was END
BEGIN NOW In that bright eminence, and with his good END
BEGIN NOW Upbraided none; nor was his service hard. END
BEGIN NOW What could be less then to afford him praise, END
BEGIN NOW The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks, END
BEGIN NOW How due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me, END
BEGIN NOW And wrought but malice; lifted up so high END
BEGIN NOW I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher END
BEGIN NOW Would set me highest, and in a moment quit END
BEGIN NOW The debt immense of endless gratitude, END
BEGIN NOW So burthensome, still paying, still to ow; END
BEGIN NOW Forgetful what from him I still receivd, END
BEGIN NOW And understood not that a grateful mind END
BEGIN NOW By owing owes not, but still pays, at once END
BEGIN NOW Indebted and dischargd; what burden then? END
BEGIN NOW O had his powerful Destiny ordaind END
BEGIN NOW Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood END
BEGIN NOW Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais'd END
BEGIN NOW Ambition. Yet why not? som other Power END
BEGIN NOW As great might have aspir'd, and me though mean END
BEGIN NOW Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great END
BEGIN NOW Fell not, but stand unshak'n, from within END
BEGIN NOW Or from without, to all temptations arm'd. END
BEGIN NOW Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand? END
BEGIN NOW Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse, END
BEGIN NOW But Heav'ns free Love dealt equally to all? END
BEGIN NOW Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate, END
BEGIN NOW To me alike, it deals eternal woe. END
BEGIN NOW Nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will END
BEGIN NOW Chose freely what it now so justly rues. END
BEGIN NOW Me miserable! which way shall I flie END
BEGIN NOW Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire? END
BEGIN NOW Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell; END
BEGIN NOW And in the lowest deep a lower deep END
BEGIN NOW Still threatning to devour me opens wide, END
BEGIN NOW To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav'n. END
BEGIN NOW O then at last relent: is there no place END
BEGIN NOW Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left? END
BEGIN NOW None left but by submission; and that word END
BEGIN NOW DISDAIN forbids me, and my dread of shame END
BEGIN NOW Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc'd END
BEGIN NOW With other promises and other vaunts END
BEGIN NOW Then to submit, boasting I could subdue END
BEGIN NOW Th' Omnipotent. Ay me, they little know END
BEGIN NOW How dearly I abide that boast so vaine, END
BEGIN NOW Under what torments inwardly I groane; END
BEGIN NOW While they adore me on the Throne of Hell, END
BEGIN NOW With Diadem and Scepter high advanc'd END
BEGIN NOW The lower still I fall, onely Supream END
BEGIN NOW In miserie; such joy Ambition findes. END
BEGIN NOW But say I could repent and could obtaine END
BEGIN NOW By Act of Grace my former state; how soon END
BEGIN NOW Would highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay END
BEGIN NOW What feign'd submission swore: ease would recant END
BEGIN NOW Vows made in pain, as violent and void. END
BEGIN NOW For never can true reconcilement grow END
BEGIN NOW Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc'd so deep: END
BEGIN NOW Which would but lead me to a worse relapse END
BEGIN NOW And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare END
BEGIN NOW Short intermission bought with double smart. END
BEGIN NOW This knows my punisher; therefore as farr END
BEGIN NOW From granting hee, as I from begging peace: END
BEGIN NOW All hope excluded thus, behold in stead END
BEGIN NOW Of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight, END
BEGIN NOW Mankind created, and for him this World. END
BEGIN NOW So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear, END
BEGIN NOW Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost; END
BEGIN NOW Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least END
BEGIN NOW Divided Empire with Heav'ns King I hold END
BEGIN NOW By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne; END
BEGIN NOW As Man ere long, and this new World shall know. END
BEGIN NOW Thus while he spake, each passion dimm'd his face END
BEGIN NOW Thrice chang'd with pale, ire, envie and despair, END
BEGIN NOW Which marrd his borrow'd visage, and betraid END
BEGIN NOW Him counterfet, if any eye beheld. END
BEGIN NOW For heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule END
BEGIN NOW Are ever cleer. Whereof hee soon aware, END
BEGIN NOW Each perturbation smooth'd with outward calme, END
BEGIN NOW Artificer of fraud; and was the first END
BEGIN NOW That practisd falshood under saintly shew, END
BEGIN NOW Deep malice to conceale, couch't with revenge: END
BEGIN NOW Yet not anough had practisd to deceive END
BEGIN NOW URIEL once warnd; whose eye pursu'd him down END
BEGIN NOW The way he went, and on th' ASSYRIAN mount END
BEGIN NOW Saw him disfigur'd, more then could befall END
BEGIN NOW Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce END
BEGIN NOW He markd and mad demeanour, then alone, END
BEGIN NOW As he suppos'd, all unobserv'd, unseen. END
BEGIN NOW So on he fares, and to the border comes END
BEGIN NOW Of EDEN, where delicious Paradise, END
BEGIN NOW Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green, END
BEGIN NOW As with a rural mound the champain head END
BEGIN NOW Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides END

BEGIN NOW The verdurous wall of Paradise up sprung: END
BEGIN NOW Which to our general Sire gave prospect large END
BEGIN NOW Into his neather Empire neighbouring round. END
BEGIN NOW And higher then that Wall a circling row END
BEGIN NOW Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit, END
BEGIN NOW Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue END

BEGIN NOW Then ASMODEUS with the fishie fume, END
BEGIN NOW That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse END
BEGIN NOW Of TOBITS Son, and with a vengeance sent END
BEGIN NOW Now to th' ascent of that steep savage Hill END
BEGIN NOW SATAN had journied on, pensive and slow; END
BEGIN NOW But further way found none, so thick entwin'd, END
BEGIN NOW As one continu'd brake, the undergrowth END

BEGIN NOW On th' other side: which when th' arch-fellon saw END
BEGIN NOW Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt, END
BEGIN NOW At one slight bound high overleap'd all bound END
BEGIN NOW Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within END
BEGIN NOW Lights on his feet. As when a prowling Wolfe, END
BEGIN NOW Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, END
BEGIN NOW Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve END

BEGIN NOW So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe. END
BEGIN NOW Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life, END
BEGIN NOW The middle Tree and highest there that grew, END
BEGIN NOW Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life END
BEGIN NOW Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death END
BEGIN NOW To them who liv'd; nor on the vertue thought END

BEGIN NOW Slowly descended, and with right aspect END
BEGIN NOW Against the eastern Gate of Paradise END
BEGIN NOW Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock END

BEGIN NOW The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung END

BEGIN NOW More of th' Almighties works, and chiefly Man END
BEGIN NOW Gods latest Image: I describ'd his way END
BEGIN NOW Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate; END
BEGIN NOW But in the Mount that lies from EDEN North, END
BEGIN NOW Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks END
BEGIN NOW Alien from Heav'n, with passions foul obscur'd: END
BEGIN NOW Mine eye pursu'd him still, but under shade END
BEGIN NOW Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew END
BEGIN NOW I fear, hath ventur'd from the deep, to raise END
BEGIN NOW New troubles; him thy care must be to find. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd: END
BEGIN NOW URIEL, no wonder if thy perfet sight, END

BEGIN NOW Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold END

BEGIN NOW Had in her sober Liverie all things clad; END
BEGIN NOW Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird, END
BEGIN NOW They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests END
BEGIN NOW Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale; END
BEGIN NOW She all night long her amorous descant sung; END
BEGIN NOW Silence was pleas'd: now glow'd the Firmament END

BEGIN NOW He scarce had ended, when those two approachd END
BEGIN NOW And brief related whom they brought, wher found, END
BEGIN NOW How busied, in what form and posture coucht. END
BEGIN NOW To whom with stern regard thus GABRIEL spake. END
BEGIN NOW Why hast thou, SATAN, broke the bounds prescrib'd END
BEGIN NOW To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge END
BEGIN NOW Of others, who approve not to transgress END
BEGIN NOW By thy example, but have power and right END
BEGIN NOW To question thy bold entrance on this place; END
BEGIN NOW Imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those END
BEGIN NOW Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss? END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus SATAN with contemptuous brow. END
BEGIN NOW GABRIEL, thou hadst in Heav'n th' esteem of wise, END
BEGIN NOW And such I held thee; but this question askt END
BEGIN NOW Puts me in doubt. Lives ther who loves his pain? END
BEGIN NOW Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, END
BEGIN NOW Though thither doomd? Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt, END
BEGIN NOW And boldly venture to whatever place END
BEGIN NOW Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change END
BEGIN NOW Torment with ease, & soonest recompence END
BEGIN NOW Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; END
BEGIN NOW To thee no reason; who knowst only good, END
BEGIN NOW But evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object END
BEGIN NOW His will who bound us? let him surer barr END
BEGIN NOW His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay END
BEGIN NOW In that dark durance: thus much what was askt. END
BEGIN NOW The rest is true, they found me where they say; END
BEGIN NOW But that implies not violence or harme. END
BEGIN NOW Thus hee in scorn. The warlike Angel mov'd, END
BEGIN NOW Disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd. END
BEGIN NOW O loss of one in Heav'n to judge of wise, END
BEGIN NOW Since SATAN fell, whom follie overthrew, END
BEGIN NOW And now returns him from his prison scap't, END
BEGIN NOW Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise END
BEGIN NOW Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither END
BEGIN NOW Unlicenc't from his bounds in Hell prescrib'd; END
BEGIN NOW So wise he judges it to fly from pain END
BEGIN NOW However, and to scape his punishment. END
BEGIN NOW So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth, END
BEGIN NOW Which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight END
BEGIN NOW Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, END
BEGIN NOW Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain END
BEGIN NOW Can equal anger infinite provok't. END
BEGIN NOW But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee END
BEGIN NOW Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them END
BEGIN NOW Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they END
BEGIN NOW Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief, END
BEGIN NOW The first in flight from pain, had'st thou alleg'd END
BEGIN NOW To thy deserted host this cause of flight, END
BEGIN NOW Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. END
BEGIN NOW To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern. END
BEGIN NOW Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain, END
BEGIN NOW Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood END
BEGIN NOW Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide END
BEGIN NOW The blasting volied Thunder made all speed END
BEGIN NOW And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear. END
BEGIN NOW But still thy words at random, as before, END
BEGIN NOW Argue thy inexperience what behooves END
BEGIN NOW From hard assaies and ill successes past END
BEGIN NOW A faithful Leader, not to hazard all END
BEGIN NOW Through wayes of danger by himself untri'd. END
BEGIN NOW I therefore, I alone first undertook END
BEGIN NOW To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie END
BEGIN NOW This new created World, whereof in Hell END

BEGIN NOW Better abode, and my afflicted Powers END
BEGIN NOW To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire; END
BEGIN NOW Though for possession put to try once more END
BEGIN NOW What thou and thy gay Legions dare against; END
BEGIN NOW Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord END
BEGIN NOW High up in Heav'n, with songs to hymne his Throne, END
BEGIN NOW And practis'd distances to cringe, not fight. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the warriour Angel soon repli'd. END
BEGIN NOW To say and strait unsay, pretending first END
BEGIN NOW Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie, END
BEGIN NOW Argues no Leader, but a lyar trac't, END
BEGIN NOW SATAN, and couldst thou faithful add? O name, END
BEGIN NOW O sacred name of faithfulness profan'd! END
BEGIN NOW Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? END
BEGIN NOW Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head; END
BEGIN NOW Was this your discipline and faith ingag'd, END
BEGIN NOW Your military obedience, to dissolve END
BEGIN NOW Allegeance to th' acknowledg'd Power supream? END
BEGIN NOW And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem END
BEGIN NOW Patron of liberty, who more then thou END
BEGIN NOW Once fawn'd, and cring'd, and servilly ador'd END
BEGIN NOW Heav'ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope END
BEGIN NOW To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne? END
BEGIN NOW But mark what I arreede thee now, avant; END
BEGIN NOW Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre END
BEGIN NOW Within these hallowd limits thou appeer, END
BEGIN NOW Back to th' infernal pit I drag thee chaind, END
BEGIN NOW And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne END
BEGIN NOW The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd. END
BEGIN NOW So threatn'd hee, but SATAN to no threats END
BEGIN NOW Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli'd. END
BEGIN NOW Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines, END
BEGIN NOW Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then END
BEGIN NOW Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel END
BEGIN NOW From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King END
BEGIN NOW Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers, END
BEGIN NOW Us'd to the yoak, draw'st his triumphant wheels END
BEGIN NOW In progress through the rode of Heav'n Star-pav'd. END
BEGIN NOW While thus he spake, th' Angelic Squadron bright END
BEGIN NOW Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes END
BEGIN NOW Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round END
BEGIN NOW With ported Spears, as thick as when a field END
BEGIN NOW Of CERES ripe for harvest waving bends END
BEGIN NOW Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind END
BEGIN NOW Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands END
BEGIN NOW Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves END
BEGIN NOW Prove chaff. On th' other side SATAN allarm'd END
BEGIN NOW Collecting all his might dilated stood, END
BEGIN NOW Like TENERIFF or ATLAS unremov'd: END
BEGIN NOW His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest END
BEGIN NOW Sat horror Plum'd; nor wanted in his graspe END
BEGIN NOW What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds END
BEGIN NOW Might have ensu'd, nor onely Paradise END
BEGIN NOW In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope END
BEGIN NOW Of Heav'n perhaps, or all the Elements END
BEGIN NOW At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne END
BEGIN NOW With violence of this conflict, had not soon END
BEGIN NOW Th' Eternal to prevent such horrid fray END
BEGIN NOW Hung forth in Heav'n his golden Scales, yet seen END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt ASTREA and the SCORPION signe, END
BEGIN NOW Wherein all things created first he weighd, END
BEGIN NOW The pendulous round Earth with ballanc't Aire END
BEGIN NOW In counterpoise, now ponders all events, END
BEGIN NOW Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights END
BEGIN NOW The sequel each of parting and of fight; END
BEGIN NOW The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam; END
BEGIN NOW Which GABRIEL spying, thus bespake the Fiend. END
BEGIN NOW SATAN, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine, END
BEGIN NOW Neither our own but giv'n; what follie then END
BEGIN NOW To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more END
BEGIN NOW Then Heav'n permits, nor mine, though doubld now END
BEGIN NOW To trample thee as mire: for proof look up, END
BEGIN NOW And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign END
BEGIN NOW Where thou art weigh'd, & shown how light, how weak, END
BEGIN NOW If thou resist. The Fiend lookt up and knew END
BEGIN NOW His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled END
BEGIN NOW Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night. END
BEGIN NOW Now Morn her rosie steps in th' Eastern Clime END
BEGIN NOW Advancing, sow'd the Earth with Orient Pearle, END
BEGIN NOW When ADAM wak't, so customd, for his sleep END
BEGIN NOW Was Aerie light, from pure digestion bred, END
BEGIN NOW And temperat vapors bland, which th' only sound END
BEGIN NOW Of leaves and fuming rills, AURORA's fan, END
BEGIN NOW Lightly dispers'd, and the shrill Matin Song END
BEGIN NOW Of Birds on every bough; so much the more END
BEGIN NOW His wonder was to find unwak'nd EVE END
BEGIN NOW With Tresses discompos'd, and glowing Cheek, END
BEGIN NOW As through unquiet rest: he on his side END
BEGIN NOW Leaning half-rais'd, with looks of cordial Love END
BEGIN NOW Hung over her enamour'd, and beheld END
BEGIN NOW Beautie, which whether waking or asleep, END
BEGIN NOW Shot forth peculiar Graces; then with voice END
BEGIN NOW Milde, as when ZEPHYRUS on FLORA breathes, END
BEGIN NOW Her hand soft touching, whisperd thus. Awake END
BEGIN NOW My fairest, my espous'd, my latest found, END
BEGIN NOW Heav'ns last best gift, my ever new delight, END
BEGIN NOW Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field END
BEGIN NOW Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring END
BEGIN NOW Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove, END
BEGIN NOW What drops the Myrrhe, & what the balmie Reed, END
BEGIN NOW How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee END
BEGIN NOW Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet. END
BEGIN NOW Such whispering wak'd her, but with startl'd eye END
BEGIN NOW On ADAM, whom imbracing, thus she spake. END
BEGIN NOW O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose, END
BEGIN NOW My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see END
BEGIN NOW Thy face, and Morn return'd, for I this Night, END
BEGIN NOW Such night till this I never pass'd, have dream'd, END
BEGIN NOW If dream'd, not as I oft am wont, of thee, END
BEGIN NOW Works of day pass't, or morrows next designe, END
BEGIN NOW But of offence and trouble, which my mind END
BEGIN NOW Knew never till this irksom night; methought END
BEGIN NOW Close at mine ear one call'd me forth to walk END
BEGIN NOW With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said, END
BEGIN NOW Why sleepst thou EVE? now is the pleasant time, END
BEGIN NOW The cool, the silent, save where silence yields END
BEGIN NOW To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake END
BEGIN NOW Tunes sweetest his love-labor'd song; now reignes END
BEGIN NOW Full Orb'd the Moon, and with more pleasing light END
BEGIN NOW Shadowie sets off the face of things; in vain, END
BEGIN NOW If none regard; Heav'n wakes with all his eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire, END
BEGIN NOW In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment END
BEGIN NOW Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze. END
BEGIN NOW I rose as at thy call, but found thee not; END
BEGIN NOW To find thee I directed then my walk; END
BEGIN NOW And on, methought, alone I pass'd through ways END
BEGIN NOW That brought me on a sudden to the Tree END
BEGIN NOW Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem'd, END
BEGIN NOW Much fairer to my Fancie then by day: END
BEGIN NOW And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood END
BEGIN NOW One shap'd & wing'd like one of those from Heav'n END
BEGIN NOW By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill'd END
BEGIN NOW Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz'd; END
BEGIN NOW And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg'd, END
BEGIN NOW Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet, END
BEGIN NOW Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis'd? END
BEGIN NOW Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste? END
BEGIN NOW Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold END
BEGIN NOW Longer thy offerd good, why else set here? END
BEGIN NOW This said he paus'd not, but with ventrous Arme END
BEGIN NOW He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil'd END
BEGIN NOW At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold: END
BEGIN NOW But he thus overjoy'd, O Fruit Divine, END
BEGIN NOW Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt, END
BEGIN NOW Forbidd'n here, it seems, as onely fit END
BEGIN NOW For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men: END
BEGIN NOW And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more END
BEGIN NOW Communicated, more abundant growes, END
BEGIN NOW The Author not impair'd, but honourd more? END
BEGIN NOW Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic EVE, END
BEGIN NOW Partake thou also; happie though thou art, END
BEGIN NOW Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be: END
BEGIN NOW Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods END
BEGIN NOW Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind, END
BEGIN NOW But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes END
BEGIN NOW Ascend to Heav'n, by merit thine, and see END
BEGIN NOW What life the Gods live there, and such live thou. END
BEGIN NOW So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held, END
BEGIN NOW Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part END
BEGIN NOW Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell END
BEGIN NOW So quick'nd appetite, that I, methought, END
BEGIN NOW Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the Clouds END
BEGIN NOW With him I flew, and underneath beheld END
BEGIN NOW The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide END
BEGIN NOW And various: wondring at my flight and change END
BEGIN NOW To this high exaltation; suddenly END
BEGIN NOW My Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down, END
BEGIN NOW And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak'd END
BEGIN NOW To find this but a dream! Thus EVE her Night END
BEGIN NOW Related, and thus ADAM answerd sad. END
BEGIN NOW Best Image of my self and dearer half, END
BEGIN NOW The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep END
BEGIN NOW Affects me equally; nor can I like END
BEGIN NOW This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear; END
BEGIN NOW Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none, END
BEGIN NOW Created pure. But know that in the Soule END
BEGIN NOW Are many lesser Faculties that serve END
BEGIN NOW Reason as chief; among these Fansie next END
BEGIN NOW Her office holds; of all external things, END
BEGIN NOW Which the five watchful Senses represent, END
BEGIN NOW She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes, END
BEGIN NOW Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames END
BEGIN NOW All what we affirm or what deny, and call END
BEGIN NOW Our knowledge or opinion; then retires END
BEGIN NOW Into her private Cell when Nature rests. END
BEGIN NOW Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes END
BEGIN NOW To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes, END
BEGIN NOW Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams, END
BEGIN NOW Ill matching words and deeds long past or late. END
BEGIN NOW Som such resemblances methinks I find END
BEGIN NOW Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream, END
BEGIN NOW But with addition strange; yet be not sad. END
BEGIN NOW Evil into the mind of God or Man END
BEGIN NOW May come and go, so unapprov'd, and leave END
BEGIN NOW No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope END
BEGIN NOW That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream, END
BEGIN NOW Waking thou never wilt consent to do. END
BEGIN NOW Be not disheart'nd then, nor cloud those looks END
BEGIN NOW That wont to be more chearful and serene END
BEGIN NOW Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World, END
BEGIN NOW And let us to our fresh imployments rise END
BEGIN NOW That open now thir choicest bosom'd smells END
BEGIN NOW Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store. END
BEGIN NOW So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard, END
BEGIN NOW But silently a gentle tear let fall END
BEGIN NOW From either eye, and wip'd them with her haire; END
BEGIN NOW Two other precious drops that ready stood, END
BEGIN NOW Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell END
BEGIN NOW Kiss'd as the gracious signs of sweet remorse END
BEGIN NOW And pious awe, that feard to have offended. END
BEGIN NOW So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste. END
BEGIN NOW But first from under shadie arborous roof, END
BEGIN NOW Soon as they forth were come to open sight END
BEGIN NOW Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen END
BEGIN NOW With wheels yet hov'ring o're the Ocean brim, END
BEGIN NOW Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray, END
BEGIN NOW Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East END
BEGIN NOW Of Paradise and EDENS happie Plains, END
BEGIN NOW Lowly they bow'd adoring, and began END
BEGIN NOW Thir Orisons, each Morning duly paid END
BEGIN NOW In various style, for neither various style END
BEGIN NOW Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise END
BEGIN NOW Thir Maker, in fit strains pronounc't or sung END
BEGIN NOW Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence END
BEGIN NOW Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse, END
BEGIN NOW More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp END
BEGIN NOW To add more sweetness, and they thus began. END
BEGIN NOW These are thy glorious works, Parent of good, END
BEGIN NOW Almightie, thine this universal Frame, END
BEGIN NOW Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then! END
BEGIN NOW Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens END
BEGIN NOW To us invisible or dimly seen END
BEGIN NOW In these thy lowest works, yet these declare END
BEGIN NOW Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine: END
BEGIN NOW Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light, END
BEGIN NOW Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs END
BEGIN NOW And choral symphonies, Day without Night, END
BEGIN NOW Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav'n, END

BEGIN NOW Him first, him last, him midst, and without end. END
BEGIN NOW Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night, END
BEGIN NOW If better thou belong not to the dawn, END
BEGIN NOW Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn END
BEGIN NOW With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare END
BEGIN NOW While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime. END
BEGIN NOW Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule, END
BEGIN NOW Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise END
BEGIN NOW In thy eternal course, both when thou climb'st, END
BEGIN NOW And when high Noon hast gaind, & when thou fallst. END
BEGIN NOW Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli'st END
BEGIN NOW With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies, END
BEGIN NOW And yee five other wandring Fires that move END
BEGIN NOW In mystic Dance not without Song, resound END
BEGIN NOW His praise, who out of Darkness call'd up Light. END

BEGIN NOW Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers, END
BEGIN NOW Rising or falling still advance his praise. END
BEGIN NOW His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow, END
BEGIN NOW Breath soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines, END
BEGIN NOW With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave. END
BEGIN NOW Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow, END

BEGIN NOW ABDIEL that sight endur'd not, where he stood END
BEGIN NOW Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds, END
BEGIN NOW And thus his own undaunted heart explores. END
BEGIN NOW O Heav'n! that such resemblance of the Highest END

BEGIN NOW Before thy fellows, ambitious to win END
BEGIN NOW From me som Plume, that thy success may show END
BEGIN NOW Destruction to the rest: this pause between END
BEGIN NOW (Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know; END
BEGIN NOW At first I thought that Libertie and Heav'n END
BEGIN NOW To heav'nly Soules had bin all one; but now END
BEGIN NOW I see that most through sloth had rather serve, END
BEGIN NOW Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song; END
BEGIN NOW Such hast thou arm'd, the Minstrelsie of Heav'n, END
BEGIN NOW Servilitie with freedom to contend, END
BEGIN NOW As both thir deeds compar'd this day shall prove. END
BEGIN NOW To whom in brief thus ABDIEL stern repli'd. END
BEGIN NOW Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find END
BEGIN NOW Of erring, from the path of truth remote: END
BEGIN NOW Unjustly thou deprav'st it with the name END
BEGIN NOW Of SERVITUDE to serve whom God ordains, END
BEGIN NOW Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same, END
BEGIN NOW When he who rules is worthiest, and excells END
BEGIN NOW Them whom he governs. This is servitude, END
BEGIN NOW To serve th' unwise, or him who hath rebelld END
BEGIN NOW Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee, END
BEGIN NOW Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall'd; END
BEGIN NOW Yet leudly dar'st our ministring upbraid. END
BEGIN NOW Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve END
BEGIN NOW In Heav'n God ever blessed, and his Divine END
BEGIN NOW Behests obey, worthiest to be obey'd, END
BEGIN NOW Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while END
BEGIN NOW From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight, END
BEGIN NOW This greeting on thy impious Crest receive. END
BEGIN NOW So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high, END
BEGIN NOW Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell END
BEGIN NOW On the proud Crest of SATAN, that no sight, END
BEGIN NOW Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield END
BEGIN NOW Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge END
BEGIN NOW He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee END
BEGIN NOW His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth END

BEGIN NOW Sidelong, had push't a Mountain from his seat END
BEGIN NOW Half sunk with all his Pines. Amazement seis'd END
BEGIN NOW The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see END

BEGIN NOW Thy malice into thousands, once upright END

BEGIN NOW Nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files. END
BEGIN NOW What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse END
BEGIN NOW Repeated, and indecent overthrow END
BEGIN NOW Doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd, END
BEGIN NOW And to thir foes a laughter; for in view END

BEGIN NOW O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud? END
BEGIN NOW Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee, END
BEGIN NOW To entertain them fair with open Front END
BEGIN NOW And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms END
BEGIN NOW Of composition, strait they chang'd thir minds, END

BEGIN NOW Had need from head to foot well understand; END
BEGIN NOW Not understood, this gift they have besides, END
BEGIN NOW They shew us when our foes walk not upright. END
BEGIN NOW So they among themselves in pleasant veine END
BEGIN NOW Stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond END
BEGIN NOW All doubt of Victorie, eternal might END
BEGIN NOW To match with thir inventions they presum'd END
BEGIN NOW So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn, END
BEGIN NOW And all his Host derided, while they stood END
BEGIN NOW A while in trouble; but they stood not long, END
BEGIN NOW Rage prompted them at length, & found them arms END
BEGIN NOW Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power END
BEGIN NOW Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac'd) END
BEGIN NOW Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills END
BEGIN NOW (For Earth hath this variety from Heav'n END
BEGIN NOW Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale) END
BEGIN NOW Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew, END
BEGIN NOW From thir foundations loosning to and fro END
BEGIN NOW They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load, END
BEGIN NOW Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops END
BEGIN NOW Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze, END
BEGIN NOW Be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel Host, END
BEGIN NOW When coming towards them so dread they saw END
BEGIN NOW The bottom of the Mountains upward turn'd, END
BEGIN NOW Till on those cursed Engins triple-row END
BEGIN NOW They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence END
BEGIN NOW Under the weight of Mountains buried deep, END
BEGIN NOW Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads END
BEGIN NOW Main Promontories flung, which in the Air END
BEGIN NOW Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm'd, END
BEGIN NOW Thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and brus'd END
BEGIN NOW Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain END
BEGIN NOW Implacable, and many a dolorous groan, END
BEGIN NOW Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind END
BEGIN NOW Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, END
BEGIN NOW Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. END
BEGIN NOW The rest in imitation to like Armes END
BEGIN NOW Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore; END
BEGIN NOW So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills END
BEGIN NOW Hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire, END
BEGIN NOW That under ground they fought in dismal shade; END
BEGIN NOW Infernal noise; Warr seem'd a civil Game END
BEGIN NOW To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt END
BEGIN NOW Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav'n END
BEGIN NOW Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred, END
BEGIN NOW Had not th' Almightie Father where he sits END
BEGIN NOW Shrin'd in his Sanctuarie of Heav'n secure, END
BEGIN NOW Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen END
BEGIN NOW This tumult, and permitted all, advis'd: END
BEGIN NOW That his great purpose he might so fulfill, END
BEGIN NOW To honour his Anointed Son aveng'd END
BEGIN NOW Upon his enemies, and to declare END
BEGIN NOW All power on him transferr'd: whence to his Son END
BEGIN NOW Th' Assessor of his Throne he thus began. END
BEGIN NOW Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov'd, END
BEGIN NOW Son in whose face invisible is beheld END
BEGIN NOW Visibly, what by Deitie I am, END
BEGIN NOW And in whose hand what by Decree I doe, END
BEGIN NOW Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past, END
BEGIN NOW Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav'n, END
BEGIN NOW Since MICHAEL and his Powers went forth to tame END
BEGIN NOW These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight, END
BEGIN NOW As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm'd; END
BEGIN NOW For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst, END
BEGIN NOW Equal in their Creation they were form'd, END
BEGIN NOW Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought END
BEGIN NOW Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom; END
BEGIN NOW Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last END
BEGIN NOW Endless, and no solution will be found: END
BEGIN NOW Warr wearied hath perform'd what Warr can do, END
BEGIN NOW And to disorder'd rage let loose the reines, END
BEGIN NOW With Mountains as with Weapons arm'd, which makes END
BEGIN NOW Wild work in Heav'n, and dangerous to the maine. END
BEGIN NOW Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine; END
BEGIN NOW For thee I have ordain'd it, and thus farr END
BEGIN NOW Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine END
BEGIN NOW Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou END
BEGIN NOW Can end it. Into thee such Vertue and Grace END
BEGIN NOW Immense I have transfus'd, that all may know END
BEGIN NOW In Heav'n and Hell thy Power above compare, END
BEGIN NOW And this perverse Commotion governd thus, END
BEGIN NOW To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir END
BEGIN NOW Of all things, to be Heir and to be King END
BEGIN NOW By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right. END
BEGIN NOW Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might, END
BEGIN NOW Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles END
BEGIN NOW That shake Heav'ns basis, bring forth all my Warr, END
BEGIN NOW Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh; END
BEGIN NOW Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out END
BEGIN NOW From all Heav'ns bounds into the utter Deep: END
BEGIN NOW There let them learn, as likes them, to despise END
BEGIN NOW God and MESSIAH his anointed King. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct END
BEGIN NOW Shon full, he all his Father full exprest END
BEGIN NOW Ineffably into his face receiv'd, END
BEGIN NOW And thus the filial Godhead answering spake. END
BEGIN NOW O Father, O Supream of heav'nly Thrones, END
BEGIN NOW First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst END
BEGIN NOW To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee, END
BEGIN NOW As is most just; this I my Glorie account, END
BEGIN NOW My exaltation, and my whole delight, END
BEGIN NOW That thou in me well pleas'd, declarst thy will END
BEGIN NOW Fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss. END
BEGIN NOW Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume, END
BEGIN NOW And gladlier shall resign, when in the end END
BEGIN NOW Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee END
BEGIN NOW For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov'st: END
BEGIN NOW But whom thou hat'st, I hate, and can put on END
BEGIN NOW Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on, END
BEGIN NOW Image of thee in all things; and shall soon, END
BEGIN NOW Armd with thy might, rid heav'n of these rebell'd, END
BEGIN NOW To thir prepar'd ill Mansion driven down END
BEGIN NOW To chains of Darkness, and th' undying Worm, END
BEGIN NOW That from thy just obedience could revolt, END
BEGIN NOW Whom to obey is happiness entire. END
BEGIN NOW Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th' impure END
BEGIN NOW Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount END
BEGIN NOW Unfained HALLELUIAHS to thee sing, END
BEGIN NOW Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief. END
BEGIN NOW So said, he o're his Scepter bowing, rose END
BEGIN NOW From the right hand of Glorie where he sate, END
BEGIN NOW And the third sacred Morn began to shine END
BEGIN NOW Dawning through Heav'n: forth rush'd with whirlwind sound END
BEGIN NOW Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn, END
BEGIN NOW It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd END
BEGIN NOW By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each END
BEGIN NOW Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all END
BEGIN NOW And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels END
BEGIN NOW Of Beril, and careering Fires between; END
BEGIN NOW Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament, END
BEGIN NOW Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure END
BEGIN NOW Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch. END
BEGIN NOW Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd END
BEGIN NOW Of radiant URIM, work divinely wrought, END
BEGIN NOW Ascended, at his right hand Victorie END
BEGIN NOW Sate Eagle-wing'd, beside him hung his Bow END
BEGIN NOW And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor'd, END
BEGIN NOW And from about him fierce Effusion rowld END
BEGIN NOW Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire; END
BEGIN NOW Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, END
BEGIN NOW He onward came, farr off his coming shon, END
BEGIN NOW And twentie thousand (I thir number heard) END
BEGIN NOW Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen: END
BEGIN NOW Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime END
BEGIN NOW On the Crystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron'd. END
BEGIN NOW Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own END
BEGIN NOW First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz'd, END
BEGIN NOW When the great Ensign of MESSIAH blaz'd END
BEGIN NOW Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav'n: END
BEGIN NOW Under whose Conduct MICHAEL soon reduc'd END
BEGIN NOW His Armie, circumfus'd on either Wing, END
BEGIN NOW Under thir Head imbodied all in one. END
BEGIN NOW Before him Power Divine his way prepar'd; END
BEGIN NOW At his command the uprooted Hills retir'd END
BEGIN NOW Each to his place, they heard his voice and went END
BEGIN NOW Obsequious, Heav'n his wonted face renewd, END
BEGIN NOW And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil'd. END
BEGIN NOW This saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdur'd, END
BEGIN NOW And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers END
BEGIN NOW Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. END
BEGIN NOW In heav'nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? END
BEGIN NOW But to convince the proud what Signs availe, END
BEGIN NOW Or Wonders move th' obdurate to relent? END
BEGIN NOW They hard'nd more by what might most reclame, END
BEGIN NOW Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight END
BEGIN NOW Took envie, and aspiring to his highth, END
BEGIN NOW Stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud END
BEGIN NOW Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile END
BEGIN NOW Against God and MESSIAH, or to fall END
BEGIN NOW In universal ruin last, and now END
BEGIN NOW To final Battel drew, disdaining flight, END
BEGIN NOW Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God END
BEGIN NOW To all his Host on either hand thus spake. END
BEGIN NOW Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand END
BEGIN NOW Ye Angels arm'd, this day from Battel rest; END
BEGIN NOW Faithful hath been your Warfare, and of God END
BEGIN NOW Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause, END
BEGIN NOW And as ye have receivd, so have ye don END
BEGIN NOW Invincibly; but of this cursed crew END
BEGIN NOW The punishment to other hand belongs, END
BEGIN NOW Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints; END
BEGIN NOW Number to this dayes work is not ordain'd END
BEGIN NOW Nor multitude, stand onely and behold END
BEGIN NOW Gods indignation on these Godless pourd END
BEGIN NOW By mee; not you but mee they have despis'd, END
BEGIN NOW Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage, END
BEGIN NOW Because the Father, t' whom in Heav'n supream END
BEGIN NOW Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains, END
BEGIN NOW Hath honourd me according to his will. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig'n'd; END
BEGIN NOW That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee END
BEGIN NOW In Battel which the stronger proves, they all, END
BEGIN NOW Or I alone against them, since by strength END
BEGIN NOW They measure all, of other excellence END
BEGIN NOW Not emulous, nor care who them excells; END
BEGIN NOW Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Son, and into terrour chang'd END
BEGIN NOW His count'nance too severe to be beheld END
BEGIN NOW And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies. END
BEGIN NOW At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings END
BEGIN NOW With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes END
BEGIN NOW Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound END
BEGIN NOW Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host. END
BEGIN NOW Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove, END
BEGIN NOW Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles END
BEGIN NOW The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout, END
BEGIN NOW All but the Throne it self of God. Full soon END
BEGIN NOW Among them he arriv'd; in his right hand END
BEGIN NOW Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent END
BEGIN NOW Before him, such as in thir Soules infix'd END
BEGIN NOW Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost, END
BEGIN NOW All courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd; END
BEGIN NOW O're Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode END
BEGIN NOW Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, END
BEGIN NOW That wish'd the Mountains now might be again END
BEGIN NOW Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire. END
BEGIN NOW Nor less on either side tempestuous fell END
BEGIN NOW His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Foure, END
BEGIN NOW Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels, END
BEGIN NOW Distinct alike with multitude of eyes, END
BEGIN NOW One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye END
BEGIN NOW Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire END
BEGIN NOW Among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength, END
BEGIN NOW And of thir wonted vigour left them draind, END
BEGIN NOW Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n. END
BEGIN NOW Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd END
BEGIN NOW His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant END
BEGIN NOW Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n: END
BEGIN NOW The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Heard END
BEGIN NOW Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd END

BEGIN NOW And put not forth my goodness, which is free END
BEGIN NOW To act or not, Necessitie and Chance END

BEGIN NOW So spake th' Almightie, and to what he spake END
BEGIN NOW His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect. END
BEGIN NOW Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift END
BEGIN NOW Then time or motion, but to human ears END
BEGIN NOW Cannot without process of speech be told, END
BEGIN NOW So told as earthly notion can receave. END
BEGIN NOW Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav'n END
BEGIN NOW When such was heard declar'd the Almightie's will; END
BEGIN NOW Glorie they sung to the most High, good will END
BEGIN NOW To future men, and in thir dwellings peace: END
BEGIN NOW Glorie to him whose just avenging ire END
BEGIN NOW Had driven out th' ungodly from his sight END
BEGIN NOW And th' habitations of the just; to him END
BEGIN NOW Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain'd END
BEGIN NOW Good out of evil to create, in stead END
BEGIN NOW Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring END
BEGIN NOW Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse END
BEGIN NOW His good to Worlds and Ages infinite. END
BEGIN NOW So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son END
BEGIN NOW On his great Expedition now appeer'd, END
BEGIN NOW Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown'd END
BEGIN NOW Immense, and all his Father in him shon. END
BEGIN NOW About his Chariot numberless were pour'd END
BEGIN NOW And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing'd, END
BEGIN NOW From the Armoury of God, where stand of old END
BEGIN NOW Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg'd END
BEGIN NOW Against a solemn day, harnest at hand, END
BEGIN NOW Celestial Equipage; and now came forth END
BEGIN NOW Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd, END
BEGIN NOW Attendant on thir Lord: Heav'n op'nd wide END
BEGIN NOW Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound END
BEGIN NOW On golden Hinges moving, to let forth END
BEGIN NOW The King of Glorie in his powerful Word END
BEGIN NOW And Spirit coming to create new Worlds. END
BEGIN NOW On heav'nly ground they stood, and from the shore END
BEGIN NOW They view'd the vast immeasurable Abyss END
BEGIN NOW Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde, END
BEGIN NOW Up from the bottom turn'd by furious windes END
BEGIN NOW And surging waves, as Mountains to assault END
BEGIN NOW Heav'ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole. END
BEGIN NOW Silence, ye troubl'd waves, and thou Deep, peace, END
BEGIN NOW Said then th' Omnific Word, your discord end: END
BEGIN NOW Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim END
BEGIN NOW Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode END
BEGIN NOW Farr into CHAOS, and the World unborn; END
BEGIN NOW For CHAOS heard his voice: him all his Traine END
BEGIN NOW Follow'd in bright procession to behold END
BEGIN NOW Creation, and the wonders of his might. END
BEGIN NOW Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand END
BEGIN NOW He took the golden Compasses, prepar'd END
BEGIN NOW In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe END
BEGIN NOW This Universe, and all created things: END
BEGIN NOW One foot he center'd, and the other turn'd END
BEGIN NOW Round through the vast profunditie obscure, END
BEGIN NOW And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds, END
BEGIN NOW This be thy just Circumference, O World. END
BEGIN NOW Thus God the Heav'n created, thus the Earth, END
BEGIN NOW Matter unform'd and void: Darkness profound END
BEGIN NOW Cover'd th' Abyss: but on the watrie calme END
BEGIN NOW His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred, END
BEGIN NOW And vital vertue infus'd, and vital warmth END
BEGIN NOW Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg'd END
BEGIN NOW The black tartareous cold infernal dregs END
BEGIN NOW Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd END
BEGIN NOW Like things to like, the rest to several place END
BEGIN NOW Disparted, and between spun out the Air, END
BEGIN NOW And Earth self-ballanc't on her Center hung. END
BEGIN NOW Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light END
BEGIN NOW Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure END
BEGIN NOW Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East END
BEGIN NOW To journie through the airie gloom began, END
BEGIN NOW Sphear'd in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun END
BEGIN NOW Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle END
BEGIN NOW Sojourn'd the while. God saw the Light was good; END
BEGIN NOW And light from darkness by the Hemisphere END
BEGIN NOW He nam'd. Thus was the first Day Eev'n and Morn: END
BEGIN NOW Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung END
BEGIN NOW By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light END
BEGIN NOW Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld; END
BEGIN NOW Birth-day of Heav'n and Earth; with joy and shout END
BEGIN NOW The hollow Universal Orb they fill'd, END
BEGIN NOW And touch't thir Golden Harps, & hymning prais'd END
BEGIN NOW God and his works, Creatour him they sung, END
BEGIN NOW Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn. END
BEGIN NOW Again, God said, let ther be Firmament END
BEGIN NOW Amid the Waters, and let it divide END
BEGIN NOW The Waters from the Waters: and God made END
BEGIN NOW The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, END
BEGIN NOW Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus'd END
BEGIN NOW In circuit to the uttermost convex END
BEGIN NOW Of this great Round: partition firm and sure, END
BEGIN NOW The Waters underneath from those above END
BEGIN NOW Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide END
BEGIN NOW Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule END
BEGIN NOW Of CHAOS farr remov'd, least fierce extreames END
BEGIN NOW Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: END
BEGIN NOW And Heav'n he nam'd the Firmament: So Eev'n END
BEGIN NOW And Morning CHORUS sung the second Day. END
BEGIN NOW The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet END
BEGIN NOW Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd, END
BEGIN NOW Appeer'd not: over all the face of Earth END
BEGIN NOW Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with warme END
BEGIN NOW Prolific humour soft'ning all her Globe, END
BEGIN NOW Fermented the great Mother to conceave, END
BEGIN NOW Satiate with genial moisture, when God said END
BEGIN NOW Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n END
BEGIN NOW Into one place, and let dry Land appeer. END
BEGIN NOW Immediately the Mountains huge appeer END
BEGIN NOW Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave END
BEGIN NOW Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie: END
BEGIN NOW So high as heav'd the tumid Hills, so low END
BEGIN NOW Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, END
BEGIN NOW Capacious bed of Waters: thither they END
BEGIN NOW Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld END
BEGIN NOW As drops on dust conglobing from the drie; END
BEGIN NOW Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct, END
BEGIN NOW For haste; such flight the great command impress'd END
BEGIN NOW On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call END
BEGIN NOW Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard) END
BEGIN NOW Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng, END
BEGIN NOW Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found, END
BEGIN NOW If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine, END
BEGIN NOW Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill, END
BEGIN NOW But they, or under ground, or circuit wide END
BEGIN NOW With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way, END
BEGIN NOW And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore; END
BEGIN NOW Easie, e're God had bid the ground be drie, END
BEGIN NOW All but within those banks, where Rivers now END
BEGIN NOW Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine. END
BEGIN NOW The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle END
BEGIN NOW Of congregated Waters he call'd Seas: END
BEGIN NOW And saw that it was good, and said, Let th' Earth END
BEGIN NOW Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed, END
BEGIN NOW And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind; END
BEGIN NOW Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth. END
BEGIN NOW He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then END
BEGIN NOW Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd, END
BEGIN NOW Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad END
BEGIN NOW Her Universal Face with pleasant green, END
BEGIN NOW Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd END
BEGIN NOW Op'ning thir various colours, and made gay END
BEGIN NOW Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, END
BEGIN NOW Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept END
BEGIN NOW The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed END
BEGIN NOW Embattell'd in her field: add the humble Shrub, END
BEGIN NOW And Bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last END
BEGIN NOW Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred END
BEGIN NOW Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd END
BEGIN NOW Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd, END
BEGIN NOW With tufts the vallies & each fountain side, END
BEGIN NOW With borders long the Rivers. That Earth now END
BEGIN NOW Seemd like to Heav'n, a seat where Gods might dwell, END
BEGIN NOW Or wander with delight, and love to haunt END
BEGIN NOW Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain'd END
BEGIN NOW Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground END
BEGIN NOW None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist END
BEGIN NOW Went up and waterd all the ground, and each END
BEGIN NOW Plant of the field, which e're it was in the Earth END
BEGIN NOW God made, and every Herb, before it grew END
BEGIN NOW On the green stemm; God saw that it was good: END
BEGIN NOW So Eev'n and Morn recorded the Third Day. END
BEGIN NOW Again th' Almightie spake: Let there be Lights END
BEGIN NOW High in th' expanse of Heaven to divide END
BEGIN NOW The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes, END
BEGIN NOW For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years, END
BEGIN NOW And let them be for Lights as I ordaine END
BEGIN NOW Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav'n END
BEGIN NOW To give Light on the Earth; and it was so. END
BEGIN NOW And God made two great Lights, great for thir use END
BEGIN NOW To Man, the greater to have rule by Day, END
BEGIN NOW The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs, END
BEGIN NOW And set them in the Firmament of Heav'n END
BEGIN NOW To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day END
BEGIN NOW In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night, END
BEGIN NOW And Light from Darkness to divide. God saw, END
BEGIN NOW Surveying his great Work, that it was good: END
BEGIN NOW For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun END
BEGIN NOW A mightie Spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first, END
BEGIN NOW Though of Ethereal Mould: then form'd the Moon END
BEGIN NOW Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs, END
BEGIN NOW And sowd with Starrs the Heav'n thick as a field: END
BEGIN NOW Of Light by farr the greater part he took, END
BEGIN NOW Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac'd END
BEGIN NOW In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive END
BEGIN NOW And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine END
BEGIN NOW Her gather'd beams, great Palace now of Light. END
BEGIN NOW Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs END
BEGIN NOW Repairing, in thir gold'n Urns draw Light, END
BEGIN NOW And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns; END
BEGIN NOW By tincture or reflection they augment END
BEGIN NOW Thir small peculiar, though from human sight END
BEGIN NOW So farr remote, with diminution seen. END
BEGIN NOW First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen, END
BEGIN NOW Regent of Day, and all th' Horizon round END
BEGIN NOW Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run END
BEGIN NOW His Longitude through Heav'ns high rode: the gray END
BEGIN NOW Dawn, and the PLEIADES before him danc'd END
BEGIN NOW Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon, END
BEGIN NOW But opposite in leveld West was set END
BEGIN NOW His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light END
BEGIN NOW From him, for other light she needed none END
BEGIN NOW In that aspect, and still that distance keepes END
BEGIN NOW Till night, then in the East her turn she shines, END
BEGIN NOW Revolvd on Heav'ns great Axle, and her Reign END
BEGIN NOW With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds, END
BEGIN NOW With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer'd END
BEGIN NOW Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd END
BEGIN NOW With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose, END
BEGIN NOW Glad Eevning & glad Morn crownd the fourth day. END
BEGIN NOW And God said, let the Waters generate END
BEGIN NOW Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule: END
BEGIN NOW And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings END
BEGIN NOW Displayd on the op'n Firmament of Heav'n. END
BEGIN NOW And God created the great Whales, and each END
BEGIN NOW Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously END
BEGIN NOW The waters generated by thir kindes, END
BEGIN NOW And every Bird of wing after his kinde; END
BEGIN NOW And saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying, END
BEGIN NOW Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas END
BEGIN NOW And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill; END
BEGIN NOW And let the Fowle be multiply'd on the Earth. END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek & Bay END
BEGIN NOW With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales END
BEGIN NOW Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales END
BEGIN NOW Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft END
BEGIN NOW Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate END
BEGIN NOW Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, & through Groves END
BEGIN NOW Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance END
BEGIN NOW Show to the Sun thir wav'd coats dropt with Gold, END
BEGIN NOW Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend END
BEGIN NOW Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food END
BEGIN NOW In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale, END
BEGIN NOW And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk END
BEGIN NOW Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate END
BEGIN NOW Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan END
BEGIN NOW Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep END
BEGIN NOW Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes, END

BEGIN NOW And freed from intricacies, taught to live, END
BEGIN NOW The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts END

BEGIN NOW But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave END

BEGIN NOW Till warn'd, or by experience taught, she learne, END
BEGIN NOW That not to know at large of things remote END

BEGIN NOW That which before us lies in daily life, END
BEGIN NOW Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume, END
BEGIN NOW Or emptiness, or fond impertinence, END
BEGIN NOW And renders us in things that most concerne END
BEGIN NOW Unpractis'd, unprepar'd, and still to seek. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore from this high pitch let us descend END
BEGIN NOW A lower flight, and speak of things at hand END
BEGIN NOW Useful, whence haply mention may arise END
BEGIN NOW Of somthing not unseasonable to ask END
BEGIN NOW By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign'd. END
BEGIN NOW Thee I have heard relating what was don END

BEGIN NOW And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest END
BEGIN NOW How suttly to detaine thee I devise, END
BEGIN NOW Inviting thee to hear while I relate, END
BEGIN NOW Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply: END
BEGIN NOW For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav'n, END
BEGIN NOW And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare END
BEGIN NOW Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst END
BEGIN NOW And hunger both, from labour, at the houre END
BEGIN NOW Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill, END
BEGIN NOW Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine END
BEGIN NOW Imbu'd, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus RAPHAEL answer'd heav'nly meek. END
BEGIN NOW Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, END
BEGIN NOW Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee END
BEGIN NOW Abundantly his gifts hath also pour'd, END
BEGIN NOW Inward and outward both, his image faire: END
BEGIN NOW Speaking or mute all comliness and grace END
BEGIN NOW Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes. END
BEGIN NOW Nor less think wee in Heav'n of thee on Earth END
BEGIN NOW Then of our fellow servant, and inquire END
BEGIN NOW Gladly into the wayes of God with Man: END
BEGIN NOW For God we see hath honour'd thee, and set END
BEGIN NOW On Man his equal Love: say therefore on; END
BEGIN NOW For I that Day was absent, as befell, END
BEGIN NOW Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, END
BEGIN NOW Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell; END
BEGIN NOW Squar'd in full Legion (such command we had) END
BEGIN NOW To see that none thence issu'd forth a spie, END
BEGIN NOW Or enemie, while God was in his work, END
BEGIN NOW Least hee incenst at such eruption bold, END
BEGIN NOW Destruction with Creation might have mixt. END
BEGIN NOW Not that they durst without his leave attempt, END
BEGIN NOW But us he sends upon his high behests END
BEGIN NOW For state, as Sovran King, and to enure END
BEGIN NOW Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut END
BEGIN NOW The dismal Gates, and barricado'd strong; END
BEGIN NOW But long ere our approaching heard within END
BEGIN NOW Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song, END
BEGIN NOW Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage. END
BEGIN NOW Glad we return'd up to the coasts of Light END
BEGIN NOW Ere Sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in charge. END
BEGIN NOW But thy relation now; for I attend, END
BEGIN NOW Pleas'd with thy words no less then thou with mine. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. END
BEGIN NOW For Man to tell how human Life began END
BEGIN NOW Is hard; for who himself beginning knew? END
BEGIN NOW Desire with thee still longer to converse END
BEGIN NOW Induc'd me. As new wak't from soundest sleep END
BEGIN NOW Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid END
BEGIN NOW In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun END
BEGIN NOW Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture fed. END
BEGIN NOW Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I turnd, END
BEGIN NOW And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till rais'd END
BEGIN NOW By quick instinctive motion up I sprung, END
BEGIN NOW As thitherward endevoring, and upright END
BEGIN NOW Stood on my feet; about me round I saw END
BEGIN NOW Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines, END
BEGIN NOW And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these, END
BEGIN NOW Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or flew, END
BEGIN NOW Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd, END
BEGIN NOW With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd. END
BEGIN NOW My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb END
BEGIN NOW Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran END
BEGIN NOW With supple joints, as lively vigour led: END
BEGIN NOW But who I was, or where, or from what cause, END
BEGIN NOW Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake, END
BEGIN NOW My Tongue obey'd and readily could name END
BEGIN NOW What e're I saw. Thou Sun, said I, faire Light, END
BEGIN NOW And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay, END
BEGIN NOW And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, END
BEGIN NOW Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? END
BEGIN NOW Not of my self; by some great Maker then, END
BEGIN NOW In goodness and in power praeeminent; END
BEGIN NOW Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, END
BEGIN NOW From whom I have that thus I move and live, END
BEGIN NOW And feel that I am happier then I know. END
BEGIN NOW While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither, END
BEGIN NOW From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld END
BEGIN NOW This happie Light, when answer none return'd, END
BEGIN NOW On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours END
BEGIN NOW Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep END
BEGIN NOW First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd END
BEGIN NOW My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought END
BEGIN NOW I then was passing to my former state END
BEGIN NOW Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: END
BEGIN NOW When suddenly stood at my Head a dream, END
BEGIN NOW Whose inward apparition gently mov'd END
BEGIN NOW My Fancy to believe I yet had being, END
BEGIN NOW And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine, END
BEGIN NOW And said, thy Mansion wants thee, ADAM, rise, END
BEGIN NOW First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd END
BEGIN NOW First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide END
BEGIN NOW To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd. END
BEGIN NOW So saying, by the hand he took me rais'd, END
BEGIN NOW And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire END
BEGIN NOW Smooth sliding without step, last led me up END
BEGIN NOW A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine, END
BEGIN NOW A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest Trees END
BEGIN NOW Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw END
BEGIN NOW Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd. Each Tree END
BEGIN NOW Load'n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye END
BEGIN NOW Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden appetite END
BEGIN NOW To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and found END
BEGIN NOW Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream END
BEGIN NOW Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun END

BEGIN NOW Whether his first design be to withdraw END

BEGIN NOW Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side END

BEGIN NOW The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, END
BEGIN NOW Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies, END
BEGIN NOW Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Virgin Majestie of EVE, END
BEGIN NOW As one who loves, and some unkindness meets, END
BEGIN NOW With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd. END
BEGIN NOW Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord, END
BEGIN NOW That such an enemie we have, who seeks END
BEGIN NOW Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne, END
BEGIN NOW And from the parting Angel over-heard END
BEGIN NOW As in a shadie nook I stood behind, END
BEGIN NOW Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours. END
BEGIN NOW But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt END
BEGIN NOW To God or thee, because we have a foe END
BEGIN NOW May tempt it, I expected not to hear. END
BEGIN NOW His violence thou fearst not, being such, END
BEGIN NOW As wee, not capable of death or paine, END
BEGIN NOW Can either not receave, or can repell. END
BEGIN NOW His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs END
BEGIN NOW Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love END
BEGIN NOW Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't; END
BEGIN NOW Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest, END
BEGIN NOW ADAM, misthought of her to thee so dear? END
BEGIN NOW To whom with healing words ADAM reply'd. END
BEGIN NOW Daughter of God and Man, immortal EVE, END
BEGIN NOW For such thou art, from sin and blame entire: END
BEGIN NOW Not diffident of thee do I dissuade END
BEGIN NOW Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid END
BEGIN NOW Th' attempt it self, intended by our Foe. END
BEGIN NOW For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses END
BEGIN NOW The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd END
BEGIN NOW Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff END
BEGIN NOW Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne END
BEGIN NOW And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong, END
BEGIN NOW Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, END
BEGIN NOW If such affront I labour to avert END
BEGIN NOW From thee alone, which on us both at once END
BEGIN NOW The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, END
BEGIN NOW Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light. END
BEGIN NOW Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; END
BEGIN NOW Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce END
BEGIN NOW Angels, nor think superfluous others aid. END
BEGIN NOW I from the influence of thy looks receave END
BEGIN NOW Access in every Vertue, in thy sight END
BEGIN NOW More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were END
BEGIN NOW Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, END
BEGIN NOW Shame to be overcome or over-reacht END
BEGIN NOW Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite. END
BEGIN NOW Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel END
BEGIN NOW When I am present, and thy trial choose END
BEGIN NOW With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd. END
BEGIN NOW So spake domestick ADAM in his care END
BEGIN NOW And Matrimonial Love, but EVE, who thought END
BEGIN NOW Less attributed to her Faith sincere, END
BEGIN NOW Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. END
BEGIN NOW If this be our condition, thus to dwell END
BEGIN NOW In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe, END
BEGIN NOW Suttle or violent, we not endu'd END
BEGIN NOW Single with like defence, wherever met, END
BEGIN NOW How are we happie, still in fear of harm? END
BEGIN NOW But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe END
BEGIN NOW Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem END
BEGIN NOW Of our integritie: his foul esteeme END
BEGIN NOW Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns END
BEGIN NOW Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard END
BEGIN NOW By us? who rather double honour gaine END
BEGIN NOW From his surmise prov'd false, finde peace within, END
BEGIN NOW Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event. END
BEGIN NOW And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid END
BEGIN NOW Alone, without exterior help sustaind? END
BEGIN NOW Let us not then suspect our happie State END
BEGIN NOW Left so imperfet by the Maker wise, END
BEGIN NOW As not secure to single or combin'd. END
BEGIN NOW Fraile is our happiness, if this be so, END
BEGIN NOW And EDEN were no EDEN thus expos'd. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus ADAM fervently repli'd. END
BEGIN NOW O Woman, best are all things as the will END
BEGIN NOW Of God ordaind them, his creating hand END
BEGIN NOW Nothing imperfet or deficient left END
BEGIN NOW Of all that he Created, much less Man, END
BEGIN NOW Or ought that might his happie State secure, END
BEGIN NOW Secure from outward force; within himself END
BEGIN NOW The danger lies, yet lies within his power: END
BEGIN NOW Against his will he can receave no harme. END
BEGIN NOW But God left free the Will, for what obeyes END
BEGIN NOW Reason, is free, and Reason he made right, END
BEGIN NOW But bid her well beware, and still erect, END
BEGIN NOW Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd END
BEGIN NOW She dictate false, and missinforme the Will END
BEGIN NOW To do what God expresly hath forbid. END
BEGIN NOW Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes, END
BEGIN NOW That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me. END
BEGIN NOW Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, END
BEGIN NOW Since Reason not impossibly may meet END
BEGIN NOW Some specious object by the Foe subornd, END
BEGIN NOW And fall into deception unaware, END
BEGIN NOW Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd. END
BEGIN NOW Seek not temptation then, which to avoide END
BEGIN NOW Were better, and most likelie if from mee END
BEGIN NOW Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought. END
BEGIN NOW Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve END
BEGIN NOW First thy obedience; th' other who can know, END
BEGIN NOW Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? END
BEGIN NOW But if thou think, trial unsought may finde END
BEGIN NOW Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst, END
BEGIN NOW Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; END
BEGIN NOW Go in thy native innocence, relie END
BEGIN NOW On what thou hast of vertue, summon all, END
BEGIN NOW For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but EVE END
BEGIN NOW Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd. END
BEGIN NOW With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd END
BEGIN NOW Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words END
BEGIN NOW Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, END
BEGIN NOW May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd, END
BEGIN NOW The willinger I goe, nor much expect END
BEGIN NOW A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek; END
BEGIN NOW So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. END
BEGIN NOW Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand END
BEGIN NOW Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light END
BEGIN NOW OREAD or DRYAD, or of DELIA's Traine, END
BEGIN NOW Betook her to the Groves, but DELIA's self END
BEGIN NOW In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport, END
BEGIN NOW Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd, END
BEGIN NOW But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude, END
BEGIN NOW Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought, END
BEGIN NOW To PALES, or POMONA, thus adornd, END
BEGIN NOW Likest she seemd, POMONA when she fled END
BEGIN NOW VERTUMNUS, or to CERES in her Prime, END
BEGIN NOW Yet Virgin of PROSERPINA from JOVE. END
BEGIN NOW Her long with ardent look his EYE pursu'd END
BEGIN NOW Delighted, but desiring more her stay. END
BEGIN NOW Oft he to her his charge of quick returne, END
BEGIN NOW Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd END
BEGIN NOW To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre, END
BEGIN NOW And all things in best order to invite END
BEGIN NOW Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose. END
BEGIN NOW O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless EVE, END
BEGIN NOW Of thy presum'd return! event perverse! END
BEGIN NOW Thou never from that houre in Paradise END
BEGIN NOW Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose; END
BEGIN NOW Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades END
BEGIN NOW Waited with hellish rancor imminent END
BEGIN NOW To intercept thy way, or send thee back END
BEGIN NOW For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend, END
BEGIN NOW Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come, END
BEGIN NOW And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde END
BEGIN NOW The onely two of Mankinde, but in them END
BEGIN NOW The whole included Race, his purposd prey. END
BEGIN NOW In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft END
BEGIN NOW Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay, END
BEGIN NOW Thir tendance or Plantation for delight, END
BEGIN NOW By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet END
BEGIN NOW He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find END
BEGIN NOW EVE separate, he wish'd, but not with hope END
BEGIN NOW Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish, END
BEGIN NOW Beyond his hope, EVE separate he spies, END
BEGIN NOW Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood, END
BEGIN NOW Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round END
BEGIN NOW About her glowd, oft stooping to support END
BEGIN NOW Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay END
BEGIN NOW Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold, END
BEGIN NOW Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies END
BEGIN NOW Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while, END
BEGIN NOW Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour, END
BEGIN NOW From her best prop so farr, and storn so nigh. END
BEGIN NOW Neererhe drew, and many a walk travers'd END
BEGIN NOW Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme, END
BEGIN NOW Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen END
BEGIN NOW Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours END
BEGIN NOW Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of EVE: END
BEGIN NOW Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd END
BEGIN NOW Or of reviv'd ADONIS, or renownd END
BEGIN NOW ALCINOUS, host of old LAERTES Son, END
BEGIN NOW Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King END
BEGIN NOW Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more. END
BEGIN NOW As one who long in populous City pent, END
BEGIN NOW Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire, END
BEGIN NOW Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe END
BEGIN NOW Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes END
BEGIN NOW Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, END
BEGIN NOW The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine, END
BEGIN NOW Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; END
BEGIN NOW If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass, END
BEGIN NOW What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, END
BEGIN NOW She most, and in her look summs all Delight. END
BEGIN NOW Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold END
BEGIN NOW This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of EVE END
BEGIN NOW Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme END
BEGIN NOW Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, END
BEGIN NOW Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire END
BEGIN NOW Of gesture or lest action overawd END
BEGIN NOW His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd END
BEGIN NOW His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: END
BEGIN NOW That space the Evil one abstracted stood END
BEGIN NOW From his own evil, and for the time remaind END
BEGIN NOW Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd, END
BEGIN NOW Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; END
BEGIN NOW But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes, END
BEGIN NOW Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight, END
BEGIN NOW And tortures him now more, the more he sees END
BEGIN NOW Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon END
BEGIN NOW Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts END
BEGIN NOW Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. END
BEGIN NOW Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet END
BEGIN NOW Compulsion thus transported to forget END
BEGIN NOW What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope END
BEGIN NOW Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste END
BEGIN NOW Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, END
BEGIN NOW Save what is in destroying, other joy END
BEGIN NOW To me is lost. Then let me not let pass END
BEGIN NOW Occasion which now smiles, behold alone END
BEGIN NOW The Woman, opportune to all attempts, END
BEGIN NOW Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh, END
BEGIN NOW Whose higher intellectual more I shun, END
BEGIN NOW And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb END
BEGIN NOW Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould, END
BEGIN NOW Foe not informidable, exempt from wound, END
BEGIN NOW I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine END
BEGIN NOW Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n. END
BEGIN NOW Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods, END
BEGIN NOW Not terrible, though terrour be in Love END
BEGIN NOW And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate, END
BEGIN NOW Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd, END
BEGIN NOW The way which to her ruin now I tend. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd END
BEGIN NOW In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward EVE END
BEGIN NOW Address'd his way, not with indented wave, END
BEGIN NOW Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare, END
BEGIN NOW Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd END
BEGIN NOW Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head END
BEGIN NOW Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes; END
BEGIN NOW With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect END
BEGIN NOW Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass END
BEGIN NOW Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape, END
BEGIN NOW And lovely, never since of Serpent kind END
BEGIN NOW Lovelier, not those that in ILLYRIA chang'd END
BEGIN NOW HERMIONE and CADMUS, or the God END
BEGIN NOW In EPIDAURUS; nor to which transformd END
BEGIN NOW Hee with OLYMPIAS, this with her who bore END
BEGIN NOW SCIPIO the highth of ROME. With tract oblique END
BEGIN NOW At first, as one who sought access, but feard END
BEGIN NOW To interrupt, side-long he works his way. END
BEGIN NOW As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought END
BEGIN NOW Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind END
BEGIN NOW Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile; END
BEGIN NOW So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine END
BEGIN NOW Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of EVE, END
BEGIN NOW To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound END
BEGIN NOW Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd END
BEGIN NOW To such disport before her through the Field, END
BEGIN NOW From every Beast, more duteous at her call, END
BEGIN NOW Then at CIRCEAN call the Herd disguis'd. END
BEGIN NOW Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood; END
BEGIN NOW But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd END
BEGIN NOW His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck, END
BEGIN NOW Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod. END
BEGIN NOW The Eye of EVE to mark his play; he glad END
BEGIN NOW Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue END
BEGIN NOW Organic, or impulse of vocal Air, END
BEGIN NOW His fraudulent temptation thus began. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps END
BEGIN NOW Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm END
BEGIN NOW Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain, END
BEGIN NOW Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze END
BEGIN NOW Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard END
BEGIN NOW Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd. END
BEGIN NOW Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire, END
BEGIN NOW Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine END
BEGIN NOW By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore END
BEGIN NOW With ravishment beheld, there best beheld END
BEGIN NOW Where universally admir'd; but here END
BEGIN NOW In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among, END
BEGIN NOW Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne END
BEGIN NOW Half what in thee is fair, one man except, END
BEGIN NOW Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen END
BEGIN NOW A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd END
BEGIN NOW By Angels numberless, thy daily Train. END
BEGIN NOW So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd; END
BEGIN NOW Into the Heart of EVE his words made way, END
BEGIN NOW Though at the voice much marveling; at length END
BEGIN NOW Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake. END
BEGIN NOW What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc't END
BEGIN NOW By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest? END
BEGIN NOW The first at lest of these I thought deni'd END
BEGIN NOW To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day END
BEGIN NOW Created mute to all articulat sound; END
BEGIN NOW The latter I demurre, for in thir looks END
BEGIN NOW Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers. END
BEGIN NOW Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field END
BEGIN NOW I knew, but not with human voice endu'd; END
BEGIN NOW Redouble then this miracle, and say, END
BEGIN NOW How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how END
BEGIN NOW To me so friendly grown above the rest END
BEGIN NOW Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? END
BEGIN NOW Say, for such wonder claims attention due. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd. END
BEGIN NOW Empress of this fair World, resplendent EVE, END
BEGIN NOW Easie to mee it is to tell thee all END
BEGIN NOW What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: END
BEGIN NOW I was at first as other Beasts that graze END
BEGIN NOW The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low, END
BEGIN NOW As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd END
BEGIN NOW Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high: END
BEGIN NOW Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd END
BEGIN NOW A goodly Tree farr distant to behold END
BEGIN NOW Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, END
BEGIN NOW Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze; END
BEGIN NOW When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n, END
BEGIN NOW Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense END
BEGIN NOW Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats END
BEGIN NOW Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn, END
BEGIN NOW Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play. END
BEGIN NOW To satisfie the sharp desire I had END
BEGIN NOW Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd END
BEGIN NOW Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, END
BEGIN NOW Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent END
BEGIN NOW Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene. END
BEGIN NOW About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon, END
BEGIN NOW For high from ground the branches would require END
BEGIN NOW Thy utmost reach or ADAMS: Round the Tree END
BEGIN NOW All other Beasts that saw, with like desire END
BEGIN NOW Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. END
BEGIN NOW Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung END
BEGIN NOW Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill END
BEGIN NOW I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour END
BEGIN NOW At Feed or Fountain never had I found. END
BEGIN NOW Sated at length, ere long I might perceave END
BEGIN NOW Strange alteration in me, to degree END
BEGIN NOW Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech END
BEGIN NOW Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind. END
BEGIN NOW Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep END
BEGIN NOW I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind END
BEGIN NOW Considerd all things visible in Heav'n, END
BEGIN NOW Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good; END
BEGIN NOW But all that fair and good in thy Divine END
BEGIN NOW Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray END
BEGIN NOW United I beheld; no Fair to thine END
BEGIN NOW Equivalent or second, which compel'd END
BEGIN NOW Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come END
BEGIN NOW And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd END
BEGIN NOW Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. END
BEGIN NOW So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and EVE END
BEGIN NOW Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd. END
BEGIN NOW Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt END
BEGIN NOW The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd: END
BEGIN NOW But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far? END
BEGIN NOW For many are the Trees of God that grow END
BEGIN NOW In Paradise, and various, yet unknown END
BEGIN NOW To us, in such abundance lies our choice, END
BEGIN NOW As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht, END
BEGIN NOW Still hanging incorruptible, till men END
BEGIN NOW Grow up to thir provision, and more hands END
BEGIN NOW Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad. END
BEGIN NOW Empress, the way is readie, and not long, END
BEGIN NOW Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past END
BEGIN NOW Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept END
BEGIN NOW My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon. END
BEGIN NOW Lead then, said EVE. Hee leading swiftly rowld END
BEGIN NOW In tangles, and make intricate seem strait, END
BEGIN NOW To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy END
BEGIN NOW Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire END
BEGIN NOW Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night END
BEGIN NOW Condenses, and the cold invirons round, END
BEGIN NOW Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame, END
BEGIN NOW Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends, END
BEGIN NOW Hovering and blazing with delusive Light, END
BEGIN NOW Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way END
BEGIN NOW To Boggs and Mires, & oft through Pond or Poole, END
BEGIN NOW There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr. END
BEGIN NOW So glister'd the dire Snake and into fraud END
BEGIN NOW Led EVE our credulous Mother, to the Tree END
BEGIN NOW Of prohibition, root of all our woe; END
BEGIN NOW Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. END
BEGIN NOW Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither, END
BEGIN NOW Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess, END
BEGIN NOW The credit of whose vertue rest with thee, END
BEGIN NOW Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. END
BEGIN NOW But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch; END
BEGIN NOW God so commanded, and left that Command END
BEGIN NOW Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live END
BEGIN NOW Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit END
BEGIN NOW Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate, END
BEGIN NOW Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire? END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus EVE yet sinless. Of the Fruit END
BEGIN NOW Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate, END
BEGIN NOW But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst END
BEGIN NOW The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate END
BEGIN NOW Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. END
BEGIN NOW She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold END

BEGIN NOW Hast thou not wonderd, ADAM, at my stay? END
BEGIN NOW Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd END
BEGIN NOW Thy presence, agonie of love till now END
BEGIN NOW Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more END
BEGIN NOW Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought, END
BEGIN NOW The paine of absence from thy sight. But strange END
BEGIN NOW Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare: END
BEGIN NOW This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree END
BEGIN NOW Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown END
BEGIN NOW Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect END
BEGIN NOW To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste; END
BEGIN NOW And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise, END
BEGIN NOW Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying, END
BEGIN NOW Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become, END
BEGIN NOW Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth END
BEGIN NOW Endu'd with human voice and human sense, END
BEGIN NOW Reasoning to admiration, and with mee END
BEGIN NOW Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I END
BEGIN NOW Have also tasted, and have also found END
BEGIN NOW Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart, END
BEGIN NOW And growing up to Godhead; which for thee END
BEGIN NOW Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. END
BEGIN NOW For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss, END
BEGIN NOW Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon. END
BEGIN NOW Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot END
BEGIN NOW May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love; END
BEGIN NOW Least thou not tasting, different degree END
BEGIN NOW Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce END
BEGIN NOW Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. END
BEGIN NOW Thus EVE with Countnance blithe her storie told; END
BEGIN NOW But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd. END
BEGIN NOW On th' other side, ADAM, soon as he heard END
BEGIN NOW The fatal Trespass don by EVE, amaz'd, END
BEGIN NOW Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill END
BEGIN NOW Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd; END
BEGIN NOW From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for EVE END
BEGIN NOW Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed: END
BEGIN NOW Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length END
BEGIN NOW First to himself he inward silence broke. END
BEGIN NOW O fairest of Creation, last and best END
BEGIN NOW Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell'd END
BEGIN NOW Whatever can to fight or thought be found, END
BEGIN NOW Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! END
BEGIN NOW How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, END
BEGIN NOW Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote? END
BEGIN NOW Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress END
BEGIN NOW The strict forbiddance, how to violate END
BEGIN NOW The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud END
BEGIN NOW Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown, END
BEGIN NOW And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee END
BEGIN NOW Certain my resolution is to Die; END
BEGIN NOW How can I live without thee, how forgoe END
BEGIN NOW Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd, END
BEGIN NOW To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn? END
BEGIN NOW Should God create another EVE, and I END
BEGIN NOW Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee END
BEGIN NOW Would never from my heart; no no, I feel END
BEGIN NOW The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh, END
BEGIN NOW Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State END
BEGIN NOW Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. END
BEGIN NOW So having said, as one from sad dismay END
BEGIN NOW Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd END
BEGIN NOW Submitting to what seemd remediless, END

BEGIN NOW Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous EVE, END
BEGIN NOW And peril great provok't, who thus hast dar'd END
BEGIN NOW Had it bin onely coveting to Eye END
BEGIN NOW That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence, END
BEGIN NOW Much more to taste it under banne to touch. END
BEGIN NOW But past who can recall, or don undoe? END
BEGIN NOW Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact END
BEGIN NOW Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit, END
BEGIN NOW Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first END
BEGIN NOW Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes; END
BEGIN NOW Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives, END
BEGIN NOW Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man END
BEGIN NOW Higher degree of Life, inducement strong END
BEGIN NOW To us, as likely tasting to attaine END
BEGIN NOW Proportional ascent, which cannot be END
BEGIN NOW But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods. END
BEGIN NOW Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, END
BEGIN NOW Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy END
BEGIN NOW Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high, END
BEGIN NOW Set over all his Works, which in our Fall, END
BEGIN NOW For us created, needs with us must faile, END
BEGIN NOW Dependent made; so God shall uncreate, END
BEGIN NOW Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose, END
BEGIN NOW Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power END
BEGIN NOW Creation could repeate, yet would be loath END
BEGIN NOW Us to abolish, least the Adversary END
BEGIN NOW Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God END
BEGIN NOW Most Favors, who can please him long? Mee first END
BEGIN NOW He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next? END
BEGIN NOW Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe. END
BEGIN NOW However I with thee have fixt my Lot, END
BEGIN NOW Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death END
BEGIN NOW Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life; END
BEGIN NOW So forcible within my heart I feel END
BEGIN NOW The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne, END
BEGIN NOW My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; END
BEGIN NOW Our State cannot be severd, we are one, END
BEGIN NOW One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. END
BEGIN NOW So ADAM, and thus EVE to him repli'd. END
BEGIN NOW O glorious trial of exceeding Love, END
BEGIN NOW Illustrious evidence, example high! END
BEGIN NOW Ingaging me to emulate, but short END
BEGIN NOW Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine, END
BEGIN NOW ADAM, from whose deare side I boast me sprung, END
BEGIN NOW And gladly of our Union heare thee speak, END
BEGIN NOW One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff END
BEGIN NOW This day affords, declaring thee resolvd, END
BEGIN NOW Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread END
BEGIN NOW Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare, END
BEGIN NOW To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime, END
BEGIN NOW If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit, END
BEGIN NOW Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, END
BEGIN NOW Direct, or by occasion hath presented END
BEGIN NOW This happie trial of thy Love, which else END
BEGIN NOW So eminently never had bin known. END
BEGIN NOW Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue END
BEGIN NOW This my attempt, I would sustain alone END
BEGIN NOW The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die END
BEGIN NOW Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact END
BEGIN NOW Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd END
BEGIN NOW Remarkably so late of thy so true, END
BEGIN NOW So faithful Love unequald; but I feel END
BEGIN NOW Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life END
BEGIN NOW Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes, END
BEGIN NOW Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before END
BEGIN NOW Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. END
BEGIN NOW On my experience, ADAM, freely taste, END
BEGIN NOW And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. END
BEGIN NOW So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy END
BEGIN NOW Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love END
BEGIN NOW Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr END
BEGIN NOW Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death. END
BEGIN NOW In recompence (for such compliance bad END
BEGIN NOW Such recompence best merits) from the bough END
BEGIN NOW She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit END
BEGIN NOW With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat END
BEGIN NOW Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd, END
BEGIN NOW But fondly overcome with Femal charm. END
BEGIN NOW Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again END
BEGIN NOW In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan, END
BEGIN NOW Skie lowr'd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops END
BEGIN NOW Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin END
BEGIN NOW Original; while ADAM took no thought, END
BEGIN NOW Eating his fill, nor EVE to iterate END
BEGIN NOW Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe END
BEGIN NOW Him with her lov'd societie, that now END
BEGIN NOW As with new Wine intoxicated both END
BEGIN NOW They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel END
BEGIN NOW Divinitie within them breeding wings END
BEGIN NOW Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit END
BEGIN NOW Farr other operation first displaid, END
BEGIN NOW Carnal desire enflaming, hee on EVE END
BEGIN NOW Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him END
BEGIN NOW As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne: END
BEGIN NOW Till ADAM thus 'gan EVE to dalliance move. END
BEGIN NOW EVE, now I see thou art exact of taste, END
BEGIN NOW And elegant, of Sapience no small part, END
BEGIN NOW Since to each meaning savour we apply, END
BEGIN NOW And Palate call judicious; I the praise END
BEGIN NOW Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd. END
BEGIN NOW Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd END

BEGIN NOW Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree. END
BEGIN NOW So said he, and forbore not glance or toy END
BEGIN NOW Of amorous intent, well understood END
BEGIN NOW Of EVE, whose Eye darted contagious Fire. END
BEGIN NOW Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank, END
BEGIN NOW Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd END
BEGIN NOW He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch, END
BEGIN NOW And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap. END
BEGIN NOW There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport END
BEGIN NOW Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale, END
BEGIN NOW The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep END
BEGIN NOW Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play. END
BEGIN NOW Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit, END
BEGIN NOW That with exhilerating vapour bland END
BEGIN NOW About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers END
BEGIN NOW Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep END
BEGIN NOW Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams END
BEGIN NOW Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose END
BEGIN NOW As from unrest, and each the other viewing, END
BEGIN NOW Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds END
BEGIN NOW How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile END
BEGIN NOW Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon, END
BEGIN NOW Just confidence, and native righteousness, END
BEGIN NOW And honour from about them, naked left END
BEGIN NOW To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe END
BEGIN NOW Uncover'd more. So rose the DANITE strong END
BEGIN NOW HERCULEAN SAMSON from the Harlot-lap END
BEGIN NOW Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare END
BEGIN NOW Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face END
BEGIN NOW Confounded long they sate, as struck'n mute, END
BEGIN NOW Till ADAM, though not less then EVE abasht, END
BEGIN NOW At length gave utterance to these words constraind. END
BEGIN NOW O EVE, in evil hour thou didst give care END
BEGIN NOW To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught END
BEGIN NOW To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall, END
BEGIN NOW False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes END
BEGIN NOW Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know END
BEGIN NOW Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got, END
BEGIN NOW Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know, END
BEGIN NOW Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void, END
BEGIN NOW Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind, END
BEGIN NOW And in our Faces evident the signes END
BEGIN NOW Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store; END
BEGIN NOW Even shame, the last of evils; of the first END
BEGIN NOW Be sure then. How shall I behold the face END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy END
BEGIN NOW And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes END
BEGIN NOW Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze END
BEGIN NOW Insufferably bright. O might I here END
BEGIN NOW In solitude live savage, in some glad END
BEGIN NOW Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable END
BEGIN NOW To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad, END
BEGIN NOW And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines, END
BEGIN NOW Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs END
BEGIN NOW Hide me, where I may never see them more. END
BEGIN NOW But let us now, as in bad plight, devise END
BEGIN NOW What best may for the present serve to hide END
BEGIN NOW The Parts of each from other, that seem most END
BEGIN NOW To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen, END
BEGIN NOW Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd, END
BEGIN NOW And girded on our loyns, may cover round END
BEGIN NOW Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame, END
BEGIN NOW There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. END
BEGIN NOW So counsel'd hee, and both together went END
BEGIN NOW Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose END
BEGIN NOW The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd, END
BEGIN NOW But such as at this day to INDIANS known END
BEGIN NOW In MALABAR or DECAN spreds her Armes END
BEGIN NOW Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground END
BEGIN NOW The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow END

BEGIN NOW High overarch't, and echoing Walks between; END
BEGIN NOW There oft the INDIAN Herdsman shunning heate END
BEGIN NOW Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds END
BEGIN NOW At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves END
BEGIN NOW They gatherd, broad as AMAZONIAN Targe, END
BEGIN NOW And with what skill they had, together sowd, END
BEGIN NOW To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide END
BEGIN NOW Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike END
BEGIN NOW To that first naked Glorie. Such of late END
BEGIN NOW COLUMBUS found th' AMERICAN to girt END
BEGIN NOW With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde END
BEGIN NOW Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores. END
BEGIN NOW Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part END
BEGIN NOW Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind, END
BEGIN NOW They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares END
BEGIN NOW Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within END
BEGIN NOW Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate, END
BEGIN NOW Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore END

BEGIN NOW Which when the Lord God heard, without delay END
BEGIN NOW To Judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd END
BEGIN NOW Serpent though brute, unable to transferre END
BEGIN NOW The Guilt on him who made him instrument END
BEGIN NOW Of mischief, and polluted from the end END
BEGIN NOW Of his Creation; justly then accurst, END
BEGIN NOW As vitiated in Nature: more to know END
BEGIN NOW Concern'd not Man (since he no further knew) END
BEGIN NOW Nor alter'd his offence; yet God at last END
BEGIN NOW To Satan first in sin his doom apply'd, END
BEGIN NOW Though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best: END
BEGIN NOW And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. END
BEGIN NOW Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst END
BEGIN NOW Above all Cattel, each Beast of the Field; END
BEGIN NOW Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe, END
BEGIN NOW And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life. END
BEGIN NOW Between Thee and the Woman I will put END

BEGIN NOW Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel. END
BEGIN NOW So spake this Oracle, then verifi'd END
BEGIN NOW When JESUS son of MARY second EVE, END
BEGIN NOW Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav'n, END
BEGIN NOW Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave END
BEGIN NOW Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht END
BEGIN NOW In open shew, and with ascention bright END

BEGIN NOW Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie END
BEGIN NOW By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring END
BEGIN NOW In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will END
BEGIN NOW Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. END
BEGIN NOW On ADAM last thus judgement he pronounc'd. END
BEGIN NOW Because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy Wife, END
BEGIN NOW And eaten of the Tree concerning which END
BEGIN NOW I charg'd thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof, END
BEGIN NOW Curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow END
BEGIN NOW Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life; END

BEGIN NOW Till thou return unto the ground, for thou END
BEGIN NOW Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth, END
BEGIN NOW For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. END
BEGIN NOW So judg'd he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent, END
BEGIN NOW And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day END
BEGIN NOW Remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood END
BEGIN NOW Before him naked to the aire, that now END
BEGIN NOW Must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin END
BEGIN NOW Thenceforth the forme of servant to assume, END
BEGIN NOW As when he wash'd his servants feet, so now END
BEGIN NOW As Father of his Familie he clad END
BEGIN NOW Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain, END

BEGIN NOW All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man END
BEGIN NOW Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. END
BEGIN NOW Meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on Earth, END

BEGIN NOW Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, END

BEGIN NOW The savour of Death from all things there that live: END
BEGIN NOW Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest END
BEGIN NOW Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. END
BEGIN NOW So saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell END
BEGIN NOW Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock END

BEGIN NOW Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish END
BEGIN NOW With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave, END
BEGIN NOW Or in some other dismal place, who knows END

BEGIN NOW Can he make deathless Death? that were to make END
BEGIN NOW Strange contradiction, which to God himself END

BEGIN NOW But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd, END
BEGIN NOW Not to do onely, but to will the same END
BEGIN NOW With me? how can they acquitted stand END
BEGIN NOW In sight of God? Him after all Disputes END
BEGIN NOW Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain END

BEGIN NOW But to my own conviction: first and last END
BEGIN NOW On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring END

BEGIN NOW So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support END

BEGIN NOW O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears END
BEGIN NOW And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which END
BEGIN NOW I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd! END
BEGIN NOW Thus ADAM to himself lamented loud END
BEGIN NOW Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell, END
BEGIN NOW Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air END
BEGIN NOW Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, END
BEGIN NOW Which to his evil Conscience represented END
BEGIN NOW All things with double terror: On the ground END
BEGIN NOW Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft END
BEGIN NOW Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd END
BEGIN NOW The day of his offence. Why comes not Death, END
BEGIN NOW Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke END
BEGIN NOW To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, END
BEGIN NOW Justice Divine not hast'n to be just? END
BEGIN NOW But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine END
BEGIN NOW Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. END
BEGIN NOW VVith other echo farr I taught your Shades END

BEGIN NOW VVhom thus afflicted when sad EVE beheld, END
BEGIN NOW Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, END
BEGIN NOW Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd: END
BEGIN NOW But her with stern regard he thus repell'd. END
BEGIN NOW Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best END
BEGIN NOW Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false END
BEGIN NOW And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, END
BEGIN NOW Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew END
BEGIN NOW Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended END
BEGIN NOW To hellish falshood, snare them. But for thee END
BEGIN NOW I had persisted happie, had not thy pride END
BEGIN NOW And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe, END
BEGIN NOW Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd END
BEGIN NOW Not to be trusted, longing to be seen END
BEGIN NOW Though by the Devil himself, him overweening END
BEGIN NOW To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting END
BEGIN NOW Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee, END
BEGIN NOW To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise, END
BEGIN NOW Constant, mature, proof against all assaults, END
BEGIN NOW And understood not all was but a shew END
BEGIN NOW Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib END
BEGIN NOW Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, END
BEGIN NOW More to the part sinister from me drawn, END
BEGIN NOW Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie END
BEGIN NOW To my just number found. O why did God, END
BEGIN NOW Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n END
BEGIN NOW With Spirits Masculine, create at last END
BEGIN NOW This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect END
BEGIN NOW Of Nature, and not fill the World at once END
BEGIN NOW With Men as Angels without Feminine, END
BEGIN NOW Or find some other way to generate END
BEGIN NOW Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n, END
BEGIN NOW And more that shall befall, innumerable END
BEGIN NOW Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares, END
BEGIN NOW And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either END
BEGIN NOW He never shall find out fit Mate, but such END
BEGIN NOW As some misfortune brings him, or mistake, END
BEGIN NOW Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain END
BEGIN NOW Through her perverseness, but shall see her gaind END
BEGIN NOW By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld END
BEGIN NOW By Parents, or his happiest choice too late END
BEGIN NOW Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound END
BEGIN NOW To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame: END
BEGIN NOW Which infinite calamitie shall cause END
BEGIN NOW To humane life, and houshold peace confound. END
BEGIN NOW He added not, and from her turn'd, but EVE END
BEGIN NOW Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas'd not flowing, END
BEGIN NOW And tresses all disorderd, at his feet END
BEGIN NOW Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught END
BEGIN NOW His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. END
BEGIN NOW Forsake me not thus, ADAM, witness Heav'n END
BEGIN NOW What love sincere, and reverence in my heart END
BEGIN NOW I beare thee, and unweeting have offended, END
BEGIN NOW Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant END
BEGIN NOW I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, END

BEGIN NOW On me already lost, mee then thy self END
BEGIN NOW More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou END
BEGIN NOW Against God onely, I against God and thee, END
BEGIN NOW And to the place of judgement will return, END
BEGIN NOW There with my cries importune Heaven, that all END

BEGIN NOW To whom thus EVE with sad demeanour meek. END
BEGIN NOW Ill worthie I such title should belong END

BEGIN NOW Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content. END
BEGIN NOW So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd EVE, but Fate END
BEGIN NOW Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest END
BEGIN NOW On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd END
BEGIN NOW After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight END
BEGIN NOW The Bird of JOVE, stoopt from his aerie tour, END

BEGIN NOW Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews END
BEGIN NOW Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn END
BEGIN NOW Us haply too secure of our discharge END
BEGIN NOW From penaltie, because from death releast END

BEGIN NOW To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense END
BEGIN NOW More terrible at th' entrance then within. END

BEGIN NOW Inductive mainly to the sin of EVE. END

BEGIN NOW But is there yet no other way, besides END

BEGIN NOW There is, said MICHAEL, if thou well observe END
BEGIN NOW The rule of not too much, by temperance taught END
BEGIN NOW In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence END
BEGIN NOW Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, END
BEGIN NOW Till many years over thy head return: END
BEGIN NOW So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop END
BEGIN NOW Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease END
BEGIN NOW Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: END
BEGIN NOW This is old age; but then thou must outlive END
BEGIN NOW Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change END
BEGIN NOW To witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then END
BEGIN NOW Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, END
BEGIN NOW To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth END
BEGIN NOW Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne END
BEGIN NOW A melancholly damp of cold and dry END

BEGIN NOW The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong END
BEGIN NOW Life much, bent rather how I may be quit END
BEGIN NOW Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, END
BEGIN NOW Which I must keep till my appointed day END
BEGIN NOW Of rendring up. MICHAEL to him repli'd. END
BEGIN NOW Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst END
BEGIN NOW Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n: END
BEGIN NOW And now prepare thee for another sight. END
BEGIN NOW He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon END
BEGIN NOW Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds END
BEGIN NOW Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound END
BEGIN NOW Of Instruments that made melodious chime END
BEGIN NOW Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd END
BEGIN NOW Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch END
BEGIN NOW Instinct through all proportions low and high END
BEGIN NOW Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue. END
BEGIN NOW In other part stood one who at the Forge END
BEGIN NOW Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass END
BEGIN NOW Had melted (whether found where casual fire END
BEGIN NOW Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, END
BEGIN NOW Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot END
BEGIN NOW To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream END
BEGIN NOW From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind END
BEGIN NOW Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd END
BEGIN NOW First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought END
BEGIN NOW Fulfil or grav'n in mettle. After these, END
BEGIN NOW But on the hether side a different sort END
BEGIN NOW From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, END
BEGIN NOW Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise END
BEGIN NOW Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent END
BEGIN NOW To worship God aright, and know his works END
BEGIN NOW Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve END
BEGIN NOW Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain END
BEGIN NOW Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold END
BEGIN NOW A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay END
BEGIN NOW In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung END
BEGIN NOW Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: END
BEGIN NOW The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes END
BEGIN NOW Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net END
BEGIN NOW Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose; END
BEGIN NOW And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star END
BEGIN NOW Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat END
BEGIN NOW They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke END
BEGIN NOW Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't; END
BEGIN NOW With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. END
BEGIN NOW Such happy interview and fair event END
BEGIN NOW Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, END
BEGIN NOW And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart END
BEGIN NOW Of ADAM, soon enclin'd to admit delight, END
BEGIN NOW The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd. END
BEGIN NOW True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, END
BEGIN NOW Much better seems this Vision, and more hope END
BEGIN NOW Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; END
BEGIN NOW Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, END
BEGIN NOW Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus MICHAEL. Judg not what is best END
BEGIN NOW By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, END
BEGIN NOW Created, as thou art, to nobler end END
BEGIN NOW Holie and pure, conformitie divine. END
BEGIN NOW Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents END
BEGIN NOW Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race END
BEGIN NOW Who slew his Brother; studious they appere END
BEGIN NOW Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, END
BEGIN NOW Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit END
BEGIN NOW Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none. END
BEGIN NOW Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; END
BEGIN NOW For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd END
BEGIN NOW Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, END
BEGIN NOW Yet empty of all good wherein consists END
BEGIN NOW Womans domestic honour and chief praise; END
BEGIN NOW Bred onely and completed to the taste END
BEGIN NOW Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance, END
BEGIN NOW To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. END
BEGIN NOW To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives END
BEGIN NOW Religious titl'd them the Sons of God, END
BEGIN NOW Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame END
BEGIN NOW Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles END
BEGIN NOW Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, END
BEGIN NOW (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which END
BEGIN NOW The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus ADAM of short joy bereft. END
BEGIN NOW O pittie and shame, that they who to live well END
BEGIN NOW Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread END
BEGIN NOW Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! END
BEGIN NOW But still I see the tenor of Mans woe END
BEGIN NOW Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. END
BEGIN NOW From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, END
BEGIN NOW Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place END
BEGIN NOW By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd. END
BEGIN NOW But now prepare thee for another Scene. END
BEGIN NOW He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred END
BEGIN NOW Before him, Towns, and rural works between, END
BEGIN NOW Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, END
BEGIN NOW Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, END
BEGIN NOW Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; END
BEGIN NOW Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, END
BEGIN NOW Single or in Array of Battel rang'd END
BEGIN NOW Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; END
BEGIN NOW One way a Band select from forage drives END
BEGIN NOW A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine END
BEGIN NOW From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, END
BEGIN NOW Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, END
BEGIN NOW Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, END
BEGIN NOW But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray; END
BEGIN NOW With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; END
BEGIN NOW Where Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies END
BEGIN NOW With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field END
BEGIN NOW Deserted: Others to a Citie strong END
BEGIN NOW Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, END
BEGIN NOW Assaulting; others from the Wall defend END
BEGIN NOW With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; END
BEGIN NOW On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. END
BEGIN NOW In other part the scepter'd Haralds call END
BEGIN NOW To Council in the Citie Gates: anon END
BEGIN NOW Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, END
BEGIN NOW Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon END
BEGIN NOW In factious opposition, till at last END
BEGIN NOW Of middle Age one rising, eminent END
BEGIN NOW In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, END
BEGIN NOW And Judgement from above: him old and young END
BEGIN NOW Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands, END
BEGIN NOW Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence END
BEGIN NOW Unseen amid the throng: so violence END
BEGIN NOW Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. END
BEGIN NOW ADAM was all in tears, and to his guide END
BEGIN NOW Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, END
BEGIN NOW Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death END
BEGIN NOW Inhumanly to men, and multiply END
BEGIN NOW Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew END
BEGIN NOW His Brother; for of whom such massacher END
BEGIN NOW Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? END
BEGIN NOW But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n END
BEGIN NOW Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost? END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus MICHAEL; These are the product END
BEGIN NOW Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st; END
BEGIN NOW Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves END
BEGIN NOW Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, END
BEGIN NOW Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. END
BEGIN NOW Such were these Giants, men of high renown; END
BEGIN NOW For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd, END
BEGIN NOW And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd; END
BEGIN NOW To overcome in Battel, and subdue END
BEGIN NOW Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite END
BEGIN NOW Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch END
BEGIN NOW Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done END
BEGIN NOW Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours, END
BEGIN NOW Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth, END
BEGIN NOW And what most merits fame in silence hid. END
BEGIN NOW But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst END
BEGIN NOW The onely righteous in a World perverse, END
BEGIN NOW And therefore hated, therefore so beset END
BEGIN NOW With Foes for daring single to be just, END
BEGIN NOW And utter odious Truth, that God would come END
BEGIN NOW To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High END
BEGIN NOW Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds END
BEGIN NOW Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God END
BEGIN NOW High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss, END
BEGIN NOW Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward END
BEGIN NOW Awaits the good, the rest what punishment; END
BEGIN NOW Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. END
BEGIN NOW He look'd, & saw the face of things quite chang'd; END
BEGIN NOW The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar, END
BEGIN NOW All now was turn'd to jollitie and game, END
BEGIN NOW To luxurie and riot, feast and dance, END
BEGIN NOW Marrying or prostituting, as befell, END
BEGIN NOW Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire END
BEGIN NOW Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. END
BEGIN NOW At length a Reverend Sire among them came, END
BEGIN NOW And of thir doings great dislike declar'd, END
BEGIN NOW And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft END
BEGIN NOW Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met, END
BEGIN NOW Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd END
BEGIN NOW In prison under Judgements imminent: END
BEGIN NOW But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd END
BEGIN NOW Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off; END
BEGIN NOW Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall, END
BEGIN NOW Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk, END
BEGIN NOW Measur'd by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth, END
BEGIN NOW Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore END
BEGIN NOW Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large END
BEGIN NOW For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange! END
BEGIN NOW Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small END
BEGIN NOW Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught END
BEGIN NOW Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons END
BEGIN NOW With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore. END
BEGIN NOW Meanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings END
BEGIN NOW Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove END
BEGIN NOW From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie END
BEGIN NOW Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist, END
BEGIN NOW Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie END
BEGIN NOW Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain END
BEGIN NOW Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth END
BEGIN NOW No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum END
BEGIN NOW Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow END
BEGIN NOW Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else END
BEGIN NOW Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp END
BEGIN NOW Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea, END
BEGIN NOW Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces END
BEGIN NOW Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd END
BEGIN NOW And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late, END
BEGIN NOW All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't. END
BEGIN NOW How didst thou grieve then, ADAM, to behold END
BEGIN NOW The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad, END
BEGIN NOW Depopulation; thee another Floud, END
BEGIN NOW Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd, END
BEGIN NOW And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard END
BEGIN NOW By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last, END
BEGIN NOW Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns END
BEGIN NOW His Childern, all in view destroyd at once; END
BEGIN NOW And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. END
BEGIN NOW O Visions ill foreseen! better had I END
BEGIN NOW Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne END
BEGIN NOW My part of evil onely, each dayes lot END
BEGIN NOW Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst END
BEGIN NOW The burd'n of many Ages, on me light END
BEGIN NOW At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth END
BEGIN NOW Abortive, to torment me ere thir being, END
BEGIN NOW With thought that they must be. Let no man seek END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall END
BEGIN NOW Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure, END
BEGIN NOW Which neither his foreknowing can prevent, END
BEGIN NOW And hee the future evil shall no less END
BEGIN NOW In apprehension then in substance feel END
BEGIN NOW Grievous to bear: but that care now is past, END
BEGIN NOW Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't END
BEGIN NOW Famin and anguish will at last consume END
BEGIN NOW Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope END
BEGIN NOW When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth, END
BEGIN NOW All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd END
BEGIN NOW With length of happy days the race of man; END
BEGIN NOW But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see END
BEGIN NOW Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste. END
BEGIN NOW How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide, END
BEGIN NOW And whether here the Race of man will end. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus MICHAEL. Those whom last thou sawst END
BEGIN NOW In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they END
BEGIN NOW First seen in acts of prowess eminent END
BEGIN NOW And great exploits, but of true vertu void; END
BEGIN NOW Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste END
BEGIN NOW Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby END
BEGIN NOW Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey, END
BEGIN NOW Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, END
BEGIN NOW Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride END
BEGIN NOW Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace. END
BEGIN NOW The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr END
BEGIN NOW Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose END
BEGIN NOW And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd END
BEGIN NOW In sharp contest of Battel found no aide END
BEGIN NOW Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale END
BEGIN NOW Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, END
BEGIN NOW Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords END
BEGIN NOW Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear END
BEGIN NOW More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd: END
BEGIN NOW So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd, END
BEGIN NOW Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot; END
BEGIN NOW One Man except, the onely Son of light END
BEGIN NOW In a dark Age, against example good, END
BEGIN NOW Against allurement, custom, and a World END
BEGIN NOW Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn, END
BEGIN NOW Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes END
BEGIN NOW Shall them admonish, and before them set END
BEGIN NOW The paths of righteousness, how much more safe, END
BEGIN NOW And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come END
BEGIN NOW On thir impenitence; and shall returne END
BEGIN NOW Of them derided, but of God observd END
BEGIN NOW The one just Man alive; by his command END
BEGIN NOW Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst, END
BEGIN NOW To save himself and houshold from amidst END
BEGIN NOW A World devote to universal rack. END
BEGIN NOW No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast END
BEGIN NOW Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd, END
BEGIN NOW And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts END
BEGIN NOW Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre END
BEGIN NOW Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep END
BEGIN NOW Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp END
BEGIN NOW Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise END
BEGIN NOW Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount END
BEGIN NOW Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd END
BEGIN NOW Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud, END
BEGIN NOW With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift END
BEGIN NOW Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf, END
BEGIN NOW And there take root an Iland salt and bare, END
BEGIN NOW The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang. END
BEGIN NOW To teach thee that God attributes to place END
BEGIN NOW No sanctitie, if none be thither brought END
BEGIN NOW By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell. END
BEGIN NOW And now what further shall ensue, behold. END
BEGIN NOW He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud, END
BEGIN NOW Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled, END
BEGIN NOW Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie END
BEGIN NOW Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd; END
BEGIN NOW And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass END
BEGIN NOW Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew, END
BEGIN NOW As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink END
BEGIN NOW From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole END
BEGIN NOW With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt END
BEGIN NOW His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut. END
BEGIN NOW The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground END
BEGIN NOW Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt. END
BEGIN NOW And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer; END
BEGIN NOW With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive END
BEGIN NOW Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde. END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies, END
BEGIN NOW And after him, the surer messenger, END
BEGIN NOW A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie END
BEGIN NOW Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light; END
BEGIN NOW The second time returning, in his Bill END

BEGIN NOW Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke END
BEGIN NOW The ancient Sire descends with all his Train; END
BEGIN NOW Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, END
BEGIN NOW Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds END
BEGIN NOW A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow END
BEGIN NOW Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay, END
BEGIN NOW Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new. END

BEGIN NOW By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect END
BEGIN NOW Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword, END
BEGIN NOW In signal of remove, waves fiercely round; END
BEGIN NOW We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; END
BEGIN NOW Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm'd END
BEGIN NOW Portending good, and all her spirits compos'd END
BEGIN NOW To meek submission: thou at season fit END
BEGIN NOW Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard, END
BEGIN NOW Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know, END

BEGIN NOW Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress END
BEGIN NOW VVearied I fell asleep: but now lead on; END
BEGIN NOW In mee is no delay; with thee to goe, END

BEGIN NOW Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flowed END

BEGIN NOW Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme. END
BEGIN NOW And chiefly thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer END
BEGIN NOW Before all temples th' upright heart and pure, END
BEGIN NOW Instruct me, for thou know'st; thou from the first END
BEGIN NOW Wast present, and, with mighty wings outspread, END
BEGIN NOW Dove-like sat'st brooding on the vast Abyss, END
BEGIN NOW And mad'st it pregnant: what in me is dark END
BEGIN NOW Illumine, what is low raise and support; END
BEGIN NOW That, to the height of this great argument, END
BEGIN NOW I may assert Eternal Providence, END
BEGIN NOW And justify the ways of God to men. END
BEGIN NOW Say first--for Heaven hides nothing from thy view, END
BEGIN NOW Nor the deep tract of Hell--say first what cause END
BEGIN NOW Moved our grand parents, in that happy state, END
BEGIN NOW Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off END
BEGIN NOW From their Creator, and transgress his will END
BEGIN NOW For one restraint, lords of the World besides. END
BEGIN NOW Who first seduced them to that foul revolt? END
BEGIN NOW Th' infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile, END
BEGIN NOW Stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived END
BEGIN NOW The mother of mankind, what time his pride END
BEGIN NOW Had cast him out from Heaven, with all his host END
BEGIN NOW Of rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring END
BEGIN NOW To set himself in glory above his peers, END
BEGIN NOW He trusted to have equalled the Most High, END
BEGIN NOW If he opposed, and with ambitious aim END
BEGIN NOW Against the throne and monarchy of God, END
BEGIN NOW Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud, END
BEGIN NOW With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power END
BEGIN NOW Hurled headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky, END
BEGIN NOW With hideous ruin and combustion, down END
BEGIN NOW To bottomless perdition, there to dwell END
BEGIN NOW In adamantine chains and penal fire, END
BEGIN NOW Who durst defy th' Omnipotent to arms. END
BEGIN NOW Nine times the space that measures day and night END
BEGIN NOW To mortal men, he, with his horrid crew, END
BEGIN NOW Lay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf, END
BEGIN NOW Confounded, though immortal. But his doom END
BEGIN NOW Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought END
BEGIN NOW Both of lost happiness and lasting pain END
BEGIN NOW Torments him: round he throws his baleful eyes, END
BEGIN NOW That witnessed huge affliction and dismay, END
BEGIN NOW Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate. END
BEGIN NOW At once, as far as Angels ken, he views END
BEGIN NOW The dismal situation waste and wild. END
BEGIN NOW A dungeon horrible, on all sides round, END
BEGIN NOW As one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames END
BEGIN NOW No light; but rather darkness visible END
BEGIN NOW Served only to discover sights of woe, END
BEGIN NOW Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace END
BEGIN NOW And rest can never dwell, hope never comes END
BEGIN NOW That comes to all, but torture without end END
BEGIN NOW Still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed END
BEGIN NOW With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed. END
BEGIN NOW Such place Eternal Justice has prepared END
BEGIN NOW For those rebellious; here their prison ordained END
BEGIN NOW In utter darkness, and their portion set, END
BEGIN NOW As far removed from God and light of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW As from the centre thrice to th' utmost pole. END
BEGIN NOW Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell! END
BEGIN NOW There the companions of his fall, o'erwhelmed END
BEGIN NOW With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, END
BEGIN NOW He soon discerns; and, weltering by his side, END
BEGIN NOW One next himself in power, and next in crime, END
BEGIN NOW Long after known in Palestine, and named END
BEGIN NOW Beelzebub. To whom th' Arch-Enemy, END
BEGIN NOW And thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words END
BEGIN NOW Breaking the horrid silence, thus began:-- END
BEGIN NOW If thou beest he--but O how fallen! how changed END
BEGIN NOW From him who, in the happy realms of light END
BEGIN NOW Clothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine END
BEGIN NOW Myriads, though bright!--if he whom mutual league, END
BEGIN NOW United thoughts and counsels, equal hope END
BEGIN NOW And hazard in the glorious enterprise END
BEGIN NOW Joined with me once, now misery hath joined END
BEGIN NOW In equal ruin; into what pit thou seest END
BEGIN NOW From what height fallen: so much the stronger proved END
BEGIN NOW He with his thunder; and till then who knew END
BEGIN NOW The force of those dire arms? Yet not for those, END
BEGIN NOW Nor what the potent Victor in his rage END
BEGIN NOW Can else inflict, do I repent, or change, END
BEGIN NOW Though changed in outward lustre, that fixed mind, END
BEGIN NOW And high disdain from sense of injured merit, END
BEGIN NOW That with the Mightiest raised me to contend, END
BEGIN NOW And to the fierce contentions brought along END
BEGIN NOW Innumerable force of Spirits armed, END
BEGIN NOW That durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring, END
BEGIN NOW His utmost power with adverse power opposed END
BEGIN NOW In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW And shook his throne. What though the field be lost? END
BEGIN NOW All is not lost--the unconquerable will, END
BEGIN NOW And study of revenge, immortal hate, END
BEGIN NOW And courage never to submit or yield: END
BEGIN NOW And what is else not to be overcome? END
BEGIN NOW That glory never shall his wrath or might END
BEGIN NOW Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace END
BEGIN NOW With suppliant knee, and deify his power END
BEGIN NOW Who, from the terror of this arm, so late END
BEGIN NOW Doubted his empire--that were low indeed; END
BEGIN NOW That were an ignominy and shame beneath END
BEGIN NOW This downfall; since, by fate, the strength of Gods, END
BEGIN NOW And this empyreal sybstance, cannot fail; END
BEGIN NOW Since, through experience of this great event, END
BEGIN NOW In arms not worse, in foresight much advanced, END
BEGIN NOW We may with more successful hope resolve END
BEGIN NOW To wage by force or guile eternal war, END
BEGIN NOW Irreconcilable to our grand Foe, END
BEGIN NOW Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy END
BEGIN NOW Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW So spake th' apostate Angel, though in pain, END
BEGIN NOW Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair; END
BEGIN NOW And him thus answered soon his bold compeer:-- END
BEGIN NOW O Prince, O Chief of many throned Powers END
BEGIN NOW That led th' embattled Seraphim to war END
BEGIN NOW Under thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds END
BEGIN NOW Fearless, endangered Heaven's perpetual King, END
BEGIN NOW And put to proof his high supremacy, END
BEGIN NOW Whether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate, END
BEGIN NOW Too well I see and rue the dire event END
BEGIN NOW That, with sad overthrow and foul defeat, END
BEGIN NOW Hath lost us Heaven, and all this mighty host END
BEGIN NOW In horrible destruction laid thus low, END
BEGIN NOW As far as Gods and heavenly Essences END
BEGIN NOW Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains END
BEGIN NOW Invincible, and vigour soon returns, END
BEGIN NOW Though all our glory extinct, and happy state END
BEGIN NOW Here swallowed up in endless misery. END
BEGIN NOW But what if he our Conqueror (whom I now END
BEGIN NOW Of force believe almighty, since no less END
BEGIN NOW Than such could have o'erpowered such force as ours) END
BEGIN NOW Have left us this our spirit and strength entire, END
BEGIN NOW Strongly to suffer and support our pains, END
BEGIN NOW That we may so suffice his vengeful ire, END
BEGIN NOW Or do him mightier service as his thralls END
BEGIN NOW By right of war, whate'er his business be, END
BEGIN NOW Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire, END
BEGIN NOW Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep? END
BEGIN NOW What can it the avail though yet we feel END
BEGIN NOW Strength undiminished, or eternal being END
BEGIN NOW To undergo eternal punishment? END
BEGIN NOW Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-Fiend replied:-- END
BEGIN NOW Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable, END
BEGIN NOW Doing or suffering: but of this be sure-- END
BEGIN NOW To do aught good never will be our task, END
BEGIN NOW But ever to do ill our sole delight, END
BEGIN NOW As being the contrary to his high will END
BEGIN NOW Whom we resist. If then his providence END
BEGIN NOW Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, END
BEGIN NOW Our labour must be to pervert that end, END
BEGIN NOW And out of good still to find means of evil; END
BEGIN NOW Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps END
BEGIN NOW Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb END
BEGIN NOW His inmost counsels from their destined aim. END
BEGIN NOW But see! the angry Victor hath recalled END
BEGIN NOW His ministers of vengeance and pursuit END
BEGIN NOW Back to the gates of Heaven: the sulphurous hail, END
BEGIN NOW Shot after us in storm, o'erblown hath laid END
BEGIN NOW The fiery surge that from the precipice END
BEGIN NOW Of Heaven received us falling; and the thunder, END
BEGIN NOW Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage, END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now END
BEGIN NOW To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep. END
BEGIN NOW Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn END
BEGIN NOW Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe. END
BEGIN NOW Seest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild, END
BEGIN NOW The seat of desolation, void of light, END
BEGIN NOW Save what the glimmering of these livid flames END
BEGIN NOW Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend END
BEGIN NOW From off the tossing of these fiery waves; END
BEGIN NOW There rest, if any rest can harbour there; END
BEGIN NOW And, re-assembling our afflicted powers, END
BEGIN NOW Consult how we may henceforth most offend END
BEGIN NOW Our enemy, our own loss how repair, END
BEGIN NOW How overcome this dire calamity, END
BEGIN NOW What reinforcement we may gain from hope, END
BEGIN NOW If not, what resolution from despair. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Satan, talking to his nearest mate, END
BEGIN NOW With head uplift above the wave, and eyes END
BEGIN NOW That sparkling blazed; his other parts besides END
BEGIN NOW Prone on the flood, extended long and large, END
BEGIN NOW Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge END
BEGIN NOW As whom the fables name of monstrous size, END
BEGIN NOW Titanian or Earth-born, that warred on Jove, END
BEGIN NOW Briareos or Typhon, whom the den END
BEGIN NOW By ancient Tarsus held, or that sea-beast END
BEGIN NOW Leviathan, which God of all his works END
BEGIN NOW Created hugest that swim th' ocean-stream. END
BEGIN NOW Him, haply slumbering on the Norway foam, END
BEGIN NOW The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff, END
BEGIN NOW Deeming some island, oft, as seamen tell, END
BEGIN NOW With fixed anchor in his scaly rind, END
BEGIN NOW Moors by his side under the lee, while night END
BEGIN NOW Invests the sea, and wished morn delays. END
BEGIN NOW So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay, END
BEGIN NOW Chained on the burning lake; nor ever thence END
BEGIN NOW Had risen, or heaved his head, but that the will END
BEGIN NOW And high permission of all-ruling Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Left him at large to his own dark designs, END
BEGIN NOW That with reiterated crimes he might END
BEGIN NOW Heap on himself damnation, while he sought END
BEGIN NOW Evil to others, and enraged might see END
BEGIN NOW How all his malice served but to bring forth END
BEGIN NOW Infinite goodness, grace, and mercy, shewn END
BEGIN NOW On Man by him seduced, but on himself END
BEGIN NOW Treble confusion, wrath, and vengeance poured. END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool END
BEGIN NOW His mighty stature; on each hand the flames END
BEGIN NOW Driven backward slope their pointing spires, and rolled END
BEGIN NOW In billows, leave i' th' midst a horrid vale. END
BEGIN NOW Then with expanded wings he steers his flight END
BEGIN NOW Aloft, incumbent on the dusky air, END
BEGIN NOW That felt unusual weight; till on dry land END
BEGIN NOW He lights--if it were land that ever burned END
BEGIN NOW With solid, as the lake with liquid fire, END
BEGIN NOW And such appeared in hue as when the force END
BEGIN NOW Of subterranean wind transports a hill END
BEGIN NOW Torn from Pelorus, or the shattered side END
BEGIN NOW Of thundering Etna, whose combustible END
BEGIN NOW And fuelled entrails, thence conceiving fire, END
BEGIN NOW Sublimed with mineral fury, aid the winds, END
BEGIN NOW And leave a singed bottom all involved END
BEGIN NOW With stench and smoke. Such resting found the sole END
BEGIN NOW Of unblest feet. Him followed his next mate; END
BEGIN NOW Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood END
BEGIN NOW As gods, and by their own recovered strength, END
BEGIN NOW Not by the sufferance of supernal Power. END
BEGIN NOW Is this the region, this the soil, the clime, END
BEGIN NOW Said then the lost Archangel, "this the seat END
BEGIN NOW That we must change for Heaven?--this mournful gloom END
BEGIN NOW For that celestial light? Be it so, since he END
BEGIN NOW Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid END
BEGIN NOW What shall be right: farthest from him is best END
BEGIN NOW Whom reason hath equalled, force hath made supreme END
BEGIN NOW Above his equals. Farewell, happy fields, END
BEGIN NOW Where joy for ever dwells! Hail, horrors! hail, END
BEGIN NOW Infernal world! and thou, profoundest Hell, END
BEGIN NOW Receive thy new possessor--one who brings END
BEGIN NOW A mind not to be changed by place or time. END
BEGIN NOW The mind is its own place, and in itself END
BEGIN NOW Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW What matter where, if I be still the same, END
BEGIN NOW And what I should be, all but less than he END
BEGIN NOW Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least END
BEGIN NOW We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built END
BEGIN NOW Here for his envy, will not drive us hence: END
BEGIN NOW Here we may reign secure; and, in my choice, END
BEGIN NOW To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell: END
BEGIN NOW Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW But wherefore let we then our faithful friends, END
BEGIN NOW Th' associates and co-partners of our loss, END
BEGIN NOW Lie thus astonished on th' oblivious pool, END
BEGIN NOW And call them not to share with us their part END
BEGIN NOW In this unhappy mansion, or once more END
BEGIN NOW With rallied arms to try what may be yet END
BEGIN NOW Regained in Heaven, or what more lost in Hell? END
BEGIN NOW So Satan spake; and him Beelzebub END
BEGIN NOW Thus answered:--"Leader of those armies bright END
BEGIN NOW Which, but th' Omnipotent, none could have foiled! END
BEGIN NOW If once they hear that voice, their liveliest pledge END
BEGIN NOW Of hope in fears and dangers--heard so oft END
BEGIN NOW In worst extremes, and on the perilous edge END
BEGIN NOW Of battle, when it raged, in all assaults END
BEGIN NOW Their surest signal--they will soon resume END
BEGIN NOW New courage and revive, though now they lie END
BEGIN NOW Grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire, END
BEGIN NOW As we erewhile, astounded and amazed; END
BEGIN NOW No wonder, fallen such a pernicious height! END
BEGIN NOW He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend END
BEGIN NOW Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield, END
BEGIN NOW Ethereal temper, massy, large, and round, END
BEGIN NOW Behind him cast. The broad circumference END
BEGIN NOW Hung on his shoulders like the moon, whose orb END
BEGIN NOW Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views END
BEGIN NOW At evening, from the top of Fesole, END
BEGIN NOW Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands, END
BEGIN NOW Rivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe. END
BEGIN NOW His spear--to equal which the tallest pine END
BEGIN NOW Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast END
BEGIN NOW Of some great ammiral, were but a wand-- END
BEGIN NOW He walked with, to support uneasy steps END
BEGIN NOW Over the burning marl, not like those steps END
BEGIN NOW On Heaven's azure; and the torrid clime END
BEGIN NOW Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire. END
BEGIN NOW Nathless he so endured, till on the beach END
BEGIN NOW Of that inflamed sea he stood, and called END
BEGIN NOW His legions--Angel Forms, who lay entranced END
BEGIN NOW Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks END
BEGIN NOW In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades END
BEGIN NOW High over-arched embower; or scattered sedge END
BEGIN NOW Afloat, when with fierce winds Orion armed END
BEGIN NOW Hath vexed the Red-Sea coast, whose waves o'erthrew END
BEGIN NOW Busiris and his Memphian chivalry, END
BEGIN NOW While with perfidious hatred they pursued END
BEGIN NOW The sojourners of Goshen, who beheld END
BEGIN NOW From the safe shore their floating carcases END
BEGIN NOW And broken chariot-wheels. So thick bestrown, END
BEGIN NOW Abject and lost, lay these, covering the flood, END
BEGIN NOW Under amazement of their hideous change. END
BEGIN NOW He called so loud that all the hollow deep END
BEGIN NOW Of Hell resounded:--"Princes, Potentates, END
BEGIN NOW Warriors, the Flower of Heaven--once yours; now lost, END
BEGIN NOW If such astonishment as this can seize END
BEGIN NOW Eternal Spirits! Or have ye chosen this place END
BEGIN NOW After the toil of battle to repose END
BEGIN NOW Your wearied virtue, for the ease you find END
BEGIN NOW To slumber here, as in the vales of Heaven? END
BEGIN NOW Or in this abject posture have ye sworn END
BEGIN NOW To adore the Conqueror, who now beholds END
BEGIN NOW Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood END
BEGIN NOW With scattered arms and ensigns, till anon END
BEGIN NOW His swift pursuers from Heaven-gates discern END
BEGIN NOW Th' advantage, and, descending, tread us down END
BEGIN NOW Thus drooping, or with linked thunderbolts END
BEGIN NOW Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf? END
BEGIN NOW Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen! END
BEGIN NOW They heard, and were abashed, and up they sprung END
BEGIN NOW Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch END
BEGIN NOW On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread, END
BEGIN NOW Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake. END
BEGIN NOW Nor did they not perceive the evil plight END
BEGIN NOW In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel; END
BEGIN NOW Yet to their General's voice they soon obeyed END
BEGIN NOW Innumerable. As when the potent rod END
BEGIN NOW Waved round the coast, up-called a pitchy cloud END
BEGIN NOW Of locusts, warping on the eastern wind, END
BEGIN NOW That o'er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung END
BEGIN NOW Like Night, and darkened all the land of Nile; END
BEGIN NOW So numberless were those bad Angels seen END
BEGIN NOW Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell, END
BEGIN NOW 'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding fires; END
BEGIN NOW Till, as a signal given, th' uplifted spear END
BEGIN NOW Of their great Sultan waving to direct END
BEGIN NOW Their course, in even balance down they light END
BEGIN NOW On the firm brimstone, and fill all the plain: END
BEGIN NOW A multitude like which the populous North END
BEGIN NOW Poured never from her frozen loins to pass END
BEGIN NOW Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous sons END
BEGIN NOW Came like a deluge on the South, and spread END
BEGIN NOW Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands. END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith, form every squadron and each band, END
BEGIN NOW The heads and leaders thither haste where stood END
BEGIN NOW Their great Commander--godlike Shapes, and Forms END
BEGIN NOW Excelling human; princely Dignities; END
BEGIN NOW And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on thrones, END
BEGIN NOW Though on their names in Heavenly records now END
BEGIN NOW Be no memorial, blotted out and rased END
BEGIN NOW By their rebellion from the Books of Life. END
BEGIN NOW Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve END
BEGIN NOW Got them new names, till, wandering o'er the earth, END
BEGIN NOW Through God's high sufferance for the trial of man, END
BEGIN NOW By falsities and lies the greatest part END
BEGIN NOW Of mankind they corrupted to forsake END
BEGIN NOW God their Creator, and th' invisible END
BEGIN NOW Glory of him that made them to transform END
BEGIN NOW Oft to the image of a brute, adorned END
BEGIN NOW With gay religions full of pomp and gold, END
BEGIN NOW And devils to adore for deities: END
BEGIN NOW Then were they known to men by various names, END
BEGIN NOW And various idols through the heathen world. END
BEGIN NOW Say, Muse, their names then known, who first, who last, END
BEGIN NOW Roused from the slumber on that fiery couch, END
BEGIN NOW At their great Emperor's call, as next in worth END
BEGIN NOW Came singly where he stood on the bare strand, END
BEGIN NOW While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof? END
BEGIN NOW The chief were those who, from the pit of Hell END
BEGIN NOW Roaming to seek their prey on Earth, durst fix END
BEGIN NOW Their seats, long after, next the seat of God, END
BEGIN NOW Their altars by his altar, gods adored END
BEGIN NOW Among the nations round, and durst abide END
BEGIN NOW Jehovah thundering out of Sion, throned END
BEGIN NOW Between the Cherubim; yea, often placed END
BEGIN NOW Within his sanctuary itself their shrines, END
BEGIN NOW Abominations; and with cursed things END
BEGIN NOW His holy rites and solemn feasts profaned, END
BEGIN NOW And with their darkness durst affront his light. END
BEGIN NOW First, Moloch, horrid king, besmeared with blood END
BEGIN NOW Of human sacrifice, and parents' tears; END
BEGIN NOW Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud, END
BEGIN NOW Their children's cries unheard that passed through fire END
BEGIN NOW To his grim idol. Him the Ammonite END
BEGIN NOW Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain, END
BEGIN NOW In Argob and in Basan, to the stream END
BEGIN NOW Of utmost Arnon. Nor content with such END
BEGIN NOW Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart END
BEGIN NOW Of Solomon he led by fraud to build END
BEGIN NOW His temple right against the temple of God END
BEGIN NOW On that opprobrious hill, and made his grove END
BEGIN NOW The pleasant valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence END
BEGIN NOW And black Gehenna called, the type of Hell. END
BEGIN NOW Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moab's sons, END
BEGIN NOW From Aroar to Nebo and the wild END
BEGIN NOW Of southmost Abarim; in Hesebon END
BEGIN NOW And Horonaim, Seon's real, beyond END
BEGIN NOW The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines, END
BEGIN NOW Peor his other name, when he enticed END
BEGIN NOW Israel in Sittim, on their march from Nile, END
BEGIN NOW To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. END
BEGIN NOW Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged END
BEGIN NOW Even to that hill of scandal, by the grove END
BEGIN NOW Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate, END
BEGIN NOW Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell. END
BEGIN NOW With these came they who, from the bordering flood END
BEGIN NOW Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts END
BEGIN NOW Of Baalim and Ashtaroth--those male, END
BEGIN NOW These feminine. For Spirits, when they please, END
BEGIN NOW Can either sex assume, or both; so soft END
BEGIN NOW And uncompounded is their essence pure, END
BEGIN NOW Not tried or manacled with joint or limb, END
BEGIN NOW Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones, END
BEGIN NOW Like cumbrous flesh; but, in what shape they choose, END
BEGIN NOW Dilated or condensed, bright or obscure, END
BEGIN NOW Can execute their airy purposes, END
BEGIN NOW And works of love or enmity fulfil. END
BEGIN NOW For those the race of Israel oft forsook END
BEGIN NOW Their Living Strength, and unfrequented left END
BEGIN NOW His righteous altar, bowing lowly down END
BEGIN NOW To bestial gods; for which their heads as low END
BEGIN NOW Bowed down in battle, sunk before the spear END
BEGIN NOW Of despicable foes. With these in troop END
BEGIN NOW Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians called END
BEGIN NOW Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent horns; END
BEGIN NOW To whose bright image nightly by the moon END
BEGIN NOW Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs; END
BEGIN NOW In Sion also not unsung, where stood END
BEGIN NOW Her temple on th' offensive mountain, built END
BEGIN NOW By that uxorious king whose heart, though large, END
BEGIN NOW Beguiled by fair idolatresses, fell END
BEGIN NOW To idols foul. Thammuz came next behind, END
BEGIN NOW Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured END
BEGIN NOW The Syrian damsels to lament his fate END
BEGIN NOW In amorous ditties all a summer's day, END
BEGIN NOW While smooth Adonis from his native rock END
BEGIN NOW Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood END
BEGIN NOW Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the love-tale END
BEGIN NOW Infected Sion's daughters with like heat, END
BEGIN NOW Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch END
BEGIN NOW Ezekiel saw, when, by the vision led, END
BEGIN NOW His eye surveyed the dark idolatries END
BEGIN NOW Of alienated Judah. Next came one END
BEGIN NOW Who mourned in earnest, when the captive ark END
BEGIN NOW Maimed his brute image, head and hands lopt off, END
BEGIN NOW In his own temple, on the grunsel-edge, END
BEGIN NOW Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers: END
BEGIN NOW And downward fish; yet had his temple high END
BEGIN NOW Reared in Azotus, dreaded through the coast END
BEGIN NOW And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds. END
BEGIN NOW Him followed Rimmon, whose delightful seat END
BEGIN NOW Was fair Damascus, on the fertile banks END
BEGIN NOW Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams. END
BEGIN NOW He also against the house of God was bold: END
BEGIN NOW A leper once he lost, and gained a king-- END
BEGIN NOW Ahaz, his sottish conqueror, whom he drew END
BEGIN NOW God's altar to disparage and displace END
BEGIN NOW For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn END
BEGIN NOW His odious offerings, and adore the gods END
BEGIN NOW Whom he had vanquished. After these appeared END
BEGIN NOW A crew who, under names of old renown-- END
BEGIN NOW Osiris, Isis, Orus, and their train-- END
BEGIN NOW With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused END
BEGIN NOW Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms END
BEGIN NOW Rather than human. Nor did Israel scape END
BEGIN NOW Th' infection, when their borrowed gold composed END
BEGIN NOW The calf in Oreb; and the rebel king END
BEGIN NOW Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan, END
BEGIN NOW Likening his Maker to the grazed ox-- END
BEGIN NOW Jehovah, who, in one night, when he passed END
BEGIN NOW Both her first-born and all her bleating gods. END
BEGIN NOW Belial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd END
BEGIN NOW Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love END
BEGIN NOW Vice for itself. To him no temple stood END
BEGIN NOW Or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he END
BEGIN NOW In temples and at altars, when the priest END
BEGIN NOW Turns atheist, as did Eli's sons, who filled END
BEGIN NOW With lust and violence the house of God? END
BEGIN NOW In courts and palaces he also reigns, END
BEGIN NOW And in luxurious cities, where the noise END
BEGIN NOW Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers, END
BEGIN NOW And injury and outrage; and, when night END
BEGIN NOW Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons END
BEGIN NOW Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine. END
BEGIN NOW Witness the streets of Sodom, and that night END
BEGIN NOW In Gibeah, when the hospitable door END
BEGIN NOW Exposed a matron, to avoid worse rape. END
BEGIN NOW These were the prime in order and in might: END
BEGIN NOW The rest were long to tell; though far renowned END
BEGIN NOW Th' Ionian gods--of Javan's issue held END
BEGIN NOW Gods, yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth, END
BEGIN NOW Their boasted parents;--Titan, Heaven's first-born, END
BEGIN NOW With his enormous brood, and birthright seized END
BEGIN NOW By younger Saturn: he from mightier Jove, END
BEGIN NOW His own and Rhea's son, like measure found; END
BEGIN NOW So Jove usurping reigned. These, first in Crete END
BEGIN NOW And Ida known, thence on the snowy top END
BEGIN NOW Of cold Olympus ruled the middle air, END
BEGIN NOW Their highest heaven; or on the Delphian cliff, END
BEGIN NOW Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds END
BEGIN NOW Of Doric land; or who with Saturn old END
BEGIN NOW Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian fields, END
BEGIN NOW And o'er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles. END
BEGIN NOW All these and more came flocking; but with looks END
BEGIN NOW Downcast and damp; yet such wherein appeared END
BEGIN NOW Obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their Chief END
BEGIN NOW Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost END
BEGIN NOW In loss itself; which on his countenance cast END
BEGIN NOW Like doubtful hue. But he, his wonted pride END
BEGIN NOW Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore END
BEGIN NOW Semblance of worth, not substance, gently raised END
BEGIN NOW Their fainting courage, and dispelled their fears. END
BEGIN NOW Then straight commands that, at the warlike sound END
BEGIN NOW Of trumpets loud and clarions, be upreared END
BEGIN NOW His mighty standard. That proud honour claimed END
BEGIN NOW Azazel as his right, a Cherub tall: END
BEGIN NOW Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled END
BEGIN NOW Th' imperial ensign; which, full high advanced, END
BEGIN NOW Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind, END
BEGIN NOW With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed, END
BEGIN NOW Seraphic arms and trophies; all the while END
BEGIN NOW Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds: END
BEGIN NOW At which the universal host up-sent END
BEGIN NOW A shout that tore Hell's concave, and beyond END
BEGIN NOW Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night. END
BEGIN NOW All in a moment through the gloom were seen END
BEGIN NOW Ten thousand banners rise into the air, END
BEGIN NOW With orient colours waving: with them rose END
BEGIN NOW A forest huge of spears; and thronging helms END
BEGIN NOW Appeared, and serried shields in thick array END
BEGIN NOW Of depth immeasurable. Anon they move END
BEGIN NOW In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood END
BEGIN NOW Of flutes and soft recorders--such as raised END
BEGIN NOW To height of noblest temper heroes old END
BEGIN NOW Arming to battle, and instead of rage END
BEGIN NOW Deliberate valour breathed, firm, and unmoved END
BEGIN NOW With dread of death to flight or foul retreat; END
BEGIN NOW Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage END
BEGIN NOW With solemn touches troubled thoughts, and chase END
BEGIN NOW Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain END
BEGIN NOW From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they, END
BEGIN NOW Breathing united force with fixed thought, END
BEGIN NOW Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed END
BEGIN NOW Their painful steps o'er the burnt soil. And now END
BEGIN NOW Advanced in view they stand--a horrid front END
BEGIN NOW Of dreadful length and dazzling arms, in guise END
BEGIN NOW Of warriors old, with ordered spear and shield, END
BEGIN NOW Awaiting what command their mighty Chief END
BEGIN NOW Had to impose. He through the armed files END
BEGIN NOW Darts his experienced eye, and soon traverse END
BEGIN NOW The whole battalion views--their order due, END
BEGIN NOW Their visages and stature as of gods; END
BEGIN NOW Their number last he sums. And now his heart END
BEGIN NOW Distends with pride, and, hardening in his strength, END
BEGIN NOW Glories: for never, since created Man, END
BEGIN NOW Met such embodied force as, named with these, END
BEGIN NOW Could merit more than that small infantry END
BEGIN NOW Warred on by cranes--though all the giant brood END
BEGIN NOW Of Phlegra with th' heroic race were joined END
BEGIN NOW That fought at Thebes and Ilium, on each side END
BEGIN NOW Mixed with auxiliar gods; and what resounds END
BEGIN NOW In fable or romance of Uther's son, END
BEGIN NOW Begirt with British and Armoric knights; END
BEGIN NOW And all who since, baptized or infidel, END
BEGIN NOW Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore END
BEGIN NOW When Charlemain with all his peerage fell END
BEGIN NOW By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond END
BEGIN NOW Compare of mortal prowess, yet observed END
BEGIN NOW Their dread Commander. He, above the rest END
BEGIN NOW In shape and gesture proudly eminent, END
BEGIN NOW Stood like a tower. His form had yet not lost END
BEGIN NOW All her original brightness, nor appeared END
BEGIN NOW Less than Archangel ruined, and th' excess END
BEGIN NOW Of glory obscured: as when the sun new-risen END
BEGIN NOW Looks through the horizontal misty air END
BEGIN NOW Shorn of his beams, or, from behind the moon, END
BEGIN NOW In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds END
BEGIN NOW On half the nations, and with fear of change END
BEGIN NOW Perplexes monarchs. Darkened so, yet shone END
BEGIN NOW Above them all th' Archangel: but his face END
BEGIN NOW Deep scars of thunder had intrenched, and care END
BEGIN NOW Sat on his faded cheek, but under brows END
BEGIN NOW Of dauntless courage, and considerate pride END
BEGIN NOW Waiting revenge. Cruel his eye, but cast END
BEGIN NOW Signs of remorse and passion, to behold END
BEGIN NOW The fellows of his crime, the followers rather END
BEGIN NOW (Far other once beheld in bliss), condemned END
BEGIN NOW For ever now to have their lot in pain-- END
BEGIN NOW Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced END
BEGIN NOW Of Heaven, and from eternal splendours flung END
BEGIN NOW For his revolt--yet faithful how they stood, END
BEGIN NOW Their glory withered; as, when heaven's fire END
BEGIN NOW Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines, END
BEGIN NOW With singed top their stately growth, though bare, END
BEGIN NOW Stands on the blasted heath. He now prepared END
BEGIN NOW To speak; whereat their doubled ranks they bend END
BEGIN NOW From wing to wing, and half enclose him round END
BEGIN NOW With all his peers: attention held them mute. END
BEGIN NOW Thrice he assayed, and thrice, in spite of scorn, END
BEGIN NOW Tears, such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last END
BEGIN NOW Words interwove with sighs found out their way:-- END
BEGIN NOW O myriads of immortal Spirits! O Powers END
BEGIN NOW Matchless, but with th' Almighty!--and that strife END
BEGIN NOW Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire, END
BEGIN NOW As this place testifies, and this dire change, END
BEGIN NOW Hateful to utter. But what power of mind, END
BEGIN NOW Forseeing or presaging, from the depth END
BEGIN NOW Of knowledge past or present, could have feared END
BEGIN NOW How such united force of gods, how such END
BEGIN NOW As stood like these, could ever know repulse? END
BEGIN NOW For who can yet believe, though after loss, END
BEGIN NOW That all these puissant legions, whose exile END
BEGIN NOW Hath emptied Heaven, shall fail to re-ascend, END
BEGIN NOW Self-raised, and repossess their native seat? END
BEGIN NOW For me, be witness all the host of Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW If counsels different, or danger shunned END
BEGIN NOW By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns END
BEGIN NOW Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure END
BEGIN NOW Sat on his throne, upheld by old repute, END
BEGIN NOW Consent or custom, and his regal state END
BEGIN NOW Put forth at full, but still his strength concealed-- END
BEGIN NOW Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall. END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth his might we know, and know our own, END
BEGIN NOW So as not either to provoke, or dread END
BEGIN NOW New war provoked: our better part remains END
BEGIN NOW To work in close design, by fraud or guile, END
BEGIN NOW What force effected not; that he no less END
BEGIN NOW At length from us may find, who overcomes END
BEGIN NOW By force hath overcome but half his foe. END
BEGIN NOW Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife END
BEGIN NOW There went a fame in Heaven that he ere long END
BEGIN NOW Intended to create, and therein plant END
BEGIN NOW A generation whom his choice regard END
BEGIN NOW Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps END
BEGIN NOW Our first eruption--thither, or elsewhere; END
BEGIN NOW For this infernal pit shall never hold END
BEGIN NOW Celestial Spirits in bondage, nor th' Abyss END
BEGIN NOW Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts END
BEGIN NOW Full counsel must mature. Peace is despaired; END
BEGIN NOW For who can think submission? War, then, war END
BEGIN NOW Open or understood, must be resolved. END
BEGIN NOW He spake; and, to confirm his words, outflew END
BEGIN NOW Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs END
BEGIN NOW Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze END
BEGIN NOW Far round illumined Hell. Highly they raged END
BEGIN NOW Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arms END
BEGIN NOW Clashed on their sounding shields the din of war, END
BEGIN NOW Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW There stood a hill not far, whose grisly top END
BEGIN NOW Belched fire and rolling smoke; the rest entire END
BEGIN NOW Shone with a glossy scurf--undoubted sign END
BEGIN NOW That in his womb was hid metallic ore, END
BEGIN NOW The work of sulphur. Thither, winged with speed, END
BEGIN NOW A numerous brigade hastened: as when bands END
BEGIN NOW Forerun the royal camp, to trench a field, END
BEGIN NOW Or cast a rampart. Mammon led them on-- END
BEGIN NOW Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell END
BEGIN NOW From Heaven; for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts END
BEGIN NOW Were always downward bent, admiring more END
BEGIN NOW The riches of heaven's pavement, trodden gold, END
BEGIN NOW Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed END
BEGIN NOW In vision beatific. By him first END
BEGIN NOW Men also, and by his suggestion taught, END
BEGIN NOW Ransacked the centre, and with impious hands END
BEGIN NOW Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth END
BEGIN NOW For treasures better hid. Soon had his crew END
BEGIN NOW Opened into the hill a spacious wound, END
BEGIN NOW And digged out ribs of gold. Let none admire END
BEGIN NOW That riches grow in Hell; that soil may best END
BEGIN NOW Deserve the precious bane. And here let those END
BEGIN NOW Who boast in mortal things, and wondering tell END
BEGIN NOW Of Babel, and the works of Memphian kings, END
BEGIN NOW Learn how their greatest monuments of fame END
BEGIN NOW And strength, and art, are easily outdone END
BEGIN NOW By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour END
BEGIN NOW What in an age they, with incessant toil END
BEGIN NOW And hands innumerable, scarce perform. END
BEGIN NOW Nigh on the plain, in many cells prepared, END
BEGIN NOW That underneath had veins of liquid fire END
BEGIN NOW Sluiced from the lake, a second multitude END
BEGIN NOW With wondrous art founded the massy ore, END
BEGIN NOW Severing each kind, and scummed the bullion-dross. END
BEGIN NOW A third as soon had formed within the ground END
BEGIN NOW A various mould, and from the boiling cells END
BEGIN NOW By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook; END
BEGIN NOW As in an organ, from one blast of wind, END
BEGIN NOW To many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes. END
BEGIN NOW Anon out of the earth a fabric huge END
BEGIN NOW Rose like an exhalation, with the sound END
BEGIN NOW Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet-- END
BEGIN NOW Built like a temple, where pilasters round END
BEGIN NOW Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid END
BEGIN NOW With golden architrave; nor did there want END
BEGIN NOW Cornice or frieze, with bossy sculptures graven; END
BEGIN NOW The roof was fretted gold. Not Babylon END
BEGIN NOW Nor great Alcairo such magnificence END
BEGIN NOW Equalled in all their glories, to enshrine END
BEGIN NOW Belus or Serapis their gods, or seat END
BEGIN NOW In wealth and luxury. Th' ascending pile END
BEGIN NOW Stood fixed her stately height, and straight the doors, END
BEGIN NOW Opening their brazen folds, discover, wide END
BEGIN NOW Within, her ample spaces o'er the smooth END
BEGIN NOW And level pavement: from the arched roof, END
BEGIN NOW Pendent by subtle magic, many a row END
BEGIN NOW Of starry lamps and blazing cressets, fed END
BEGIN NOW With naptha and asphaltus, yielded light END
BEGIN NOW As from a sky. The hasty multitude END
BEGIN NOW Admiring entered; and the work some praise, END
BEGIN NOW And some the architect. His hand was known END
BEGIN NOW In Heaven by many a towered structure high, END
BEGIN NOW Where sceptred Angels held their residence, END
BEGIN NOW And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King END
BEGIN NOW Exalted to such power, and gave to rule, END
BEGIN NOW Each in his Hierarchy, the Orders bright. END
BEGIN NOW Nor was his name unheard or unadored END
BEGIN NOW In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land END
BEGIN NOW Men called him Mulciber; and how he fell END
BEGIN NOW From Heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove END
BEGIN NOW Sheer o'er the crystal battlements: from morn END
BEGIN NOW To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve, END
BEGIN NOW A summer's day, and with the setting sun END
BEGIN NOW Dropt from the zenith, like a falling star, END
BEGIN NOW On Lemnos, th' Aegaean isle. Thus they relate, END
BEGIN NOW Erring; for he with this rebellious rout END
BEGIN NOW Fell long before; nor aught availed him now END
BEGIN NOW To have built in Heaven high towers; nor did he scape END
BEGIN NOW By all his engines, but was headlong sent, END
BEGIN NOW With his industrious crew, to build in Hell. END
BEGIN NOW Meanwhile the winged Heralds, by command END
BEGIN NOW Of sovereign power, with awful ceremony END
BEGIN NOW And trumpet's sound, throughout the host proclaim END
BEGIN NOW A solemn council forthwith to be held END
BEGIN NOW At Pandemonium, the high capital END
BEGIN NOW Of Satan and his peers. Their summons called END
BEGIN NOW From every band and squared regiment END
BEGIN NOW By place or choice the worthiest: they anon END
BEGIN NOW With hundreds and with thousands trooping came END
BEGIN NOW Attended. All access was thronged; the gates END
BEGIN NOW And porches wide, but chief the spacious hall END
BEGIN NOW (Though like a covered field, where champions bold END
BEGIN NOW Wont ride in armed, and at the Soldan's chair END
BEGIN NOW Defied the best of Paynim chivalry END
BEGIN NOW To mortal combat, or career with lance), END
BEGIN NOW Thick swarmed, both on the ground and in the air, END
BEGIN NOW Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings. As bees END
BEGIN NOW In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides. END
BEGIN NOW Pour forth their populous youth about the hive END
BEGIN NOW In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers END
BEGIN NOW Fly to and fro, or on the smoothed plank, END
BEGIN NOW The suburb of their straw-built citadel, END
BEGIN NOW New rubbed with balm, expatiate, and confer END
BEGIN NOW Their state-affairs: so thick the airy crowd END
BEGIN NOW Swarmed and were straitened; till, the signal given, END
BEGIN NOW Behold a wonder! They but now who seemed END
BEGIN NOW In bigness to surpass Earth's giant sons, END
BEGIN NOW Now less than smallest dwarfs, in narrow room END
BEGIN NOW Throng numberless--like that pygmean race END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the Indian mount; or faery elves, END
BEGIN NOW Whose midnight revels, by a forest-side END
BEGIN NOW Or fountain, some belated peasant sees, END
BEGIN NOW Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon END
BEGIN NOW Sits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth END
BEGIN NOW Wheels her pale course: they, on their mirth and dance END
BEGIN NOW Intent, with jocund music charm his ear; END
BEGIN NOW At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds. END
BEGIN NOW Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms END
BEGIN NOW Reduced their shapes immense, and were at large, END
BEGIN NOW Though without number still, amidst the hall END
BEGIN NOW Of that infernal court. But far within, END
BEGIN NOW And in their own dimensions like themselves, END
BEGIN NOW The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim END
BEGIN NOW In close recess and secret conclave sat, END
BEGIN NOW A thousand demi-gods on golden seats, END
BEGIN NOW Frequent and full. After short silence then, END
BEGIN NOW And summons read, the great consult began. END
BEGIN NOW High on a throne of royal state, which far END
BEGIN NOW Outshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind, END
BEGIN NOW Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand END
BEGIN NOW Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold, END
BEGIN NOW Satan exalted sat, by merit raised END
BEGIN NOW To that bad eminence; and, from despair END
BEGIN NOW Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires END
BEGIN NOW Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue END
BEGIN NOW Vain war with Heaven; and, by success untaught, END
BEGIN NOW His proud imaginations thus displayed:-- END
BEGIN NOW For, since no deep within her gulf can hold END
BEGIN NOW Immortal vigour, though oppressed and fallen, END
BEGIN NOW I give not Heaven for lost: from this descent END
BEGIN NOW Celestial Virtues rising will appear END
BEGIN NOW More glorious and more dread than from no fall, END
BEGIN NOW And trust themselves to fear no second fate!-- END
BEGIN NOW Me though just right, and the fixed laws of Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Did first create your leader--next, free choice END
BEGIN NOW With what besides in council or in fight END
BEGIN NOW Hath been achieved of merit--yet this loss, END
BEGIN NOW Thus far at least recovered, hath much more END
BEGIN NOW Established in a safe, unenvied throne, END
BEGIN NOW Yielded with full consent. The happier state END
BEGIN NOW In Heaven, which follows dignity, might draw END
BEGIN NOW Envy from each inferior; but who here END
BEGIN NOW Will envy whom the highest place exposes END
BEGIN NOW Foremost to stand against the Thunderer's aim END
BEGIN NOW Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share END
BEGIN NOW Of endless pain? Where there is, then, no good END
BEGIN NOW For which to strive, no strife can grow up there END
BEGIN NOW From faction: for none sure will claim in Hell END
BEGIN NOW Precedence; none whose portion is so small END
BEGIN NOW Of present pain that with ambitious mind END
BEGIN NOW Will covet more! With this advantage, then, END
BEGIN NOW To union, and firm faith, and firm accord, END
BEGIN NOW More than can be in Heaven, we now return END
BEGIN NOW To claim our just inheritance of old, END
BEGIN NOW Surer to prosper than prosperity END
BEGIN NOW Could have assured us; and by what best way, END
BEGIN NOW Whether of open war or covert guile, END
BEGIN NOW We now debate. Who can advise may speak. END
BEGIN NOW He ceased; and next him Moloch, sceptred king, END
BEGIN NOW Stood up--the strongest and the fiercest Spirit END
BEGIN NOW That fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair. END
BEGIN NOW His trust was with th' Eternal to be deemed END
BEGIN NOW Equal in strength, and rather than be less END
BEGIN NOW Cared not to be at all; with that care lost END
BEGIN NOW Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse, END
BEGIN NOW He recked not, and these words thereafter spake:-- END
BEGIN NOW My sentence is for open war. Of wiles, END
BEGIN NOW More unexpert, I boast not: them let those END
BEGIN NOW Contrive who need, or when they need; not now. END
BEGIN NOW For, while they sit contriving, shall the rest-- END
BEGIN NOW Millions that stand in arms, and longing wait END
BEGIN NOW The signal to ascend--sit lingering here, END
BEGIN NOW Heaven's fugitives, and for their dwelling-place END
BEGIN NOW Accept this dark opprobrious den of shame, END
BEGIN NOW The prison of his tyranny who reigns END
BEGIN NOW By our delay? No! let us rather choose, END
BEGIN NOW Armed with Hell-flames and fury, all at once END
BEGIN NOW O'er Heaven's high towers to force resistless way, END
BEGIN NOW Turning our tortures into horrid arms END
BEGIN NOW Against the Torturer; when, to meet the noise END
BEGIN NOW Of his almighty engine, he shall hear END
BEGIN NOW Infernal thunder, and, for lightning, see END
BEGIN NOW Black fire and horror shot with equal rage END
BEGIN NOW Among his Angels, and his throne itself END
BEGIN NOW Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire, END
BEGIN NOW His own invented torments. But perhaps END
BEGIN NOW The way seems difficult, and steep to scale END
BEGIN NOW With upright wing against a higher foe! END
BEGIN NOW Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench END
BEGIN NOW Of that forgetful lake benumb not still, END
BEGIN NOW That in our proper motion we ascend END
BEGIN NOW Up to our native seat; descent and fall END
BEGIN NOW To us is adverse. Who but felt of late, END
BEGIN NOW When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear END
BEGIN NOW Insulting, and pursued us through the Deep, END
BEGIN NOW With what compulsion and laborious flight END
BEGIN NOW We sunk thus low? Th' ascent is easy, then; END
BEGIN NOW Th' event is feared! Should we again provoke END
BEGIN NOW Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find END
BEGIN NOW To our destruction, if there be in Hell END
BEGIN NOW Fear to be worse destroyed! What can be worse END
BEGIN NOW Than to dwell here, driven out from bliss, condemned END
BEGIN NOW In this abhorred deep to utter woe! END
BEGIN NOW Where pain of unextinguishable fire END
BEGIN NOW Must exercise us without hope of end END
BEGIN NOW The vassals of his anger, when the scourge END
BEGIN NOW Inexorably, and the torturing hour, END
BEGIN NOW Calls us to penance? More destroyed than thus, END
BEGIN NOW We should be quite abolished, and expire. END
BEGIN NOW What fear we then? what doubt we to incense END
BEGIN NOW His utmost ire? which, to the height enraged, END
BEGIN NOW Will either quite consume us, and reduce END
BEGIN NOW To nothing this essential--happier far END
BEGIN NOW Than miserable to have eternal being!-- END
BEGIN NOW Or, if our substance be indeed divine, END
BEGIN NOW And cannot cease to be, we are at worst END
BEGIN NOW On this side nothing; and by proof we feel END
BEGIN NOW Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW And with perpetual inroads to alarm, END
BEGIN NOW Though inaccessible, his fatal throne: END
BEGIN NOW Which, if not victory, is yet revenge. END
BEGIN NOW He ended frowning, and his look denounced END
BEGIN NOW Desperate revenge, and battle dangerous END
BEGIN NOW To less than gods. On th' other side up rose END
BEGIN NOW Belial, in act more graceful and humane. END
BEGIN NOW A fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed END
BEGIN NOW For dignity composed, and high exploit. END
BEGIN NOW But all was false and hollow; though his tongue END
BEGIN NOW Dropped manna, and could make the worse appear END
BEGIN NOW The better reason, to perplex and dash END
BEGIN NOW Maturest counsels: for his thoughts were low-- END
BEGIN NOW To vice industrious, but to nobler deeds END
BEGIN NOW Timorous and slothful. Yet he pleased the ear, END
BEGIN NOW And with persuasive accent thus began:-- END
BEGIN NOW I should be much for open war, O Peers, END
BEGIN NOW As not behind in hate, if what was urged END
BEGIN NOW Main reason to persuade immediate war END
BEGIN NOW Did not dissuade me most, and seem to cast END
BEGIN NOW Ominous conjecture on the whole success; END
BEGIN NOW When he who most excels in fact of arms, END
BEGIN NOW In what he counsels and in what excels END
BEGIN NOW Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair END
BEGIN NOW And utter dissolution, as the scope END
BEGIN NOW Of all his aim, after some dire revenge. END
BEGIN NOW First, what revenge? The towers of Heaven are filled END
BEGIN NOW With armed watch, that render all access END
BEGIN NOW Impregnable: oft on the bordering Deep END
BEGIN NOW Encamp their legions, or with obscure wing END
BEGIN NOW Scout far and wide into the realm of Night, END
BEGIN NOW Scorning surprise. Or, could we break our way END
BEGIN NOW By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise END
BEGIN NOW With blackest insurrection to confound END
BEGIN NOW Heaven's purest light, yet our great Enemy, END
BEGIN NOW All incorruptible, would on his throne END
BEGIN NOW Sit unpolluted, and th' ethereal mould, END
BEGIN NOW Incapable of stain, would soon expel END
BEGIN NOW Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire, END
BEGIN NOW Victorious. Thus repulsed, our final hope END
BEGIN NOW Is flat despair: we must exasperate END
BEGIN NOW Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage; END
BEGIN NOW And that must end us; that must be our cure-- END
BEGIN NOW To be no more. Sad cure! for who would lose, END
BEGIN NOW Though full of pain, this intellectual being, END
BEGIN NOW Those thoughts that wander through eternity, END
BEGIN NOW To perish rather, swallowed up and lost END
BEGIN NOW In the wide womb of uncreated Night, END
BEGIN NOW Devoid of sense and motion? And who knows, END
BEGIN NOW Let this be good, whether our angry Foe END
BEGIN NOW Can give it, or will ever? How he can END
BEGIN NOW Is doubtful; that he never will is sure. END
BEGIN NOW Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, END
BEGIN NOW Belike through impotence or unaware, END
BEGIN NOW To give his enemies their wish, and end END
BEGIN NOW Them in his anger whom his anger saves END
BEGIN NOW To punish endless? "Wherefore cease we, then? END
BEGIN NOW Say they who counsel war; "we are decreed, END
BEGIN NOW Reserved, and destined to eternal woe; END
BEGIN NOW Whatever doing, what can we suffer more, END
BEGIN NOW What can we suffer worse?" Is this, then, worst-- END
BEGIN NOW Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms? END
BEGIN NOW What when we fled amain, pursued and struck END
BEGIN NOW With Heaven's afflicting thunder, and besought END
BEGIN NOW The Deep to shelter us? This Hell then seemed END
BEGIN NOW A refuge from those wounds. Or when we lay END
BEGIN NOW Chained on the burning lake? That sure was worse. END
BEGIN NOW What if the breath that kindled those grim fires, END
BEGIN NOW Awaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage, END
BEGIN NOW And plunge us in the flames; or from above END
BEGIN NOW Should intermitted vengeance arm again END
BEGIN NOW His red right hand to plague us? What if all END
BEGIN NOW Her stores were opened, and this firmament END
BEGIN NOW Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire, END
BEGIN NOW Impendent horrors, threatening hideous fall END
BEGIN NOW One day upon our heads; while we perhaps, END
BEGIN NOW Designing or exhorting glorious war, END
BEGIN NOW Caught in a fiery tempest, shall be hurled, END
BEGIN NOW Each on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey END
BEGIN NOW Or racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk END
BEGIN NOW Under yon boiling ocean, wrapt in chains, END
BEGIN NOW There to converse with everlasting groans, END
BEGIN NOW Unrespited, unpitied, unreprieved, END
BEGIN NOW Ages of hopeless end? This would be worse. END
BEGIN NOW War, therefore, open or concealed, alike END
BEGIN NOW My voice dissuades; for what can force or guile END
BEGIN NOW With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye END
BEGIN NOW Views all things at one view? He from Heaven's height END
BEGIN NOW All these our motions vain sees and derides, END
BEGIN NOW Not more almighty to resist our might END
BEGIN NOW Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. END
BEGIN NOW Shall we, then, live thus vile--the race of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Thus trampled, thus expelled, to suffer here END
BEGIN NOW Chains and these torments? Better these than worse, END
BEGIN NOW By my advice; since fate inevitable END
BEGIN NOW Subdues us, and omnipotent decree, END
BEGIN NOW The Victor's will. To suffer, as to do, END
BEGIN NOW Our strength is equal; nor the law unjust END
BEGIN NOW That so ordains. This was at first resolved, END
BEGIN NOW If we were wise, against so great a foe END
BEGIN NOW Contending, and so doubtful what might fall. END
BEGIN NOW I laugh when those who at the spear are bold END
BEGIN NOW And venturous, if that fail them, shrink, and fear END
BEGIN NOW What yet they know must follow--to endure END
BEGIN NOW Exile, or igominy, or bonds, or pain, END
BEGIN NOW The sentence of their Conqueror. This is now END
BEGIN NOW Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, END
BEGIN NOW Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit END
BEGIN NOW His anger, and perhaps, thus far removed, END
BEGIN NOW Not mind us not offending, satisfied END
BEGIN NOW With what is punished; whence these raging fires END
BEGIN NOW Will slacken, if his breath stir not their flames. END
BEGIN NOW Our purer essence then will overcome END
BEGIN NOW Their noxious vapour; or, inured, not feel; END
BEGIN NOW Or, changed at length, and to the place conformed END
BEGIN NOW In temper and in nature, will receive END
BEGIN NOW Familiar the fierce heat; and, void of pain, END
BEGIN NOW This horror will grow mild, this darkness light; END
BEGIN NOW Besides what hope the never-ending flight END
BEGIN NOW Of future days may bring, what chance, what change END
BEGIN NOW Worth waiting--since our present lot appears END
BEGIN NOW For happy though but ill, for ill not worst, END
BEGIN NOW If we procure not to ourselves more woe. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Belial, with words clothed in reason's garb, END
BEGIN NOW Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth, END
BEGIN NOW Not peace; and after him thus Mammon spake:-- END
BEGIN NOW Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW We war, if war be best, or to regain END
BEGIN NOW Our own right lost. Him to unthrone we then END
BEGIN NOW May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yield END
BEGIN NOW To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife. END
BEGIN NOW The former, vain to hope, argues as vain END
BEGIN NOW The latter; for what place can be for us END
BEGIN NOW Within Heaven's bound, unless Heaven's Lord supreme END
BEGIN NOW We overpower? Suppose he should relent END
BEGIN NOW And publish grace to all, on promise made END
BEGIN NOW Of new subjection; with what eyes could we END
BEGIN NOW Stand in his presence humble, and receive END
BEGIN NOW Strict laws imposed, to celebrate his throne END
BEGIN NOW With warbled hymns, and to his Godhead sing END
BEGIN NOW Forced hallelujahs, while he lordly sits END
BEGIN NOW Our envied sovereign, and his altar breathes END
BEGIN NOW Ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers, END
BEGIN NOW Our servile offerings? This must be our task END
BEGIN NOW In Heaven, this our delight. How wearisome END
BEGIN NOW Eternity so spent in worship paid END
BEGIN NOW To whom we hate! Let us not then pursue, END
BEGIN NOW By force impossible, by leave obtained END
BEGIN NOW Unacceptable, though in Heaven, our state END
BEGIN NOW Of splendid vassalage; but rather seek END
BEGIN NOW Our own good from ourselves, and from our own END
BEGIN NOW Live to ourselves, though in this vast recess, END
BEGIN NOW Free and to none accountable, preferring END
BEGIN NOW Hard liberty before the easy yoke END
BEGIN NOW Of servile pomp. Our greatness will appear END
BEGIN NOW Then most conspicuous when great things of small, END
BEGIN NOW Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse, END
BEGIN NOW We can create, and in what place soe'er END
BEGIN NOW Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain END
BEGIN NOW Through labour and endurance. This deep world END
BEGIN NOW Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst END
BEGIN NOW Thick clouds and dark doth Heaven's all-ruling Sire END
BEGIN NOW Choose to reside, his glory unobscured, END
BEGIN NOW And with the majesty of darkness round END
BEGIN NOW Covers his throne, from whence deep thunders roar. END
BEGIN NOW Mustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Hell! END
BEGIN NOW As he our darkness, cannot we his light END
BEGIN NOW Imitate when we please? This desert soil END
BEGIN NOW Wants not her hidden lustre, gems and gold; END
BEGIN NOW Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise END
BEGIN NOW Magnificence; and what can Heaven show more? END
BEGIN NOW Our torments also may, in length of time, END
BEGIN NOW Become our elements, these piercing fires END
BEGIN NOW As soft as now severe, our temper changed END
BEGIN NOW Into their temper; which must needs remove END
BEGIN NOW The sensible of pain. All things invite END
BEGIN NOW To peaceful counsels, and the settled state END
BEGIN NOW Of order, how in safety best we may END
BEGIN NOW Compose our present evils, with regard END
BEGIN NOW Of what we are and where, dismissing quite END
BEGIN NOW All thoughts of war. Ye have what I advise. END
BEGIN NOW He scarce had finished, when such murmur filled END
BEGIN NOW Th' assembly as when hollow rocks retain END
BEGIN NOW The sound of blustering winds, which all night long END
BEGIN NOW Had roused the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull END
BEGIN NOW Seafaring men o'erwatched, whose bark by chance END
BEGIN NOW Or pinnace, anchors in a craggy bay END
BEGIN NOW After the tempest. Such applause was heard END
BEGIN NOW As Mammon ended, and his sentence pleased, END
BEGIN NOW Advising peace: for such another field END
BEGIN NOW They dreaded worse than Hell; so much the fear END
BEGIN NOW Of thunder and the sword of Michael END
BEGIN NOW Wrought still within them; and no less desire END
BEGIN NOW To found this nether empire, which might rise, END
BEGIN NOW By policy and long process of time, END
BEGIN NOW In emulation opposite to Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Which when Beelzebub perceived--than whom, END
BEGIN NOW Satan except, none higher sat--with grave END
BEGIN NOW Aspect he rose, and in his rising seemed END
BEGIN NOW A pillar of state. Deep on his front engraven END
BEGIN NOW Deliberation sat, and public care; END
BEGIN NOW And princely counsel in his face yet shone, END
BEGIN NOW Majestic, though in ruin. Sage he stood END
BEGIN NOW With Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear END
BEGIN NOW The weight of mightiest monarchies; his look END
BEGIN NOW Drew audience and attention still as night END
BEGIN NOW Or summer's noontide air, while thus he spake:-- END
BEGIN NOW Ethereal Virtues! or these titles now END
BEGIN NOW Must we renounce, and, changing style, be called END
BEGIN NOW Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote END
BEGIN NOW Inclines--here to continue, and build up here END
BEGIN NOW A growing empire; doubtless! while we dream, END
BEGIN NOW And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed END
BEGIN NOW This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat END
BEGIN NOW Beyond his potent arm, to live exempt END
BEGIN NOW From Heaven's high jurisdiction, in new league END
BEGIN NOW Banded against his throne, but to remain END
BEGIN NOW In strictest bondage, though thus far removed, END
BEGIN NOW Under th' inevitable curb, reserved END
BEGIN NOW His captive multitude. For he, to be sure, END
BEGIN NOW In height or depth, still first and last will reign END
BEGIN NOW Sole king, and of his kingdom lose no part END
BEGIN NOW By our revolt, but over Hell extend END
BEGIN NOW His empire, and with iron sceptre rule END
BEGIN NOW Us here, as with his golden those in Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW What sit we then projecting peace and war? END
BEGIN NOW War hath determined us and foiled with loss END
BEGIN NOW Irreparable; terms of peace yet none END
BEGIN NOW Vouchsafed or sought; for what peace will be given END
BEGIN NOW To us enslaved, but custody severe, END
BEGIN NOW And stripes and arbitrary punishment END
BEGIN NOW Inflicted? and what peace can we return, END
BEGIN NOW But, to our power, hostility and hate, END
BEGIN NOW Untamed reluctance, and revenge, though slow, END
BEGIN NOW Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least END
BEGIN NOW May reap his conquest, and may least rejoice END
BEGIN NOW In doing what we most in suffering feel? END
BEGIN NOW Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need END
BEGIN NOW With dangerous expedition to invade END
BEGIN NOW Heaven, whose high walls fear no assault or siege, END
BEGIN NOW Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find END
BEGIN NOW Some easier enterprise? There is a place END
BEGIN NOW (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Err not)--another World, the happy seat END
BEGIN NOW Of some new race, called Man, about this time END
BEGIN NOW To be created like to us, though less END
BEGIN NOW In power and excellence, but favoured more END
BEGIN NOW Of him who rules above; so was his will END
BEGIN NOW Pronounced among the Gods, and by an oath END
BEGIN NOW That shook Heaven's whole circumference confirmed. END
BEGIN NOW Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn END
BEGIN NOW What creatures there inhabit, of what mould END
BEGIN NOW Or substance, how endued, and what their power END
BEGIN NOW And where their weakness: how attempted best, END
BEGIN NOW By force of subtlety. Though Heaven be shut, END
BEGIN NOW And Heaven's high Arbitrator sit secure END
BEGIN NOW In his own strength, this place may lie exposed, END
BEGIN NOW The utmost border of his kingdom, left END
BEGIN NOW To their defence who hold it: here, perhaps, END
BEGIN NOW Some advantageous act may be achieved END
BEGIN NOW By sudden onset--either with Hell-fire END
BEGIN NOW To waste his whole creation, or possess END
BEGIN NOW All as our own, and drive, as we were driven, END
BEGIN NOW The puny habitants; or, if not drive, END
BEGIN NOW Seduce them to our party, that their God END
BEGIN NOW May prove their foe, and with repenting hand END
BEGIN NOW Abolish his own works. This would surpass END
BEGIN NOW Common revenge, and interrupt his joy END
BEGIN NOW In our confusion, and our joy upraise END
BEGIN NOW In his disturbance; when his darling sons, END
BEGIN NOW Hurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse END
BEGIN NOW Their frail original, and faded bliss-- END
BEGIN NOW Faded so soon! Advise if this be worth END
BEGIN NOW Attempting, or to sit in darkness here END
BEGIN NOW Hatching vain empires." Thus Beelzebub END
BEGIN NOW Pleaded his devilish counsel--first devised END
BEGIN NOW By Satan, and in part proposed: for whence, END
BEGIN NOW But from the author of all ill, could spring END
BEGIN NOW So deep a malice, to confound the race END
BEGIN NOW Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell END
BEGIN NOW To mingle and involve, done all to spite END
BEGIN NOW The great Creator? But their spite still serves END
BEGIN NOW His glory to augment. The bold design END
BEGIN NOW Pleased highly those infernal States, and joy END
BEGIN NOW Sparkled in all their eyes: with full assent END
BEGIN NOW They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews:-- END
BEGIN NOW Well have ye judged, well ended long debate, END
BEGIN NOW Synod of Gods, and, like to what ye are, END
BEGIN NOW Great things resolved, which from the lowest deep END
BEGIN NOW Will once more lift us up, in spite of fate, END
BEGIN NOW Nearer our ancient seat--perhaps in view END
BEGIN NOW Of those bright confines, whence, with neighbouring arms, END
BEGIN NOW And opportune excursion, we may chance END
BEGIN NOW Re-enter Heaven; or else in some mild zone END
BEGIN NOW Dwell, not unvisited of Heaven's fair light, END
BEGIN NOW Secure, and at the brightening orient beam END
BEGIN NOW Purge off this gloom: the soft delicious air, END
BEGIN NOW To heal the scar of these corrosive fires, END
BEGIN NOW Shall breathe her balm. But, first, whom shall we send END
BEGIN NOW In search of this new World? whom shall we find END
BEGIN NOW Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet END
BEGIN NOW The dark, unbottomed, infinite Abyss, END
BEGIN NOW And through the palpable obscure find out END
BEGIN NOW His uncouth way, or spread his airy flight, END
BEGIN NOW Upborne with indefatigable wings END
BEGIN NOW Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive END
BEGIN NOW The happy Isle? What strength, what art, can then END
BEGIN NOW Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe, END
BEGIN NOW Through the strict senteries and stations thick END
BEGIN NOW Of Angels watching round? Here he had need END
BEGIN NOW All circumspection: and we now no less END
BEGIN NOW Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send END
BEGIN NOW The weight of all, and our last hope, relies. END
BEGIN NOW This said, he sat; and expectation held END
BEGIN NOW His look suspense, awaiting who appeared END
BEGIN NOW To second, or oppose, or undertake END
BEGIN NOW The perilous attempt. But all sat mute, END
BEGIN NOW Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each END
BEGIN NOW In other's countenance read his own dismay, END
BEGIN NOW Astonished. None among the choice and prime END
BEGIN NOW Of those Heaven-warring champions could be found END
BEGIN NOW So hardy as to proffer or accept, END
BEGIN NOW Alone, the dreadful voyage; till, at last, END
BEGIN NOW Satan, whom now transcendent glory raised END
BEGIN NOW Above his fellows, with monarchal pride END
BEGIN NOW Conscious of highest worth, unmoved thus spake:-- END
BEGIN NOW With reason hath deep silence and demur END
BEGIN NOW Seized us, though undismayed. Long is the way END
BEGIN NOW And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light. END
BEGIN NOW Our prison strong, this huge convex of fire, END
BEGIN NOW Outrageous to devour, immures us round END
BEGIN NOW Ninefold; and gates of burning adamant, END
BEGIN NOW Barred over us, prohibit all egress. END
BEGIN NOW These passed, if any pass, the void profound END
BEGIN NOW Of unessential Night receives him next, END
BEGIN NOW Wide-gaping, and with utter loss of being END
BEGIN NOW Threatens him, plunged in that abortive gulf. END
BEGIN NOW If thence he scape, into whatever world, END
BEGIN NOW Or unknown region, what remains him less END
BEGIN NOW Than unknown dangers, and as hard escape? END
BEGIN NOW But I should ill become this throne, O Peers, END
BEGIN NOW And this imperial sovereignty, adorned END
BEGIN NOW With splendour, armed with power, if aught proposed END
BEGIN NOW And judged of public moment in the shape END
BEGIN NOW Of difficulty or danger, could deter END
BEGIN NOW Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume END
BEGIN NOW These royalties, and not refuse to reign, END
BEGIN NOW Refusing to accept as great a share END
BEGIN NOW Of hazard as of honour, due alike END
BEGIN NOW To him who reigns, and so much to him due END
BEGIN NOW Of hazard more as he above the rest END
BEGIN NOW High honoured sits? Go, therefore, mighty Powers, END
BEGIN NOW Terror of Heaven, though fallen; intend at home, END
BEGIN NOW While here shall be our home, what best may ease END
BEGIN NOW The present misery, and render Hell END
BEGIN NOW More tolerable; if there be cure or charm END
BEGIN NOW To respite, or deceive, or slack the pain END
BEGIN NOW Of this ill mansion: intermit no watch END
BEGIN NOW Against a wakeful foe, while I abroad END
BEGIN NOW Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek END
BEGIN NOW Deliverance for us all. This enterprise END
BEGIN NOW None shall partake with me." Thus saying, rose END
BEGIN NOW The Monarch, and prevented all reply; END
BEGIN NOW Prudent lest, from his resolution raised, END
BEGIN NOW Others among the chief might offer now, END
BEGIN NOW Certain to be refused, what erst they feared, END
BEGIN NOW And, so refused, might in opinion stand END
BEGIN NOW His rivals, winning cheap the high repute END
BEGIN NOW Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they END
BEGIN NOW Dreaded not more th' adventure than his voice END
BEGIN NOW Forbidding; and at once with him they rose. END
BEGIN NOW Their rising all at once was as the sound END
BEGIN NOW Of thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend END
BEGIN NOW With awful reverence prone, and as a God END
BEGIN NOW Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Nor failed they to express how much they praised END
BEGIN NOW That for the general safety he despised END
BEGIN NOW His own: for neither do the Spirits damned END
BEGIN NOW Lose all their virtue; lest bad men should boast END
BEGIN NOW Their specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, END
BEGIN NOW Or close ambition varnished o'er with zeal. END
BEGIN NOW Thus they their doubtful consultations dark END
BEGIN NOW Ended, rejoicing in their matchless Chief: END
BEGIN NOW As, when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds END
BEGIN NOW Ascending, while the north wind sleeps, o'erspread END
BEGIN NOW Heaven's cheerful face, the louring element END
BEGIN NOW Scowls o'er the darkened landscape snow or shower, END
BEGIN NOW If chance the radiant sun, with farewell sweet, END
BEGIN NOW Extend his evening beam, the fields revive, END
BEGIN NOW The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds END
BEGIN NOW Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings. END
BEGIN NOW O shame to men! Devil with devil damned END
BEGIN NOW Firm concord holds; men only disagree END
BEGIN NOW Of creatures rational, though under hope END
BEGIN NOW Of heavenly grace, and, God proclaiming peace, END
BEGIN NOW Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife END
BEGIN NOW Among themselves, and levy cruel wars END
BEGIN NOW Wasting the earth, each other to destroy: END
BEGIN NOW As if (which might induce us to accord) END
BEGIN NOW Man had not hellish foes enow besides, END
BEGIN NOW That day and night for his destruction wait! END
BEGIN NOW The Stygian council thus dissolved; and forth END
BEGIN NOW In order came the grand infernal Peers: END
BEGIN NOW Midst came their mighty Paramount, and seemed END
BEGIN NOW Alone th' antagonist of Heaven, nor less END
BEGIN NOW Than Hell's dread Emperor, with pomp supreme, END
BEGIN NOW And god-like imitated state: him round END
BEGIN NOW A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed END
BEGIN NOW With bright emblazonry, and horrent arms. END
BEGIN NOW Then of their session ended they bid cry END
BEGIN NOW With trumpet's regal sound the great result: END
BEGIN NOW Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim END
BEGIN NOW Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy, END
BEGIN NOW By herald's voice explained; the hollow Abyss END
BEGIN NOW Heard far and wide, and all the host of Hell END
BEGIN NOW With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim. END
BEGIN NOW Thence more at ease their minds, and somewhat raised END
BEGIN NOW By false presumptuous hope, the ranged Powers END
BEGIN NOW Disband; and, wandering, each his several way END
BEGIN NOW Pursues, as inclination or sad choice END
BEGIN NOW Leads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find END
BEGIN NOW Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain END
BEGIN NOW The irksome hours, till his great Chief return. END
BEGIN NOW Part on the plain, or in the air sublime, END
BEGIN NOW Upon the wing or in swift race contend, END
BEGIN NOW As at th' Olympian games or Pythian fields; END
BEGIN NOW Part curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal END
BEGIN NOW With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form: END
BEGIN NOW As when, to warn proud cities, war appears END
BEGIN NOW Waged in the troubled sky, and armies rush END
BEGIN NOW To battle in the clouds; before each van END
BEGIN NOW Prick forth the airy knights, and couch their spears, END
BEGIN NOW Till thickest legions close; with feats of arms END
BEGIN NOW From either end of heaven the welkin burns. END
BEGIN NOW Others, with vast Typhoean rage, more fell, END
BEGIN NOW Rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air END
BEGIN NOW In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wild uproar:-- END
BEGIN NOW As when Alcides, from Oechalia crowned END
BEGIN NOW With conquest, felt th' envenomed robe, and tore END
BEGIN NOW Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines, END
BEGIN NOW And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw END
BEGIN NOW Into th' Euboic sea. Others, more mild, END
BEGIN NOW Retreated in a silent valley, sing END
BEGIN NOW With notes angelical to many a harp END
BEGIN NOW Their own heroic deeds, and hapless fall END
BEGIN NOW By doom of battle, and complain that Fate END
BEGIN NOW Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance. END
BEGIN NOW Their song was partial; but the harmony END
BEGIN NOW (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) END
BEGIN NOW Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment END
BEGIN NOW The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet END
BEGIN NOW (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense) END
BEGIN NOW Others apart sat on a hill retired, END
BEGIN NOW In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high END
BEGIN NOW Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute, END
BEGIN NOW And found no end, in wandering mazes lost. END
BEGIN NOW Of good and evil much they argued then, END
BEGIN NOW Of happiness and final misery, END
BEGIN NOW Passion and apathy, and glory and shame: END
BEGIN NOW Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy!-- END
BEGIN NOW Yet, with a pleasing sorcery, could charm END
BEGIN NOW Pain for a while or anguish, and excite END
BEGIN NOW Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured breast END
BEGIN NOW With stubborn patience as with triple steel. END
BEGIN NOW Another part, in squadrons and gross bands, END
BEGIN NOW On bold adventure to discover wide END
BEGIN NOW That dismal world, if any clime perhaps END
BEGIN NOW Might yield them easier habitation, bend END
BEGIN NOW Four ways their flying march, along the banks END
BEGIN NOW Of four infernal rivers, that disgorge END
BEGIN NOW Into the burning lake their baleful streams-- END
BEGIN NOW Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate; END
BEGIN NOW Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep; END
BEGIN NOW Cocytus, named of lamentation loud END
BEGIN NOW Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton, END
BEGIN NOW Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. END
BEGIN NOW Far off from these, a slow and silent stream, END
BEGIN NOW Lethe, the river of oblivion, rolls END
BEGIN NOW Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith his former state and being forgets-- END
BEGIN NOW Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. END
BEGIN NOW Beyond this flood a frozen continent END
BEGIN NOW Lies dark and wild, beat with perpetual storms END
BEGIN NOW Of whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land END
BEGIN NOW Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems END
BEGIN NOW Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, END
BEGIN NOW A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old, END
BEGIN NOW Where armies whole have sunk: the parching air END
BEGIN NOW Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of fire. END
BEGIN NOW Thither, by harpy-footed Furies haled, END
BEGIN NOW At certain revolutions all the damned END
BEGIN NOW Are brought; and feel by turns the bitter change END
BEGIN NOW Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce, END
BEGIN NOW From beds of raging fire to starve in ice END
BEGIN NOW Their soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine END
BEGIN NOW Immovable, infixed, and frozen round END
BEGIN NOW Periods of time,--thence hurried back to fire. END
BEGIN NOW They ferry over this Lethean sound END
BEGIN NOW Both to and fro, their sorrow to augment, END
BEGIN NOW And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach END
BEGIN NOW The tempting stream, with one small drop to lose END
BEGIN NOW In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, END
BEGIN NOW All in one moment, and so near the brink; END
BEGIN NOW But Fate withstands, and, to oppose th' attempt, END
BEGIN NOW Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards END
BEGIN NOW The ford, and of itself the water flies END
BEGIN NOW All taste of living wight, as once it fled END
BEGIN NOW The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on END
BEGIN NOW In confused march forlorn, th' adventurous bands, END
BEGIN NOW With shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast, END
BEGIN NOW Viewed first their lamentable lot, and found END
BEGIN NOW No rest. Through many a dark and dreary vale END
BEGIN NOW They passed, and many a region dolorous, END
BEGIN NOW O'er many a frozen, many a fiery alp, END
BEGIN NOW Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death-- END
BEGIN NOW A universe of death, which God by curse END
BEGIN NOW Created evil, for evil only good; END
BEGIN NOW Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds, END
BEGIN NOW Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, END
BEGIN NOW Obominable, inutterable, and worse END
BEGIN NOW Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived, END
BEGIN NOW Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras dire. END
BEGIN NOW Satan, with thoughts inflamed of highest design, END
BEGIN NOW Puts on swift wings, and toward the gates of Hell END
BEGIN NOW Explores his solitary flight: sometimes END
BEGIN NOW He scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left; END
BEGIN NOW Now shaves with level wing the deep, then soars END
BEGIN NOW Up to the fiery concave towering high. END
BEGIN NOW As when far off at sea a fleet descried END
BEGIN NOW Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds END
BEGIN NOW Close sailing from Bengala, or the isles END
BEGIN NOW Of Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants bring END
BEGIN NOW Their spicy drugs; they on the trading flood, END
BEGIN NOW Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape, END
BEGIN NOW Ply stemming nightly toward the pole: so seemed END
BEGIN NOW Far off the flying Fiend. At last appear END
BEGIN NOW Hell-bounds, high reaching to the horrid roof, END
BEGIN NOW And thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass, END
BEGIN NOW Three iron, three of adamantine rock, END
BEGIN NOW Impenetrable, impaled with circling fire, END
BEGIN NOW Yet unconsumed. Before the gates there sat END
BEGIN NOW On either side a formidable Shape. END
BEGIN NOW The one seemed woman to the waist, and fair, END
BEGIN NOW But ended foul in many a scaly fold, END
BEGIN NOW Voluminous and vast--a serpent armed END
BEGIN NOW With mortal sting. About her middle round END
BEGIN NOW A cry of Hell-hounds never-ceasing barked END
BEGIN NOW With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung END
BEGIN NOW A hideous peal; yet, when they list, would creep, END
BEGIN NOW If aught disturbed their noise, into her womb, END
BEGIN NOW And kennel there; yet there still barked and howled END
BEGIN NOW Within unseen. Far less abhorred than these END
BEGIN NOW Vexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts END
BEGIN NOW Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore; END
BEGIN NOW Nor uglier follow the night-hag, when, called END
BEGIN NOW In secret, riding through the air she comes, END
BEGIN NOW Lured with the smell of infant blood, to dance END
BEGIN NOW With Lapland witches, while the labouring moon END
BEGIN NOW Eclipses at their charms. The other Shape-- END
BEGIN NOW If shape it might be called that shape had none END
BEGIN NOW Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb; END
BEGIN NOW Or substance might be called that shadow seemed, END
BEGIN NOW For each seemed either--black it stood as Night, END
BEGIN NOW Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, END
BEGIN NOW And shook a dreadful dart: what seemed his head END
BEGIN NOW The likeness of a kingly crown had on. END
BEGIN NOW Satan was now at hand, and from his seat END
BEGIN NOW The monster moving onward came as fast END
BEGIN NOW With horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode. END
BEGIN NOW Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admired-- END
BEGIN NOW Admired, not feared (God and his Son except, END
BEGIN NOW Created thing naught valued he nor shunned), END
BEGIN NOW And with disdainful look thus first began:-- END
BEGIN NOW Whence and what art thou, execrable Shape, END
BEGIN NOW That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance END
BEGIN NOW Thy miscreated front athwart my way END
BEGIN NOW To yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass, END
BEGIN NOW That be assured, without leave asked of thee. END
BEGIN NOW Retire; or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, END
BEGIN NOW Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Goblin, full of wrath, replied:-- END
BEGIN NOW Art thou that traitor Angel? art thou he, END
BEGIN NOW Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith, till then END
BEGIN NOW Unbroken, and in proud rebellious arms END
BEGIN NOW Drew after him the third part of Heaven's sons, END
BEGIN NOW Conjured against the Highest--for which both thou END
BEGIN NOW And they, outcast from God, are here condemned END
BEGIN NOW To waste eternal days in woe and pain? END
BEGIN NOW And reckon'st thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Hell-doomed, and breath'st defiance here and scorn, END
BEGIN NOW Where I reign king, and, to enrage thee more, END
BEGIN NOW Thy king and lord? Back to thy punishment, END
BEGIN NOW False fugitive; and to thy speed add wings, END
BEGIN NOW Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue END
BEGIN NOW Thy lingering, or with one stroke of this dart END
BEGIN NOW Strange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the grisly Terror, and in shape, END
BEGIN NOW So speaking and so threatening, grew tenfold, END
BEGIN NOW More dreadful and deform. On th' other side, END
BEGIN NOW Incensed with indignation, Satan stood END
BEGIN NOW Unterrified, and like a comet burned, END
BEGIN NOW That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge END
BEGIN NOW In th' arctic sky, and from his horrid hair END
BEGIN NOW Shakes pestilence and war. Each at the head END
BEGIN NOW Levelled his deadly aim; their fatal hands END
BEGIN NOW No second stroke intend; and such a frown END
BEGIN NOW Each cast at th' other as when two black clouds, END
BEGIN NOW With heaven's artillery fraught, came rattling on END
BEGIN NOW Over the Caspian,--then stand front to front END
BEGIN NOW Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow END
BEGIN NOW To join their dark encounter in mid-air. END
BEGIN NOW So frowned the mighty combatants that Hell END
BEGIN NOW Grew darker at their frown; so matched they stood; END
BEGIN NOW For never but once more was wither like END
BEGIN NOW To meet so great a foe. And now great deeds END
BEGIN NOW Had been achieved, whereof all Hell had rung, END
BEGIN NOW Had not the snaky Sorceress, that sat END
BEGIN NOW Fast by Hell-gate and kept the fatal key, END
BEGIN NOW Risen, and with hideous outcry rushed between. END
BEGIN NOW O father, what intends thy hand," she cried, END
BEGIN NOW Against thy only son? What fury, O son, END
BEGIN NOW Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart END
BEGIN NOW Against thy father's head? And know'st for whom? END
BEGIN NOW For him who sits above, and laughs the while END
BEGIN NOW At thee, ordained his drudge to execute END
BEGIN NOW Whate'er his wrath, which he calls justice, bids-- END
BEGIN NOW His wrath, which one day will destroy ye both! END
BEGIN NOW She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest END
BEGIN NOW Forbore: then these to her Satan returned:-- END
BEGIN NOW So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange END
BEGIN NOW Thou interposest, that my sudden hand, END
BEGIN NOW Prevented, spares to tell thee yet by deeds END
BEGIN NOW What it intends, till first I know of thee END
BEGIN NOW What thing thou art, thus double-formed, and why, END
BEGIN NOW In this infernal vale first met, thou call'st END
BEGIN NOW Me father, and that phantasm call'st my son. END
BEGIN NOW I know thee not, nor ever saw till now END
BEGIN NOW Sight more detestable than him and thee. END
BEGIN NOW T' whom thus the Portress of Hell-gate replied:-- END
BEGIN NOW Hast thou forgot me, then; and do I seem END
BEGIN NOW Now in thine eye so foul?--once deemed so fair END
BEGIN NOW In Heaven, when at th' assembly, and in sight END
BEGIN NOW Of all the Seraphim with thee combined END
BEGIN NOW In bold conspiracy against Heaven's King, END
BEGIN NOW All on a sudden miserable pain END
BEGIN NOW Surprised thee, dim thine eyes and dizzy swum END
BEGIN NOW In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast END
BEGIN NOW Threw forth, till on the left side opening wide, END
BEGIN NOW Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright, END
BEGIN NOW Then shining heavenly fair, a goddess armed, END
BEGIN NOW Out of thy head I sprung. Amazement seized END
BEGIN NOW All th' host of Heaven; back they recoiled afraid END
BEGIN NOW At first, and called me Sin, and for a sign END
BEGIN NOW Portentous held me; but, familiar grown, END
BEGIN NOW I pleased, and with attractive graces won END
BEGIN NOW The most averse--thee chiefly, who, full oft END
BEGIN NOW Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing, END
BEGIN NOW Becam'st enamoured; and such joy thou took'st END
BEGIN NOW With me in secret that my womb conceived END
BEGIN NOW A growing burden. Meanwhile war arose, END
BEGIN NOW And fields were fought in Heaven: wherein remained END
BEGIN NOW (For what could else?) to our Almighty Foe END
BEGIN NOW Clear victory; to our part loss and rout END
BEGIN NOW Through all the Empyrean. Down they fell, END
BEGIN NOW Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven, down END
BEGIN NOW Into this Deep; and in the general fall END
BEGIN NOW I also: at which time this powerful key END
BEGIN NOW Into my hands was given, with charge to keep END
BEGIN NOW These gates for ever shut, which none can pass END
BEGIN NOW Without my opening. Pensive here I sat END
BEGIN NOW Alone; but long I sat not, till my womb, END
BEGIN NOW Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown, END
BEGIN NOW Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. END
BEGIN NOW At last this odious offspring whom thou seest, END
BEGIN NOW Thine own begotten, breaking violent way, END
BEGIN NOW Tore through my entrails, that, with fear and pain END
BEGIN NOW Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew END
BEGIN NOW Transformed: but he my inbred enemy END
BEGIN NOW Forth issued, brandishing his fatal dart, END
BEGIN NOW Made to destroy. I fled, and cried out Death! END
BEGIN NOW Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sighed END
BEGIN NOW From all her caves, and back resounded Death! END
BEGIN NOW I fled; but he pursued (though more, it seems, END
BEGIN NOW Inflamed with lust than rage), and, swifter far, END
BEGIN NOW Me overtook, his mother, all dismayed, END
BEGIN NOW And, in embraces forcible and foul END
BEGIN NOW Engendering with me, of that rape begot END
BEGIN NOW These yelling monsters, that with ceaseless cry END
BEGIN NOW Surround me, as thou saw'st--hourly conceived END
BEGIN NOW And hourly born, with sorrow infinite END
BEGIN NOW To me; for, when they list, into the womb END
BEGIN NOW That bred them they return, and howl, and gnaw END
BEGIN NOW My bowels, their repast; then, bursting forth END
BEGIN NOW Afresh, with conscious terrors vex me round, END
BEGIN NOW That rest or intermission none I find. END
BEGIN NOW Before mine eyes in opposition sits END
BEGIN NOW Grim Death, my son and foe, who set them on, END
BEGIN NOW And me, his parent, would full soon devour END
BEGIN NOW For want of other prey, but that he knows END
BEGIN NOW His end with mine involved, and knows that I END
BEGIN NOW Should prove a bitter morsel, and his bane, END
BEGIN NOW Whenever that shall be: so Fate pronounced. END
BEGIN NOW But thou, O father, I forewarn thee, shun END
BEGIN NOW His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope END
BEGIN NOW To be invulnerable in those bright arms, END
BEGIN NOW Through tempered heavenly; for that mortal dint, END
BEGIN NOW Save he who reigns above, none can resist. END
BEGIN NOW She finished; and the subtle Fiend his lore END
BEGIN NOW Soon learned, now milder, and thus answered smooth:-- END
BEGIN NOW Dear daughter--since thou claim'st me for thy sire, END
BEGIN NOW And my fair son here show'st me, the dear pledge END
BEGIN NOW Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven, and joys END
BEGIN NOW Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change END
BEGIN NOW Befallen us unforeseen, unthought-of--know, END
BEGIN NOW I come no enemy, but to set free END
BEGIN NOW From out this dark and dismal house of pain END
BEGIN NOW Both him and thee, and all the heavenly host END
BEGIN NOW Of Spirits that, in our just pretences armed, END
BEGIN NOW Fell with us from on high. From them I go END
BEGIN NOW This uncouth errand sole, and one for all END
BEGIN NOW Myself expose, with lonely steps to tread END
BEGIN NOW Th' unfounded Deep, and through the void immense END
BEGIN NOW To search, with wandering quest, a place foretold END
BEGIN NOW Should be--and, by concurring signs, ere now END
BEGIN NOW Created vast and round--a place of bliss END
BEGIN NOW In the purlieus of Heaven; and therein placed END
BEGIN NOW A race of upstart creatures, to supply END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps our vacant room, though more removed, END
BEGIN NOW Lest Heaven, surcharged with potent multitude, END
BEGIN NOW Might hap to move new broils. Be this, or aught END
BEGIN NOW Than this more secret, now designed, I haste END
BEGIN NOW To know; and, this once known, shall soon return, END
BEGIN NOW And bring ye to the place where thou and Death END
BEGIN NOW Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen END
BEGIN NOW Wing silently the buxom air, embalmed END
BEGIN NOW With odours. There ye shall be fed and filled END
BEGIN NOW Immeasurably; all things shall be your prey. END
BEGIN NOW He ceased; for both seemed highly pleased, and Death END
BEGIN NOW Grinned horrible a ghastly smile, to hear END
BEGIN NOW His famine should be filled, and blessed his maw END
BEGIN NOW Destined to that good hour. No less rejoiced END
BEGIN NOW His mother bad, and thus bespake her sire:-- END
BEGIN NOW The key of this infernal Pit, by due END
BEGIN NOW And by command of Heaven's all-powerful King, END
BEGIN NOW I keep, by him forbidden to unlock END
BEGIN NOW These adamantine gates; against all force END
BEGIN NOW Death ready stands to interpose his dart, END
BEGIN NOW Fearless to be o'ermatched by living might. END
BEGIN NOW But what owe I to his commands above, END
BEGIN NOW Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down END
BEGIN NOW Into this gloom of Tartarus profound, END
BEGIN NOW To sit in hateful office here confined, END
BEGIN NOW Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born-- END
BEGIN NOW Here in perpetual agony and pain, END
BEGIN NOW With terrors and with clamours compassed round END
BEGIN NOW Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed? END
BEGIN NOW Thou art my father, thou my author, thou END
BEGIN NOW My being gav'st me; whom should I obey END
BEGIN NOW But thee? whom follow? Thou wilt bring me soon END
BEGIN NOW To that new world of light and bliss, among END
BEGIN NOW The gods who live at ease, where I shall reign END
BEGIN NOW At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems END
BEGIN NOW Thy daughter and thy darling, without end. END
BEGIN NOW Thus saying, from her side the fatal key, END
BEGIN NOW Sad instrument of all our woe, she took; END
BEGIN NOW And, towards the gate rolling her bestial train, END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith the huge portcullis high up-drew, END
BEGIN NOW Which, but herself, not all the Stygian Powers END
BEGIN NOW Could once have moved; then in the key-hole turns END
BEGIN NOW Th' intricate wards, and every bolt and bar END
BEGIN NOW Of massy iron or solid rock with ease END
BEGIN NOW Unfastens. On a sudden open fly, END
BEGIN NOW With impetuous recoil and jarring sound, END
BEGIN NOW Th' infernal doors, and on their hinges grate END
BEGIN NOW Harsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook END
BEGIN NOW Of Erebus. She opened; but to shut END
BEGIN NOW Excelled her power: the gates wide open stood, END
BEGIN NOW That with extended wings a bannered host, END
BEGIN NOW Under spread ensigns marching, might pass through END
BEGIN NOW With horse and chariots ranked in loose array; END
BEGIN NOW So wide they stood, and like a furnace-mouth END
BEGIN NOW Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame. END
BEGIN NOW Before their eyes in sudden view appear END
BEGIN NOW The secrets of the hoary Deep--a dark END
BEGIN NOW Illimitable ocean, without bound, END
BEGIN NOW Without dimension; where length, breadth, and height, END
BEGIN NOW And time, and place, are lost; where eldest Night END
BEGIN NOW And Chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold END
BEGIN NOW Eternal anarchy, amidst the noise END
BEGIN NOW Of endless wars, and by confusion stand. END
BEGIN NOW For Hot, Cold, Moist, and Dry, four champions fierce, END
BEGIN NOW Strive here for mastery, and to battle bring END
BEGIN NOW Their embryon atoms: they around the flag END
BEGIN NOW Of each his faction, in their several clans, END
BEGIN NOW Light-armed or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift, or slow, END
BEGIN NOW Swarm populous, unnumbered as the sands END
BEGIN NOW Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil, END
BEGIN NOW Levied to side with warring winds, and poise END
BEGIN NOW Their lighter wings. To whom these most adhere END
BEGIN NOW He rules a moment: Chaos umpire sits, END
BEGIN NOW And by decision more embroils the fray END
BEGIN NOW By which he reigns: next him, high arbiter, END
BEGIN NOW Chance governs all. Into this wild Abyss, END
BEGIN NOW The womb of Nature, and perhaps her grave, END
BEGIN NOW Of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire, END
BEGIN NOW But all these in their pregnant causes mixed END
BEGIN NOW Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight, END
BEGIN NOW Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain END
BEGIN NOW His dark materials to create more worlds-- END
BEGIN NOW Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend END
BEGIN NOW Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while, END
BEGIN NOW Pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith END
BEGIN NOW He had to cross. Nor was his ear less pealed END
BEGIN NOW With noises loud and ruinous (to compare END
BEGIN NOW Great things with small) than when Bellona storms END
BEGIN NOW With all her battering engines, bent to rase END
BEGIN NOW Some capital city; or less than if this frame END
BEGIN NOW Of Heaven were falling, and these elements END
BEGIN NOW In mutiny had from her axle torn END
BEGIN NOW The steadfast Earth. At last his sail-broad vans END
BEGIN NOW He spread for flight, and, in the surging smoke END
BEGIN NOW Uplifted, spurns the ground; thence many a league, END
BEGIN NOW As in a cloudy chair, ascending rides END
BEGIN NOW Audacious; but, that seat soon failing, meets END
BEGIN NOW A vast vacuity. All unawares, END
BEGIN NOW Fluttering his pennons vain, plumb-down he drops END
BEGIN NOW Ten thousand fathom deep, and to this hour END
BEGIN NOW Down had been falling, had not, by ill chance, END
BEGIN NOW The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud, END
BEGIN NOW Instinct with fire and nitre, hurried him END
BEGIN NOW As many miles aloft. That fury stayed-- END
BEGIN NOW Quenched in a boggy Syrtis, neither sea, END
BEGIN NOW Nor good dry land--nigh foundered, on he fares, END
BEGIN NOW Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, END
BEGIN NOW Half flying; behoves him now both oar and sail. END
BEGIN NOW As when a gryphon through the wilderness END
BEGIN NOW With winged course, o'er hill or moory dale, END
BEGIN NOW Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth END
BEGIN NOW Had from his wakeful custody purloined END
BEGIN NOW The guarded gold; so eagerly the Fiend END
BEGIN NOW O'er bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, END
BEGIN NOW With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way, END
BEGIN NOW And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies. END
BEGIN NOW At length a universal hubbub wild END
BEGIN NOW Of stunning sounds, and voices all confused, END
BEGIN NOW Borne through the hollow dark, assaults his ear END
BEGIN NOW With loudest vehemence. Thither he plies END
BEGIN NOW Undaunted, to meet there whatever Power END
BEGIN NOW Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss END
BEGIN NOW Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask END
BEGIN NOW Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies END
BEGIN NOW Bordering on light; when straight behold the throne END
BEGIN NOW Of Chaos, and his dark pavilion spread END
BEGIN NOW Wide on the wasteful Deep! With him enthroned END
BEGIN NOW Sat sable-vested Night, eldest of things, END
BEGIN NOW The consort of his reign; and by them stood END
BEGIN NOW Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name END
BEGIN NOW Of Demogorgon; Rumour next, and Chance, END
BEGIN NOW And Tumult, and Confusion, all embroiled, END
BEGIN NOW And Discord with a thousand various mouths. END
BEGIN NOW T' whom Satan, turning boldly, thus:--"Ye Powers END
BEGIN NOW And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss, END
BEGIN NOW Chaos and ancient Night, I come no spy END
BEGIN NOW With purpose to explore or to disturb END
BEGIN NOW The secrets of your realm; but, by constraint END
BEGIN NOW Wandering this darksome desert, as my way END
BEGIN NOW Lies through your spacious empire up to light, END
BEGIN NOW Alone and without guide, half lost, I seek, END
BEGIN NOW What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds END
BEGIN NOW Confine with Heaven; or, if some other place, END
BEGIN NOW From your dominion won, th' Ethereal King END
BEGIN NOW Possesses lately, thither to arrive END
BEGIN NOW I travel this profound. Direct my course: END
BEGIN NOW Directed, no mean recompense it brings END
BEGIN NOW To your behoof, if I that region lost, END
BEGIN NOW All usurpation thence expelled, reduce END
BEGIN NOW To her original darkness and your sway END
BEGIN NOW (Which is my present journey), and once more END
BEGIN NOW Erect the standard there of ancient Night. END
BEGIN NOW Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge! END
BEGIN NOW Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old, END
BEGIN NOW With faltering speech and visage incomposed, END
BEGIN NOW Answered: "I know thee, stranger, who thou art-- END
BEGIN NOW That mighty leading Angel, who of late END
BEGIN NOW Made head against Heaven's King, though overthrown. END
BEGIN NOW I saw and heard; for such a numerous host END
BEGIN NOW Fled not in silence through the frighted Deep, END
BEGIN NOW With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, END
BEGIN NOW Confusion worse confounded; and Heaven-gates END
BEGIN NOW Poured out by millions her victorious bands, END
BEGIN NOW Pursuing. I upon my frontiers here END
BEGIN NOW Keep residence; if all I can will serve END
BEGIN NOW That little which is left so to defend, END
BEGIN NOW Encroached on still through our intestine broils END
BEGIN NOW Weakening the sceptre of old Night: first, Hell, END
BEGIN NOW Your dungeon, stretching far and wide beneath; END
BEGIN NOW Now lately Heaven and Earth, another world END
BEGIN NOW Hung o'er my realm, linked in a golden chain END
BEGIN NOW To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell! END
BEGIN NOW If that way be your walk, you have not far; END
BEGIN NOW So much the nearer danger. Go, and speed; END
BEGIN NOW Havoc, and spoil, and ruin, are my gain. END
BEGIN NOW He ceased; and Satan stayed not to reply, END
BEGIN NOW But, glad that now his sea should find a shore, END
BEGIN NOW With fresh alacrity and force renewed END
BEGIN NOW Springs upward, like a pyramid of fire, END
BEGIN NOW Into the wild expanse, and through the shock END
BEGIN NOW Of fighting elements, on all sides round END
BEGIN NOW Environed, wins his way; harder beset END
BEGIN NOW And more endangered than when Argo passed END
BEGIN NOW Through Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks, END
BEGIN NOW Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned END
BEGIN NOW Charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steered. END
BEGIN NOW So he with difficulty and labour hard END
BEGIN NOW Moved on, with difficulty and labour he; END
BEGIN NOW But, he once passed, soon after, when Man fell, END
BEGIN NOW Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain, END
BEGIN NOW Following his track (such was the will of Heaven) END
BEGIN NOW Paved after him a broad and beaten way END
BEGIN NOW Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling gulf END
BEGIN NOW Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length, END
BEGIN NOW From Hell continued, reaching th' utmost orb END
BEGIN NOW Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse END
BEGIN NOW With easy intercourse pass to and fro END
BEGIN NOW To tempt or punish mortals, except whom END
BEGIN NOW God and good Angels guard by special grace. END
BEGIN NOW But now at last the sacred influence END
BEGIN NOW Of light appears, and from the walls of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night END
BEGIN NOW A glimmering dawn. Here Nature first begins END
BEGIN NOW Her farthest verge, and Chaos to retire, END
BEGIN NOW As from her outmost works, a broken foe, END
BEGIN NOW With tumult less and with less hostile din; END
BEGIN NOW That Satan with less toil, and now with ease, END
BEGIN NOW Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light, END
BEGIN NOW And, like a weather-beaten vessel, holds END
BEGIN NOW Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn; END
BEGIN NOW Or in the emptier waste, resembling air, END
BEGIN NOW Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold END
BEGIN NOW Far off th' empyreal Heaven, extended wide END
BEGIN NOW In circuit, undetermined square or round, END
BEGIN NOW With opal towers and battlements adorned END
BEGIN NOW Of living sapphire, once his native seat; END
BEGIN NOW And, fast by, hanging in a golden chain, END
BEGIN NOW This pendent World, in bigness as a star END
BEGIN NOW Of smallest magnitude close by the moon. END
BEGIN NOW Thither, full fraught with mischievous revenge, END
BEGIN NOW Accursed, and in a cursed hour, he hies. END
BEGIN NOW Hail, holy Light, offspring of Heaven firstborn, END
BEGIN NOW Or of the Eternal coeternal beam END
BEGIN NOW May I express thee unblam'd? since God is light, END
BEGIN NOW And never but in unapproached light END
BEGIN NOW Dwelt from eternity, dwelt then in thee END
BEGIN NOW Bright effluence of bright essence increate. END
BEGIN NOW Or hear'st thou rather pure ethereal stream, END
BEGIN NOW Whose fountain who shall tell? before the sun, END
BEGIN NOW Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice END
BEGIN NOW Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest END
BEGIN NOW The rising world of waters dark and deep, END
BEGIN NOW Won from the void and formless infinite. END
BEGIN NOW Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing, END
BEGIN NOW Escap'd the Stygian pool, though long detain'd END
BEGIN NOW In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight END
BEGIN NOW Through utter and through middle darkness borne, END
BEGIN NOW With other notes than to the Orphean lyre END
BEGIN NOW I sung of Chaos and eternal Night; END
BEGIN NOW Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down END
BEGIN NOW The dark descent, and up to re-ascend, END
BEGIN NOW Though hard and rare: Thee I revisit safe, END
BEGIN NOW And feel thy sovran vital lamp; but thou END
BEGIN NOW Revisit'st not these eyes, that roll in vain END
BEGIN NOW To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn; END
BEGIN NOW So thick a drop serene hath quench'd their orbs, END
BEGIN NOW Or dim suffusion veil'd. Yet not the more END
BEGIN NOW Cease I to wander, where the Muses haunt, END
BEGIN NOW Clear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill, END
BEGIN NOW Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief END
BEGIN NOW Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath, END
BEGIN NOW That wash thy hallow'd feet, and warbling flow, END
BEGIN NOW Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget END
BEGIN NOW So were I equall'd with them in renown, END
BEGIN NOW Thy sovran command, that Man should find grace; END
BEGIN NOW Blind Thamyris, and blind Maeonides, END
BEGIN NOW And Tiresias, and Phineus, prophets old: END
BEGIN NOW Then feed on thoughts, that voluntary move END
BEGIN NOW Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful bird END
BEGIN NOW Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid END
BEGIN NOW Tunes her nocturnal note. Thus with the year END
BEGIN NOW Seasons return; but not to me returns END
BEGIN NOW Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn, END
BEGIN NOW Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer's rose, END
BEGIN NOW Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine; END
BEGIN NOW But cloud instead, and ever-during dark END
BEGIN NOW Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men END
BEGIN NOW Cut off, and for the book of knowledge fair END
BEGIN NOW Presented with a universal blank END
BEGIN NOW Of nature's works to me expung'd and ras'd, END
BEGIN NOW And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out. END
BEGIN NOW So much the rather thou, celestial Light, END
BEGIN NOW Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers END
BEGIN NOW Irradiate; there plant eyes, all mist from thence END
BEGIN NOW Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell END
BEGIN NOW Of things invisible to mortal sight. END
BEGIN NOW Now had the Almighty Father from above, END
BEGIN NOW From the pure empyrean where he sits END
BEGIN NOW High thron'd above all highth, bent down his eye END
BEGIN NOW His own works and their works at once to view: END
BEGIN NOW Stood thick as stars, and from his sight receiv'd END
BEGIN NOW Beatitude past utterance; on his right END
BEGIN NOW The radiant image of his glory sat, END
BEGIN NOW His only son; on earth he first beheld END
BEGIN NOW Our two first parents, yet the only two END
BEGIN NOW Of mankind in the happy garden plac'd END
BEGIN NOW Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love, END
BEGIN NOW Uninterrupted joy, unrivall'd love, END
BEGIN NOW In blissful solitude; he then survey'd END
BEGIN NOW Hell and the gulf between, and Satan there END
BEGIN NOW Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night END

BEGIN NOW Transports our Adversary? whom no bounds END
BEGIN NOW Prescrib'd no bars of Hell, nor all the chains END
BEGIN NOW Heap'd on him there, nor yet the main abyss END
BEGIN NOW Wide interrupt, can hold; so bent he seems END

BEGIN NOW When will and reason (reason also is choice) END
BEGIN NOW Useless and vain, of freedom both despoil'd, END

BEGIN NOW To whom the great Creator thus replied. END
BEGIN NOW O son, in whom my soul hath chief delight, END
BEGIN NOW Son of my bosom, Son who art alone. END
BEGIN NOW My word, my wisdom, and effectual might, END
BEGIN NOW All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are, all END
BEGIN NOW As my eternal purpose hath decreed; END
BEGIN NOW Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will; END
BEGIN NOW Yet not of will in him, but grace in me END
BEGIN NOW Freely vouchsaf'd; once more I will renew END
BEGIN NOW His lapsed powers, though forfeit; and enthrall'd END
BEGIN NOW By sin to foul exorbitant desires; END
BEGIN NOW Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand END
BEGIN NOW On even ground against his mortal foe; END
BEGIN NOW By me upheld, that he may know how frail END

BEGIN NOW All his deliverance, and to none but me. END
BEGIN NOW Some I have chosen of peculiar grace, END
BEGIN NOW Elect above the rest; so is my will: END
BEGIN NOW The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warn'd END
BEGIN NOW Their sinful state, and to appease betimes END
BEGIN NOW The incensed Deity, while offer'd grace END
BEGIN NOW Invites; for I will clear their senses dark, END
BEGIN NOW What may suffice, and soften stony hearts END
BEGIN NOW To pray, repent, and bring obedience due. END
BEGIN NOW To prayer, repentance, and obedience due, END
BEGIN NOW Though but endeavour'd with sincere intent, END
BEGIN NOW Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut. END
BEGIN NOW And I will place within them as a guide, END
BEGIN NOW My umpire Conscience; whom if they will hear, END
BEGIN NOW Light after light, well us'd, they shall attain, END
BEGIN NOW And to the end, persisting, safe arrive. END
BEGIN NOW This my long sufferance, and my day of grace, END
BEGIN NOW They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste; END
BEGIN NOW But hard be harden'd, blind be blinded more, END
BEGIN NOW That they may stumble on, and deeper fall; END
BEGIN NOW And none but such from mercy I exclude. END
BEGIN NOW But yet all is not done; Man disobeying, END
BEGIN NOW Disloyal, breaks his fealty, and sins END
BEGIN NOW Against the high supremacy of Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Affecting God-head, and, so losing all, END
BEGIN NOW To expiate his treason hath nought left, END
BEGIN NOW But to destruction sacred and devote, END
BEGIN NOW He, with his whole posterity, must die, END
BEGIN NOW Die he or justice must; unless for him END
BEGIN NOW Some other able, and as willing, pay END
BEGIN NOW The rigid satisfaction, death for death. END
BEGIN NOW Say, heavenly Powers, where shall we find such love? END
BEGIN NOW Which of you will be mortal, to redeem END
BEGIN NOW Man's mortal crime, and just the unjust to save? END
BEGIN NOW Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear? END
BEGIN NOW He ask'd, but all the heavenly quire stood mute, END
BEGIN NOW And silence was in Heaven: on Man's behalf END
BEGIN NOW Patron or intercessour none appear'd, END
BEGIN NOW Much less that durst upon his own head draw END
BEGIN NOW The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. END
BEGIN NOW And now without redemption all mankind END
BEGIN NOW Must have been lost, adjudg'd to Death and Hell END
BEGIN NOW By doom severe, had not the Son of God, END
BEGIN NOW In whom the fulness dwells of love divine, END
BEGIN NOW His dearest mediation thus renew'd. END
BEGIN NOW Father, thy word is past, Man shall find grace; END
BEGIN NOW And shall grace not find means, that finds her way, END
BEGIN NOW The speediest of thy winged messengers, END
BEGIN NOW To visit all thy creatures, and to all END
BEGIN NOW Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought? END
BEGIN NOW Happy for Man, so coming; he her aid END
BEGIN NOW Can never seek, once dead in sins, and lost; END
BEGIN NOW Atonement for himself, or offering meet, END
BEGIN NOW Indebted and undone, hath none to bring; END
BEGIN NOW Behold me then: me for him, life for life END
BEGIN NOW I offer: on me let thine anger fall; END
BEGIN NOW Account me Man; I for his sake will leave END
BEGIN NOW Thy bosom, and this glory next to thee END
BEGIN NOW Freely put off, and for him lastly die END
BEGIN NOW Well pleased; on me let Death wreak all his rage. END
BEGIN NOW Under his gloomy power I shall not long END
BEGIN NOW Lie vanquished. Thou hast given me to possess END
BEGIN NOW Life in myself for ever; by thee I live; END
BEGIN NOW Though now to Death I yield, and am his due, END
BEGIN NOW All that of me can die, yet, that debt paid, END
BEGIN NOW Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave END
BEGIN NOW His prey, nor suffer my unspotted soul END
BEGIN NOW For ever with corruption there to dwell; END
BEGIN NOW But I shall rise victorious, and subdue END
BEGIN NOW My vanquisher, spoiled of his vaunted spoil. END
BEGIN NOW Death his death's wound shall then receive, and stoop END
BEGIN NOW Inglorious, of his mortal sting disarmed; END
BEGIN NOW I through the ample air in triumph high END
BEGIN NOW Shall lead Hell captive maugre Hell, and show END
BEGIN NOW The powers of darkness bound. Thou, at the sight END
BEGIN NOW Pleased, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile, END
BEGIN NOW While, by thee raised, I ruin all my foes; END
BEGIN NOW Death last, and with his carcase glut the grave; END
BEGIN NOW Then, with the multitude of my redeemed, END
BEGIN NOW Shall enter Heaven, long absent, and return, END
BEGIN NOW Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud END
BEGIN NOW Of anger shall remain, but peace assured END
BEGIN NOW And reconcilement: wrath shall be no more END
BEGIN NOW Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire. END
BEGIN NOW His words here ended; but his meek aspect END
BEGIN NOW Silent yet spake, and breathed immortal love END
BEGIN NOW To mortal men, above which only shone END
BEGIN NOW Filial obedience: as a sacrifice END
BEGIN NOW Glad to be offered, he attends the will END
BEGIN NOW Of his great Father. Admiration seized END
BEGIN NOW All Heaven, what this might mean, and whither tend, END
BEGIN NOW Wondering; but soon th' Almighty thus replied: END
BEGIN NOW O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace END
BEGIN NOW Found out for mankind under wrath, O thou END
BEGIN NOW My sole complacence! Well thou know'st how dear END
BEGIN NOW To me are all my works; nor Man the least, END
BEGIN NOW Though last created, that for him I spare END
BEGIN NOW Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save, END
BEGIN NOW By losing thee a while, the whole race lost. END
BEGIN NOW Thou, therefore, whom thou only canst redeem, END
BEGIN NOW Their nature also to thy nature join; END
BEGIN NOW And be thyself Man among men on Earth, END
BEGIN NOW Made flesh, when time shall be, of virgin seed, END
BEGIN NOW By wondrous birth; be thou in Adam's room END
BEGIN NOW The head of all mankind, though Adam's son. END
BEGIN NOW As in him perish all men, so in thee, END
BEGIN NOW As from a second root, shall be restored END
BEGIN NOW As many as are restored, without thee none. END
BEGIN NOW His crime makes guilty all his sons; thy merit, END
BEGIN NOW Imputed, shall absolve them who renounce END
BEGIN NOW Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds, END
BEGIN NOW And live in thee transplanted, and from thee END
BEGIN NOW Receive new life. So Man, as is most just, END
BEGIN NOW Shall satisfy for Man, be judged and die, END
BEGIN NOW And dying rise, and rising with him raise END
BEGIN NOW His brethren, ransomed with his own dear life. END
BEGIN NOW So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate, END
BEGIN NOW Giving to death, and dying to redeem, END
BEGIN NOW So dearly to redeem what hellish hate END
BEGIN NOW So easily destroyed, and still destroys END
BEGIN NOW In those who, when they may, accept not grace. END
BEGIN NOW Nor shalt thou, by descending to assume END
BEGIN NOW Man's nature, lessen or degrade thine own. END
BEGIN NOW Because thou hast, though throned in highest bliss END
BEGIN NOW Equal to God, and equally enjoying END
BEGIN NOW God-like fruition, quitted all, to save END
BEGIN NOW A world from utter loss, and hast been found END
BEGIN NOW By merit more than birthright Son of God, END
BEGIN NOW Found worthiest to be so by being good, END
BEGIN NOW Far more than great or high; because in thee END
BEGIN NOW Love hath abounded more than glory abounds; END
BEGIN NOW Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt END
BEGIN NOW With thee thy manhood also to this throne: END
BEGIN NOW Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt reign END
BEGIN NOW Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man, END
BEGIN NOW Anointed universal King; all power END
BEGIN NOW I give thee; reign for ever, and assume END
BEGIN NOW Thy merits; under thee, as head supreme, END
BEGIN NOW Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions, I reduce: END
BEGIN NOW All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide END
BEGIN NOW In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell. END
BEGIN NOW When thou, attended gloriously from Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Shalt in the sky appear, and from thee send END
BEGIN NOW The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaim END
BEGIN NOW Thy dread tribunal; forthwith from all winds, END
BEGIN NOW The living, and forthwith the cited dead END
BEGIN NOW Of all past ages, to the general doom END
BEGIN NOW Shall hasten; such a peal shall rouse their sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Then, all thy saints assembled, thou shalt judge END
BEGIN NOW Bad Men and Angels; they, arraigned, shall sink END
BEGIN NOW Beneath thy sentence; Hell, her numbers full, END
BEGIN NOW Thenceforth shall be for ever shut. Mean while END
BEGIN NOW The world shall burn, and from her ashes spring END
BEGIN NOW New Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell, END
BEGIN NOW And, after all their tribulations long, END
BEGIN NOW See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds, END
BEGIN NOW With joy and peace triumphing, and fair truth. END
BEGIN NOW Then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by, END
BEGIN NOW For regal scepter then no more shall need, END
BEGIN NOW God shall be all in all. But, all ye Gods, END
BEGIN NOW Adore him, who to compass all this dies; END
BEGIN NOW Adore the Son, and honour him as me. END
BEGIN NOW No sooner had the Almighty ceased, but all END
BEGIN NOW The multitude of Angels, with a shout END
BEGIN NOW Loud as from numbers without number, sweet END
BEGIN NOW As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heaven rung END
BEGIN NOW With jubilee, and loud Hosannas filled END
BEGIN NOW The eternal regions: Lowly reverent END
BEGIN NOW Towards either throne they bow, and to the ground END
BEGIN NOW With solemn adoration down they cast END
BEGIN NOW Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold; END
BEGIN NOW Immortal amarant, a flower which once END
BEGIN NOW In Paradise, fast by the tree of life, END
BEGIN NOW Began to bloom; but soon for man's offence END
BEGIN NOW To Heaven removed, where first it grew, there grows, END
BEGIN NOW And flowers aloft shading the fount of life, END
BEGIN NOW And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Rolls o'er Elysian flowers her amber stream; END
BEGIN NOW With these that never fade the Spirits elect END
BEGIN NOW Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams; END
BEGIN NOW Now in loose garlands thick thrown off, the bright END
BEGIN NOW Pavement, that like a sea of jasper shone, END
BEGIN NOW Impurpled with celestial roses smiled. END
BEGIN NOW Then, crowned again, their golden harps they took, END
BEGIN NOW Harps ever tuned, that glittering by their side END
BEGIN NOW Like quivers hung, and with preamble sweet END
BEGIN NOW Of charming symphony they introduce END
BEGIN NOW Their sacred song, and waken raptures high; END
BEGIN NOW No voice exempt, no voice but well could join END
BEGIN NOW Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Thee, Father, first they sung Omnipotent, END
BEGIN NOW Eternal King; the Author of all being, END
BEGIN NOW Fountain of light, thyself invisible END
BEGIN NOW Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st END
BEGIN NOW Throned inaccessible, but when thou shadest END
BEGIN NOW The full blaze of thy beams, and, through a cloud END
BEGIN NOW Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine, END
BEGIN NOW Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear, END
BEGIN NOW Yet dazzle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim END
BEGIN NOW Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Thee next they sang of all creation first, END
BEGIN NOW In whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud END
BEGIN NOW Made visible, the Almighty Father shines, END
BEGIN NOW Whom else no creature can behold; on thee END
BEGIN NOW Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides, END
BEGIN NOW Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests. END
BEGIN NOW He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein END
BEGIN NOW By thee created; and by thee threw down END
BEGIN NOW The aspiring Dominations: Thou that day END
BEGIN NOW Thy Father's dreadful thunder didst not spare, END
BEGIN NOW Nor stop thy flaming chariot-wheels, that shook END
BEGIN NOW Heaven's everlasting frame, while o'er the necks END
BEGIN NOW Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed. END
BEGIN NOW Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim END
BEGIN NOW Thee only extolled, Son of thy Father's might, END
BEGIN NOW To execute fierce vengeance on his foes, END
BEGIN NOW Not so on Man: Him through their malice fallen, END
BEGIN NOW Father of mercy and grace, thou didst not doom END
BEGIN NOW So strictly, but much more to pity incline: END
BEGIN NOW No sooner did thy dear and only Son END
BEGIN NOW Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man END
BEGIN NOW So strictly, but much more to pity inclined, END
BEGIN NOW He to appease thy wrath, and end the strife END
BEGIN NOW Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned, END
BEGIN NOW Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat END
BEGIN NOW Second to thee, offered himself to die END
BEGIN NOW For Man's offence. O unexampled love, END
BEGIN NOW Love no where to be found less than Divine! END
BEGIN NOW Hail, Son of God, Saviour of Men! Thy name END
BEGIN NOW Shall be the copious matter of my song END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth, and never shall my heart thy praise END
BEGIN NOW Forget, nor from thy Father's praise disjoin. END
BEGIN NOW Thus they in Heaven, above the starry sphere, END
BEGIN NOW Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent. END
BEGIN NOW Mean while upon the firm opacous globe END
BEGIN NOW Of this round world, whose first convex divides END
BEGIN NOW The luminous inferiour orbs, enclosed END
BEGIN NOW From Chaos, and the inroad of Darkness old, END
BEGIN NOW Satan alighted walks: A globe far off END
BEGIN NOW It seemed, now seems a boundless continent END
BEGIN NOW Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night END
BEGIN NOW Starless exposed, and ever-threatening storms END
BEGIN NOW Of Chaos blustering round, inclement sky; END
BEGIN NOW Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Though distant far, some small reflection gains END
BEGIN NOW Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud: END
BEGIN NOW Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field. END
BEGIN NOW As when a vultur on Imaus bred, END
BEGIN NOW Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds, END
BEGIN NOW Dislodging from a region scarce of prey END
BEGIN NOW To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids, END
BEGIN NOW On hills where flocks are fed, flies toward the springs END
BEGIN NOW Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams; END
BEGIN NOW But in his way lights on the barren plains END
BEGIN NOW Of Sericana, where Chineses drive END
BEGIN NOW With sails and wind their cany waggons light: END
BEGIN NOW So, on this windy sea of land, the Fiend END
BEGIN NOW Walked up and down alone, bent on his prey; END
BEGIN NOW Alone, for other creature in this place, END
BEGIN NOW Living or lifeless, to be found was none; END
BEGIN NOW None yet, but store hereafter from the earth END
BEGIN NOW Up hither like aereal vapours flew END
BEGIN NOW Of all things transitory and vain, when sin END
BEGIN NOW With vanity had filled the works of men: END
BEGIN NOW Both all things vain, and all who in vain things END
BEGIN NOW Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame, END
BEGIN NOW Or happiness in this or the other life; END
BEGIN NOW All who have their reward on earth, the fruits END
BEGIN NOW Of painful superstition and blind zeal, END
BEGIN NOW Nought seeking but the praise of men, here find END
BEGIN NOW Fit retribution, empty as their deeds; END
BEGIN NOW All the unaccomplished works of Nature's hand, END
BEGIN NOW Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed, END
BEGIN NOW Dissolved on earth, fleet hither, and in vain, END
BEGIN NOW Till final dissolution, wander here; END
BEGIN NOW Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed; END
BEGIN NOW Those argent fields more likely habitants, END
BEGIN NOW Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt the angelical and human kind. END
BEGIN NOW Hither of ill-joined sons and daughters born END
BEGIN NOW First from the ancient world those giants came END
BEGIN NOW With many a vain exploit, though then renowned: END
BEGIN NOW The builders next of Babel on the plain END
BEGIN NOW Of Sennaar, and still with vain design, END
BEGIN NOW New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build: END
BEGIN NOW Others came single; he, who, to be deemed END
BEGIN NOW A God, leaped fondly into Aetna flames, END
BEGIN NOW Empedocles; and he, who, to enjoy END
BEGIN NOW Plato's Elysium, leaped into the sea, END
BEGIN NOW Cleombrotus; and many more too long, END
BEGIN NOW White, black, and gray, with all their trumpery. END
BEGIN NOW Here pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek END
BEGIN NOW In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heaven; END
BEGIN NOW And they, who to be sure of Paradise, END
BEGIN NOW Dying, put on the weeds of Dominick, END
BEGIN NOW Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised; END
BEGIN NOW They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed, END
BEGIN NOW And that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs END
BEGIN NOW The trepidation talked, and that first moved; END
BEGIN NOW And now Saint Peter at Heaven's wicket seems END
BEGIN NOW To wait them with his keys, and now at foot END
BEGIN NOW Of Heaven's ascent they lift their feet, when lo END
BEGIN NOW A violent cross wind from either coast END
BEGIN NOW Blows them transverse, ten thousand leagues awry END
BEGIN NOW Into the devious air: Then might ye see END
BEGIN NOW Cowls, hoods, and habits, with their wearers, tost END
BEGIN NOW And fluttered into rags; then reliques, beads, END
BEGIN NOW Indulgences, dispenses, pardons, bulls, END
BEGIN NOW The sport of winds: All these, upwhirled aloft, END
BEGIN NOW Fly o'er the backside of the world far off END
BEGIN NOW Into a Limbo large and broad, since called END
BEGIN NOW The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown END
BEGIN NOW Long after; now unpeopled, and untrod. END
BEGIN NOW All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed, END
BEGIN NOW And long he wandered, till at last a gleam END
BEGIN NOW Of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste END
BEGIN NOW His travelled steps: far distant he descries END
BEGIN NOW Ascending by degrees magnificent END
BEGIN NOW Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high; END
BEGIN NOW At top whereof, but far more rich, appeared END
BEGIN NOW The work as of a kingly palace-gate, END
BEGIN NOW With frontispiece of diamond and gold END
BEGIN NOW Embellished; thick with sparkling orient gems END
BEGIN NOW The portal shone, inimitable on earth END
BEGIN NOW By model, or by shading pencil, drawn. END
BEGIN NOW These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw END
BEGIN NOW Angels ascending and descending, bands END
BEGIN NOW Of guardians bright, when he from Esau fled END
BEGIN NOW To Padan-Aram, in the field of Luz END
BEGIN NOW Dreaming by night under the open sky END
BEGIN NOW And waking cried, This is the gate of Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood END
BEGIN NOW There always, but drawn up to Heaven sometimes END
BEGIN NOW Viewless; and underneath a bright sea flowed END
BEGIN NOW Of jasper, or of liquid pearl, whereon END
BEGIN NOW Who after came from earth, failing arrived END
BEGIN NOW Wafted by Angels, or flew o'er the lake END
BEGIN NOW Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds. END
BEGIN NOW The stairs were then let down, whether to dare END
BEGIN NOW The Fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate END
BEGIN NOW His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss: END
BEGIN NOW Direct against which opened from beneath, END
BEGIN NOW Just o'er the blissful seat of Paradise, END
BEGIN NOW A passage down to the Earth, a passage wide, END
BEGIN NOW Wider by far than that of after-times END
BEGIN NOW Over mount Sion, and, though that were large, END
BEGIN NOW Over the Promised Land to God so dear; END
BEGIN NOW By which, to visit oft those happy tribes, END
BEGIN NOW On high behests his angels to and fro END
BEGIN NOW Passed frequent, and his eye with choice regard END
BEGIN NOW From Paneas, the fount of Jordan's flood, END
BEGIN NOW To Beersaba, where the Holy Land END
BEGIN NOW So wide the opening seemed, where bounds were set END
BEGIN NOW To darkness, such as bound the ocean wave. END
BEGIN NOW Satan from hence, now on the lower stair, END
BEGIN NOW That scaled by steps of gold to Heaven-gate, END
BEGIN NOW Looks down with wonder at the sudden view END
BEGIN NOW Of all this world at once. As when a scout, END
BEGIN NOW Through dark and desert ways with peril gone END
BEGIN NOW All night; at last by break of cheerful dawn END
BEGIN NOW Obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill, END
BEGIN NOW Which to his eye discovers unaware END
BEGIN NOW The goodly prospect of some foreign land END
BEGIN NOW First seen, or some renowned metropolis END
BEGIN NOW With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned, END
BEGIN NOW Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams: END
BEGIN NOW Such wonder seised, though after Heaven seen, END
BEGIN NOW The Spirit malign, but much more envy seised, END
BEGIN NOW At sight of all this world beheld so fair. END
BEGIN NOW Round he surveys (and well might, where he stood END
BEGIN NOW So high above the circling canopy END
BEGIN NOW Of night's extended shade,) from eastern point END
BEGIN NOW Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears END
BEGIN NOW Andromeda far off Atlantick seas END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the horizon; then from pole to pole END
BEGIN NOW He views in breadth, and without longer pause END
BEGIN NOW Down right into the world's first region throws END
BEGIN NOW His flight precipitant, and winds with ease END
BEGIN NOW Through the pure marble air his oblique way END
BEGIN NOW Amongst innumerable stars, that shone END
BEGIN NOW Stars distant, but nigh hand seemed other worlds; END
BEGIN NOW Or other worlds they seemed, or happy isles, END
BEGIN NOW Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old, END
BEGIN NOW Fortunate fields, and groves, and flowery vales, END
BEGIN NOW Thrice happy isles; but who dwelt happy there END
BEGIN NOW He staid not to inquire: Above them all END
BEGIN NOW The golden sun, in splendour likest Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Allured his eye; thither his course he bends END
BEGIN NOW Through the calm firmament, (but up or down, END
BEGIN NOW By center, or eccentrick, hard to tell, END
BEGIN NOW Or longitude,) where the great luminary END
BEGIN NOW Aloof the vulgar constellations thick, END
BEGIN NOW That from his lordly eye keep distance due, END
BEGIN NOW Dispenses light from far; they, as they move END
BEGIN NOW Their starry dance in numbers that compute END
BEGIN NOW Days, months, and years, towards his all-cheering lamp END
BEGIN NOW Turn swift their various motions, or are turned END
BEGIN NOW By his magnetick beam, that gently warms END
BEGIN NOW The universe, and to each inward part END
BEGIN NOW With gentle penetration, though unseen, END
BEGIN NOW Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep; END
BEGIN NOW So wonderously was set his station bright. END
BEGIN NOW There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps END
BEGIN NOW Astronomer in the sun's lucent orb END
BEGIN NOW Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw. END
BEGIN NOW The place he found beyond expression bright, END
BEGIN NOW Compared with aught on earth, metal or stone; END
BEGIN NOW Not all parts like, but all alike informed END
BEGIN NOW With radiant light, as glowing iron with fire; END
BEGIN NOW If metal, part seemed gold, part silver clear; END
BEGIN NOW If stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite, END
BEGIN NOW Ruby or topaz, to the twelve that shone END
BEGIN NOW In Aaron's breast-plate, and a stone besides END
BEGIN NOW Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen, END
BEGIN NOW That stone, or like to that which here below END
BEGIN NOW Philosophers in vain so long have sought, END
BEGIN NOW In vain, though by their powerful art they bind END
BEGIN NOW Volatile Hermes, and call up unbound END
BEGIN NOW In various shapes old Proteus from the sea, END
BEGIN NOW Drained through a limbeck to his native form. END
BEGIN NOW What wonder then if fields and regions here END
BEGIN NOW Breathe forth Elixir pure, and rivers run END
BEGIN NOW Potable gold, when with one virtuous touch END
BEGIN NOW The arch-chemick sun, so far from us remote, END
BEGIN NOW Produces, with terrestrial humour mixed, END
BEGIN NOW Here in the dark so many precious things END
BEGIN NOW Of colour glorious, and effect so rare? END
BEGIN NOW Here matter new to gaze the Devil met END
BEGIN NOW Undazzled; far and wide his eye commands; END
BEGIN NOW For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, END
BEGIN NOW But all sun-shine, as when his beams at noon END
BEGIN NOW Culminate from the equator, as they now END
BEGIN NOW Shot upward still direct, whence no way round END
BEGIN NOW Shadow from body opaque can fall; and the air, END
BEGIN NOW No where so clear, sharpened his visual ray END
BEGIN NOW To objects distant far, whereby he soon END
BEGIN NOW Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand, END
BEGIN NOW The same whom John saw also in the sun: END
BEGIN NOW His back was turned, but not his brightness hid; END
BEGIN NOW Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar END
BEGIN NOW Circled his head, nor less his locks behind END
BEGIN NOW Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings END
BEGIN NOW Lay waving round; on some great charge employed END
BEGIN NOW He seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep. END
BEGIN NOW Glad was the Spirit impure, as now in hope END
BEGIN NOW To find who might direct his wandering flight END
BEGIN NOW To Paradise, the happy seat of Man, END
BEGIN NOW His journey's end and our beginning woe. END
BEGIN NOW But first he casts to change his proper shape, END
BEGIN NOW Which else might work him danger or delay: END
BEGIN NOW And now a stripling Cherub he appears, END
BEGIN NOW Not of the prime, yet such as in his face END
BEGIN NOW Youth smiled celestial, and to every limb END
BEGIN NOW Suitable grace diffused, so well he feigned: END
BEGIN NOW Under a coronet his flowing hair END
BEGIN NOW In curls on either cheek played; wings he wore END
BEGIN NOW Of many a coloured plume, sprinkled with gold; END
BEGIN NOW His habit fit for speed succinct, and held END
BEGIN NOW Before his decent steps a silver wand. END
BEGIN NOW He drew not nigh unheard; the Angel bright, END
BEGIN NOW Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turned, END
BEGIN NOW Admonished by his ear, and straight was known END
BEGIN NOW The Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seven END
BEGIN NOW Who in God's presence, nearest to his throne, END
BEGIN NOW Stand ready at command, and are his eyes END
BEGIN NOW That run through all the Heavens, or down to the Earth END
BEGIN NOW Bear his swift errands over moist and dry, END
BEGIN NOW O'er sea and land: him Satan thus accosts. END
BEGIN NOW Uriel, for thou of those seven Spirits that stand END
BEGIN NOW In sight of God's high throne, gloriously bright, END
BEGIN NOW The first art wont his great authentick will END
BEGIN NOW Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring, END
BEGIN NOW Where all his sons thy embassy attend; END
BEGIN NOW And here art likeliest by supreme decree END
BEGIN NOW Like honour to obtain, and as his eye END
BEGIN NOW To visit oft this new creation round; END
BEGIN NOW Unspeakable desire to see, and know END
BEGIN NOW All these his wonderous works, but chiefly Man, END
BEGIN NOW His chief delight and favour, him for whom END
BEGIN NOW All these his works so wonderous he ordained, END
BEGIN NOW Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim END
BEGIN NOW Alone thus wandering. Brightest Seraph, tell END
BEGIN NOW In which of all these shining orbs hath Man END
BEGIN NOW His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none, END
BEGIN NOW But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell; END
BEGIN NOW That I may find him, and with secret gaze END
BEGIN NOW Or open admiration him behold, END
BEGIN NOW On whom the great Creator hath bestowed END
BEGIN NOW Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces poured; END
BEGIN NOW That both in him and all things, as is meet, END
BEGIN NOW The universal Maker we may praise; END
BEGIN NOW Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes END
BEGIN NOW To deepest Hell, and, to repair that loss, END
BEGIN NOW Created this new happy race of Men END
BEGIN NOW To serve him better: Wise are all his ways. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the false dissembler unperceived; END
BEGIN NOW For neither Man nor Angel can discern END
BEGIN NOW Hypocrisy, the only evil that walks END
BEGIN NOW Invisible, except to God alone, END
BEGIN NOW By his permissive will, through Heaven and Earth: END
BEGIN NOW And oft, though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps END
BEGIN NOW At wisdom's gate, and to simplicity END
BEGIN NOW Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill END
BEGIN NOW Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguiled END
BEGIN NOW Uriel, though regent of the sun, and held END
BEGIN NOW The sharpest-sighted Spirit of all in Heaven; END
BEGIN NOW Who to the fraudulent impostor foul, END
BEGIN NOW In his uprightness, answer thus returned. END
BEGIN NOW Fair Angel, thy desire, which tends to know END
BEGIN NOW The works of God, thereby to glorify END
BEGIN NOW The great Work-master, leads to no excess END
BEGIN NOW That reaches blame, but rather merits praise END
BEGIN NOW The more it seems excess, that led thee hither END
BEGIN NOW From thy empyreal mansion thus alone, END
BEGIN NOW To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps, END
BEGIN NOW Contented with report, hear only in Heaven: END
BEGIN NOW For wonderful indeed are all his works, END
BEGIN NOW Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all END
BEGIN NOW Had in remembrance always with delight; END
BEGIN NOW But what created mind can comprehend END
BEGIN NOW Their number, or the wisdom infinite END
BEGIN NOW That brought them forth, but hid their causes deep? END
BEGIN NOW I saw when at his word the formless mass, END
BEGIN NOW This world's material mould, came to a heap: END
BEGIN NOW Confusion heard his voice, and wild uproar END
BEGIN NOW Stood ruled, stood vast infinitude confined; END
BEGIN NOW Till at his second bidding Darkness fled, END
BEGIN NOW Light shone, and order from disorder sprung: END
BEGIN NOW Swift to their several quarters hasted then END
BEGIN NOW The cumbrous elements, earth, flood, air, fire; END
BEGIN NOW And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Flew upward, spirited with various forms, END
BEGIN NOW That rolled orbicular, and turned to stars END
BEGIN NOW Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; END
BEGIN NOW Each had his place appointed, each his course; END
BEGIN NOW The rest in circuit walls this universe. END
BEGIN NOW Look downward on that globe, whose hither side END
BEGIN NOW With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; END
BEGIN NOW That place is Earth, the seat of Man; that light END
BEGIN NOW His day, which else, as the other hemisphere, END
BEGIN NOW Night would invade; but there the neighbouring moon END
BEGIN NOW (So call that opposite fair star) her aid END
BEGIN NOW Timely interposes, and her monthly round END
BEGIN NOW Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW With borrowed light her countenance triform END
BEGIN NOW Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth, END
BEGIN NOW And in her pale dominion checks the night. END
BEGIN NOW That spot, to which I point, is Paradise, END
BEGIN NOW Adam's abode; those lofty shades, his bower. END
BEGIN NOW Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. END
BEGIN NOW Thus said, he turned; and Satan, bowing low, END
BEGIN NOW As to superiour Spirits is wont in Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Where honour due and reverence none neglects, END
BEGIN NOW Took leave, and toward the coast of earth beneath, END
BEGIN NOW Down from the ecliptick, sped with hoped success, END
BEGIN NOW Throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel; END
BEGIN NOW Nor staid, till on Niphates' top he lights. END
BEGIN NOW O, for that warning voice, which he, who saw END
BEGIN NOW The Apocalypse, heard cry in Heaven aloud, END
BEGIN NOW Then when the Dragon, put to second rout, END
BEGIN NOW Came furious down to be revenged on men, END
BEGIN NOW Woe to the inhabitants on earth! that now, END
BEGIN NOW While time was, our first parents had been warned END
BEGIN NOW The coming of their secret foe, and 'scaped, END
BEGIN NOW Haply so 'scaped his mortal snare: For now END
BEGIN NOW Satan, now first inflamed with rage, came down, END
BEGIN NOW The tempter ere the accuser of mankind, END
BEGIN NOW To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss END
BEGIN NOW Of that first battle, and his flight to Hell: END
BEGIN NOW Yet, not rejoicing in his speed, though bold END
BEGIN NOW Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, END
BEGIN NOW Begins his dire attempt; which nigh the birth END
BEGIN NOW Now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast, END
BEGIN NOW And like a devilish engine back recoils END
BEGIN NOW Upon himself; horrour and doubt distract END
BEGIN NOW His troubled thoughts, and from the bottom stir END
BEGIN NOW The Hell within him; for within him Hell END
BEGIN NOW He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell END
BEGIN NOW One step, no more than from himself, can fly END
BEGIN NOW By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair, END
BEGIN NOW That slumbered; wakes the bitter memory END
BEGIN NOW Of what he was, what is, and what must be END
BEGIN NOW Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes towards Eden, which now in his view END
BEGIN NOW Lay pleasant, his grieved look he fixes sad; END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes towards Heaven, and the full-blazing sun, END
BEGIN NOW Which now sat high in his meridian tower: END
BEGIN NOW Then, much revolving, thus in sighs began. END
BEGIN NOW O thou, that, with surpassing glory crowned, END
BEGIN NOW Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God END
BEGIN NOW Of this new world; at whose sight all the stars END
BEGIN NOW Hide their diminished heads; to thee I call, END
BEGIN NOW But with no friendly voice, and add thy name, END
BEGIN NOW Of Sun! to tell thee how I hate thy beams, END
BEGIN NOW That bring to my remembrance from what state END
BEGIN NOW I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere; END
BEGIN NOW Till pride and worse ambition threw me down END
BEGIN NOW Warring in Heaven against Heaven's matchless King: END
BEGIN NOW Ah, wherefore! he deserved no such return END
BEGIN NOW From me, whom he created what I was END
BEGIN NOW In that bright eminence, and with his good END
BEGIN NOW Upbraided none; nor was his service hard. END
BEGIN NOW What could be less than to afford him praise, END
BEGIN NOW The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks, END
BEGIN NOW How due! yet all his good proved ill in me, END
BEGIN NOW And wrought but malice; lifted up so high END
BEGIN NOW I 'sdeined subjection, and thought one step higher END
BEGIN NOW Would set me highest, and in a moment quit END
BEGIN NOW The debt immense of endless gratitude, END
BEGIN NOW So burdensome still paying, still to owe, END
BEGIN NOW Forgetful what from him I still received, END
BEGIN NOW And understood not that a grateful mind END
BEGIN NOW By owing owes not, but still pays, at once END
BEGIN NOW Indebted and discharged; what burden then END
BEGIN NOW O, had his powerful destiny ordained END
BEGIN NOW Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood END
BEGIN NOW Then happy; no unbounded hope had raised END
BEGIN NOW Ambition! Yet why not some other Power END
BEGIN NOW As great might have aspired, and me, though mean, END
BEGIN NOW Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great END
BEGIN NOW Fell not, but stand unshaken, from within END
BEGIN NOW Or from without, to all temptations armed. END
BEGIN NOW Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand? END
BEGIN NOW Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse, END
BEGIN NOW But Heaven's free love dealt equally to all? END
BEGIN NOW Be then his love accursed, since love or hate, END
BEGIN NOW To me alike, it deals eternal woe. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, cursed be thou; since against his thy will END
BEGIN NOW Chose freely what it now so justly rues. END
BEGIN NOW Me miserable! which way shall I fly END
BEGIN NOW Infinite wrath, and infinite despair? END
BEGIN NOW Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell; END
BEGIN NOW And, in the lowest deep, a lower deep END
BEGIN NOW Still threatening to devour me opens wide, END
BEGIN NOW To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW O, then, at last relent: Is there no place END
BEGIN NOW Left for repentance, none for pardon left? END
BEGIN NOW None left but by submission; and that word END
BEGIN NOW Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame END
BEGIN NOW Among the Spirits beneath, whom I seduced END
BEGIN NOW With other promises and other vaunts END
BEGIN NOW Than to submit, boasting I could subdue END
BEGIN NOW The Omnipotent. Ay me! they little know END
BEGIN NOW How dearly I abide that boast so vain, END
BEGIN NOW Under what torments inwardly I groan, END
BEGIN NOW While they adore me on the throne of Hell. END
BEGIN NOW With diadem and scepter high advanced, END
BEGIN NOW The lower still I fall, only supreme END
BEGIN NOW In misery: Such joy ambition finds. END
BEGIN NOW But say I could repent, and could obtain, END
BEGIN NOW By act of grace, my former state; how soon END
BEGIN NOW Would highth recall high thoughts, how soon unsay END
BEGIN NOW What feigned submission swore? Ease would recant END
BEGIN NOW Vows made in pain, as violent and void. END
BEGIN NOW For never can true reconcilement grow, END
BEGIN NOW Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep: END
BEGIN NOW Which would but lead me to a worse relapse END
BEGIN NOW And heavier fall: so should I purchase dear END
BEGIN NOW Short intermission bought with double smart. END
BEGIN NOW This knows my Punisher; therefore as far END
BEGIN NOW From granting he, as I from begging, peace; END
BEGIN NOW All hope excluded thus, behold, instead END
BEGIN NOW Of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight, END
BEGIN NOW Mankind created, and for him this world. END
BEGIN NOW So farewell, hope; and with hope farewell, fear; END
BEGIN NOW Farewell, remorse! all good to me is lost; END
BEGIN NOW Evil, be thou my good; by thee at least END
BEGIN NOW Divided empire with Heaven's King I hold, END
BEGIN NOW By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign; END
BEGIN NOW As Man ere long, and this new world, shall know. END
BEGIN NOW Thus while he spake, each passion dimmed his face END
BEGIN NOW Thrice changed with pale, ire, envy, and despair; END
BEGIN NOW Which marred his borrowed visage, and betrayed END
BEGIN NOW Him counterfeit, if any eye beheld. END
BEGIN NOW For heavenly minds from such distempers foul END
BEGIN NOW Are ever clear. Whereof he soon aware, END
BEGIN NOW Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm, END
BEGIN NOW Artificer of fraud; and was the first END
BEGIN NOW That practised falsehood under saintly show, END
BEGIN NOW Deep malice to conceal, couched with revenge: END
BEGIN NOW Yet not enough had practised to deceive END
BEGIN NOW Uriel once warned; whose eye pursued him down END
BEGIN NOW The way he went, and on the Assyrian mount END
BEGIN NOW Saw him disfigured, more than could befall END
BEGIN NOW Spirit of happy sort; his gestures fierce END
BEGIN NOW He marked and mad demeanour, then alone, END
BEGIN NOW As he supposed, all unobserved, unseen. END
BEGIN NOW So on he fares, and to the border comes END
BEGIN NOW Of Eden, where delicious Paradise, END
BEGIN NOW Now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green, END
BEGIN NOW As with a rural mound, the champaign head END
BEGIN NOW Of a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides END
BEGIN NOW With thicket overgrown, grotesque and wild, END
BEGIN NOW Access denied; and overhead upgrew END
BEGIN NOW Insuperable height of loftiest shade, END
BEGIN NOW Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm, END
BEGIN NOW A sylvan scene, and, as the ranks ascend, END
BEGIN NOW Shade above shade, a woody theatre END
BEGIN NOW Of stateliest view. Yet higher than their tops END
BEGIN NOW The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung; END
BEGIN NOW Which to our general sire gave prospect large END
BEGIN NOW Into his nether empire neighbouring round. END
BEGIN NOW And higher than that wall a circling row END
BEGIN NOW Of goodliest trees, loaden with fairest fruit, END
BEGIN NOW Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue, END
BEGIN NOW Appeared, with gay enamelled colours mixed: END
BEGIN NOW On which the sun more glad impressed his beams END
BEGIN NOW Than in fair evening cloud, or humid bow, END
BEGIN NOW When God hath showered the earth; so lovely seemed END
BEGIN NOW That landskip: And of pure now purer air END
BEGIN NOW Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires END
BEGIN NOW Vernal delight and joy, able to drive END
BEGIN NOW All sadness but despair: Now gentle gales, END
BEGIN NOW Fanning their odoriferous wings, dispense END
BEGIN NOW Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole END
BEGIN NOW Those balmy spoils. As when to them who fail END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past END
BEGIN NOW Mozambick, off at sea north-east winds blow END
BEGIN NOW Sabean odours from the spicy shore END
BEGIN NOW Of Araby the blest; with such delay END
BEGIN NOW Well pleased they slack their course, and many a league END
BEGIN NOW Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles: END
BEGIN NOW So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend, END
BEGIN NOW Who came their bane; though with them better pleased END
BEGIN NOW Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume END
BEGIN NOW That drove him, though enamoured, from the spouse END
BEGIN NOW Of Tobit's son, and with a vengeance sent END
BEGIN NOW Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill END
BEGIN NOW Satan had journeyed on, pensive and slow; END
BEGIN NOW But further way found none, so thick entwined, END
BEGIN NOW As one continued brake, the undergrowth END
BEGIN NOW Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed END
BEGIN NOW All path of man or beast that passed that way. END
BEGIN NOW One gate there only was, and that looked east END
BEGIN NOW On the other side: which when the arch-felon saw, END
BEGIN NOW Due entrance he disdained; and, in contempt, END
BEGIN NOW At one flight bound high over-leaped all bound END
BEGIN NOW Of hill or highest wall, and sheer within END
BEGIN NOW Lights on his feet. As when a prowling wolf, END
BEGIN NOW Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, END
BEGIN NOW Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve END
BEGIN NOW In hurdled cotes amid the field secure, END
BEGIN NOW Leaps o'er the fence with ease into the fold: END
BEGIN NOW Or as a thief, bent to unhoard the cash END
BEGIN NOW Of some rich burgher, whose substantial doors, END
BEGIN NOW Cross-barred and bolted fast, fear no assault, END
BEGIN NOW In at the window climbs, or o'er the tiles: END
BEGIN NOW So clomb this first grand thief into God's fold; END
BEGIN NOW So since into his church lewd hirelings climb. END
BEGIN NOW Thence up he flew, and on the tree of life, END
BEGIN NOW The middle tree and highest there that grew, END
BEGIN NOW Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life END
BEGIN NOW Thereby regained, but sat devising death END
BEGIN NOW To them who lived; nor on the virtue thought END
BEGIN NOW Of that life-giving plant, but only used END
BEGIN NOW For prospect, what well used had been the pledge END
BEGIN NOW Of immortality. So little knows END
BEGIN NOW Any, but God alone, to value right END
BEGIN NOW The good before him, but perverts best things END
BEGIN NOW To worst abuse, or to their meanest use. END
BEGIN NOW Beneath him with new wonder now he views, END
BEGIN NOW To all delight of human sense exposed, END
BEGIN NOW In narrow room, Nature's whole wealth, yea more, END
BEGIN NOW A Heaven on Earth: For blissful Paradise END
BEGIN NOW Of God the garden was, by him in the east END
BEGIN NOW Of Eden planted; Eden stretched her line END
BEGIN NOW From Auran eastward to the royal towers END
BEGIN NOW Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings, END
BEGIN NOW Or where the sons of Eden long before END
BEGIN NOW Dwelt in Telassar: In this pleasant soil END
BEGIN NOW His far more pleasant garden God ordained; END
BEGIN NOW Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow END
BEGIN NOW All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; END
BEGIN NOW And all amid them stood the tree of life, END
BEGIN NOW High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit END
BEGIN NOW Of vegetable gold; and next to life, END
BEGIN NOW Our death, the tree of knowledge, grew fast by, END
BEGIN NOW Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill. END
BEGIN NOW Southward through Eden went a river large, END
BEGIN NOW Nor changed his course, but through the shaggy hill END
BEGIN NOW Passed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown END
BEGIN NOW That mountain as his garden-mould high raised END
BEGIN NOW Upon the rapid current, which, through veins END
BEGIN NOW Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn, END
BEGIN NOW Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill END
BEGIN NOW Watered the garden; thence united fell END
BEGIN NOW Down the steep glade, and met the nether flood, END
BEGIN NOW Which from his darksome passage now appears, END
BEGIN NOW And now, divided into four main streams, END
BEGIN NOW Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm END
BEGIN NOW And country, whereof here needs no account; END
BEGIN NOW But rather to tell how, if Art could tell, END
BEGIN NOW How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks, END
BEGIN NOW Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold, END
BEGIN NOW With mazy errour under pendant shades END
BEGIN NOW Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed END
BEGIN NOW Flowers worthy of Paradise, which not nice Art END
BEGIN NOW In beds and curious knots, but Nature boon END
BEGIN NOW Poured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain, END
BEGIN NOW Both where the morning sun first warmly smote END
BEGIN NOW The open field, and where the unpierced shade END
BEGIN NOW Imbrowned the noontide bowers: Thus was this place END
BEGIN NOW A happy rural seat of various view; END
BEGIN NOW Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm, END
BEGIN NOW Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind, END
BEGIN NOW Hung amiable, Hesperian fables true, END
BEGIN NOW If true, here only, and of delicious taste: END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks END
BEGIN NOW Grazing the tender herb, were interposed, END
BEGIN NOW Or palmy hillock; or the flowery lap END
BEGIN NOW Of some irriguous valley spread her store, END
BEGIN NOW Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose: END
BEGIN NOW Another side, umbrageous grots and caves END
BEGIN NOW Of cool recess, o'er which the mantling vine END
BEGIN NOW Lays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps END
BEGIN NOW Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall END
BEGIN NOW Down the slope hills, dispersed, or in a lake, END
BEGIN NOW That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned END
BEGIN NOW Her crystal mirrour holds, unite their streams. END
BEGIN NOW The birds their quire apply; airs, vernal airs, END
BEGIN NOW Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune END
BEGIN NOW The trembling leaves, while universal Pan, END
BEGIN NOW Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance, END
BEGIN NOW Led on the eternal Spring. Not that fair field END
BEGIN NOW Of Enna, where Proserpine gathering flowers, END
BEGIN NOW Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis END
BEGIN NOW Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain END
BEGIN NOW To seek her through the world; nor that sweet grove END
BEGIN NOW Of Daphne by Orontes, and the inspired END
BEGIN NOW Castalian spring, might with this Paradise END
BEGIN NOW Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian isle END
BEGIN NOW Girt with the river Triton, where old Cham, END
BEGIN NOW Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove, END
BEGIN NOW Hid Amalthea, and her florid son END
BEGIN NOW Young Bacchus, from his stepdame Rhea's eye; END
BEGIN NOW Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard, END
BEGIN NOW Mount Amara, though this by some supposed END
BEGIN NOW True Paradise under the Ethiop line END
BEGIN NOW By Nilus' head, enclosed with shining rock, END
BEGIN NOW A whole day's journey high, but wide remote END
BEGIN NOW From this Assyrian garden, where the Fiend END
BEGIN NOW Saw, undelighted, all delight, all kind END
BEGIN NOW Of living creatures, new to sight, and strange END
BEGIN NOW Two of far nobler shape, erect and tall, END
BEGIN NOW Godlike erect, with native honour clad END
BEGIN NOW In naked majesty seemed lords of all: END
BEGIN NOW And worthy seemed; for in their looks divine END
BEGIN NOW The image of their glorious Maker shone, END
BEGIN NOW Truth, wisdom, sanctitude severe and pure, END
BEGIN NOW (Severe, but in true filial freedom placed,) END
BEGIN NOW Whence true authority in men; though both END
BEGIN NOW Not equal, as their sex not equal seemed; END
BEGIN NOW For contemplation he and valour formed; END
BEGIN NOW For softness she and sweet attractive grace; END
BEGIN NOW He for God only, she for God in him: END
BEGIN NOW His fair large front and eye sublime declared END
BEGIN NOW Absolute rule; and hyacinthine locks END
BEGIN NOW Round from his parted forelock manly hung END
BEGIN NOW Clustering, but not beneath his shoulders broad: END
BEGIN NOW She, as a veil, down to the slender waist END
BEGIN NOW Her unadorned golden tresses wore END
BEGIN NOW Dishevelled, but in wanton ringlets waved END
BEGIN NOW As the vine curls her tendrils, which implied END
BEGIN NOW Subjection, but required with gentle sway, END
BEGIN NOW And by her yielded, by him best received, END
BEGIN NOW Yielded with coy submission, modest pride, END
BEGIN NOW And sweet, reluctant, amorous delay. END
BEGIN NOW Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed; END
BEGIN NOW Then was not guilty shame, dishonest shame END
BEGIN NOW Of nature's works, honour dishonourable, END
BEGIN NOW Sin-bred, how have ye troubled all mankind END
BEGIN NOW With shows instead, mere shows of seeming pure, END
BEGIN NOW And banished from man's life his happiest life, END
BEGIN NOW Simplicity and spotless innocence! END
BEGIN NOW So passed they naked on, nor shunned the sight END
BEGIN NOW Of God or Angel; for they thought no ill: END
BEGIN NOW So hand in hand they passed, the loveliest pair, END
BEGIN NOW That ever since in love's embraces met; END
BEGIN NOW Adam the goodliest man of men since born END
BEGIN NOW His sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve. END
BEGIN NOW Under a tuft of shade that on a green END
BEGIN NOW Stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain side END
BEGIN NOW They sat them down; and, after no more toil END
BEGIN NOW Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed END
BEGIN NOW To recommend cool Zephyr, and made ease END
BEGIN NOW More easy, wholesome thirst and appetite END
BEGIN NOW More grateful, to their supper-fruits they fell, END
BEGIN NOW Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs END
BEGIN NOW Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline END
BEGIN NOW On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers: END
BEGIN NOW The savoury pulp they chew, and in the rind, END
BEGIN NOW Still as they thirsted, scoop the brimming stream; END
BEGIN NOW Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles END
BEGIN NOW Wanted, nor youthful dalliance, as beseems END
BEGIN NOW Fair couple, linked in happy nuptial league, END
BEGIN NOW Alone as they. About them frisking played END
BEGIN NOW All beasts of the earth, since wild, and of all chase END
BEGIN NOW In wood or wilderness, forest or den; END
BEGIN NOW Sporting the lion ramped, and in his paw END
BEGIN NOW Dandled the kid; bears, tigers, ounces, pards, END
BEGIN NOW Gambolled before them; the unwieldy elephant, END
BEGIN NOW To make them mirth, used all his might, and wreathed END
BEGIN NOW His lithe proboscis; close the serpent sly, END
BEGIN NOW Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine END
BEGIN NOW His braided train, and of his fatal guile END
BEGIN NOW Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass END
BEGIN NOW Couched, and now filled with pasture gazing sat, END
BEGIN NOW Or bedward ruminating; for the sun, END
BEGIN NOW Declined, was hasting now with prone career END
BEGIN NOW To the ocean isles, and in the ascending scale END
BEGIN NOW Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose: END
BEGIN NOW When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood, END
BEGIN NOW Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad. END
BEGIN NOW O Hell! what do mine eyes with grief behold! END
BEGIN NOW Into our room of bliss thus high advanced END
BEGIN NOW Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, END
BEGIN NOW Not Spirits, yet to heavenly Spirits bright END
BEGIN NOW Little inferiour; whom my thoughts pursue END
BEGIN NOW With wonder, and could love, so lively shines END
BEGIN NOW In them divine resemblance, and such grace END
BEGIN NOW The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! gentle pair, ye little think how nigh END
BEGIN NOW Your change approaches, when all these delights END
BEGIN NOW Will vanish, and deliver ye to woe; END
BEGIN NOW More woe, the more your taste is now of joy; END
BEGIN NOW Happy, but for so happy ill secured END
BEGIN NOW Long to continue, and this high seat your Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe END
BEGIN NOW As now is entered; yet no purposed foe END
BEGIN NOW To you, whom I could pity thus forlorn, END
BEGIN NOW Though I unpitied: League with you I seek, END
BEGIN NOW And mutual amity, so strait, so close, END
BEGIN NOW That I with you must dwell, or you with me END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please, END
BEGIN NOW Like this fair Paradise, your sense; yet such END
BEGIN NOW Accept your Maker's work; he gave it me, END
BEGIN NOW Which I as freely give: Hell shall unfold, END
BEGIN NOW To entertain you two, her widest gates, END
BEGIN NOW And send forth all her kings; there will be room, END
BEGIN NOW Not like these narrow limits, to receive END
BEGIN NOW Your numerous offspring; if no better place, END
BEGIN NOW Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge END
BEGIN NOW On you who wrong me not for him who wronged. END
BEGIN NOW And should I at your harmless innocence END
BEGIN NOW Melt, as I do, yet publick reason just, END
BEGIN NOW Honour and empire with revenge enlarged, END
BEGIN NOW By conquering this new world, compels me now END
BEGIN NOW To do what else, though damned, I should abhor. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Fiend, and with necessity, END
BEGIN NOW The tyrant's plea, excused his devilish deeds. END
BEGIN NOW Then from his lofty stand on that high tree END
BEGIN NOW Down he alights among the sportful herd END
BEGIN NOW Of those four-footed kinds, himself now one, END
BEGIN NOW Now other, as their shape served best his end END
BEGIN NOW Nearer to view his prey, and, unespied, END
BEGIN NOW To mark what of their state he more might learn, END
BEGIN NOW By word or action marked. About them round END
BEGIN NOW A lion now he stalks with fiery glare; END
BEGIN NOW Then as a tiger, who by chance hath spied END
BEGIN NOW In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play, END
BEGIN NOW Straight couches close, then, rising, changes oft END
BEGIN NOW His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground, END
BEGIN NOW Whence rushing, he might surest seize them both, END
BEGIN NOW Griped in each paw: when, Adam first of men END
BEGIN NOW To first of women Eve thus moving speech, END
BEGIN NOW Turned him, all ear to hear new utterance flow. END
BEGIN NOW Sole partner, and sole part, of all these joys, END
BEGIN NOW Dearer thyself than all; needs must the Power END
BEGIN NOW That made us, and for us this ample world, END
BEGIN NOW Be infinitely good, and of his good END
BEGIN NOW As liberal and free as infinite; END
BEGIN NOW That raised us from the dust, and placed us here END
BEGIN NOW In all this happiness, who at his hand END
BEGIN NOW Have nothing merited, nor can perform END
BEGIN NOW Aught whereof he hath need; he who requires END
BEGIN NOW From us no other service than to keep END
BEGIN NOW This one, this easy charge, of all the trees END
BEGIN NOW In Paradise that bear delicious fruit END
BEGIN NOW So various, not to taste that only tree END
BEGIN NOW Of knowledge, planted by the tree of life; END
BEGIN NOW So near grows death to life, whate'er death is, END
BEGIN NOW Some dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowest END
BEGIN NOW God hath pronounced it death to taste that tree, END
BEGIN NOW The only sign of our obedience left, END
BEGIN NOW Among so many signs of power and rule END
BEGIN NOW Conferred upon us, and dominion given END
BEGIN NOW Over all other creatures that possess END
BEGIN NOW Earth, air, and sea. Then let us not think hard END
BEGIN NOW One easy prohibition, who enjoy END
BEGIN NOW Free leave so large to all things else, and choice END
BEGIN NOW Unlimited of manifold delights: END
BEGIN NOW But let us ever praise him, and extol END
BEGIN NOW His bounty, following our delightful task, END
BEGIN NOW To prune these growing plants, and tend these flowers, END
BEGIN NOW Which were it toilsome, yet with thee were sweet. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Eve replied. O thou for whom END
BEGIN NOW And from whom I was formed, flesh of thy flesh, END
BEGIN NOW And without whom am to no end, my guide END
BEGIN NOW And head! what thou hast said is just and right. END
BEGIN NOW For we to him indeed all praises owe, END
BEGIN NOW And daily thanks; I chiefly, who enjoy END
BEGIN NOW So far the happier lot, enjoying thee END
BEGIN NOW Pre-eminent by so much odds, while thou END
BEGIN NOW Like consort to thyself canst no where find. END
BEGIN NOW That day I oft remember, when from sleep END
BEGIN NOW I first awaked, and found myself reposed END
BEGIN NOW Under a shade on flowers, much wondering where END
BEGIN NOW And what I was, whence thither brought, and how. END
BEGIN NOW Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound END
BEGIN NOW Of waters issued from a cave, and spread END
BEGIN NOW Into a liquid plain, then stood unmoved END
BEGIN NOW Pure as the expanse of Heaven; I thither went END
BEGIN NOW With unexperienced thought, and laid me down END
BEGIN NOW On the green bank, to look into the clear END
BEGIN NOW Smooth lake, that to me seemed another sky. END
BEGIN NOW As I bent down to look, just opposite END
BEGIN NOW A shape within the watery gleam appeared, END
BEGIN NOW Bending to look on me: I started back, END
BEGIN NOW It started back; but pleased I soon returned, END
BEGIN NOW Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks END
BEGIN NOW Of sympathy and love: There I had fixed END
BEGIN NOW Mine eyes till now, and pined with vain desire, END
BEGIN NOW Had not a voice thus warned me; "What thou seest, END
BEGIN NOW What there thou seest, fair Creature, is thyself; END
BEGIN NOW With thee it came and goes: but follow me, END
BEGIN NOW And I will bring thee where no shadow stays END
BEGIN NOW Thy coming, and thy soft embraces, he END
BEGIN NOW Whose image thou art; him thou shalt enjoy END
BEGIN NOW Inseparably thine, to him shalt bear END
BEGIN NOW Multitudes like thyself, and thence be called END
BEGIN NOW Mother of human race." What could I do, END
BEGIN NOW But follow straight, invisibly thus led? END
BEGIN NOW Till I espied thee, fair indeed and tall, END
BEGIN NOW Under a platane; yet methought less fair, END
BEGIN NOW Less winning soft, less amiably mild, END
BEGIN NOW Than that smooth watery image: Back I turned; END
BEGIN NOW Thou following cryedst aloud, "Return, fair Eve; END
BEGIN NOW Whom flyest thou? whom thou flyest, of him thou art, END
BEGIN NOW His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent END
BEGIN NOW Out of my side to thee, nearest my heart, END
BEGIN NOW Substantial life, to have thee by my side END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth an individual solace dear; END
BEGIN NOW Part of my soul I seek thee, and thee claim END
BEGIN NOW My other half:" With that thy gentle hand END
BEGIN NOW Seised mine: I yielded; and from that time see END
BEGIN NOW How beauty is excelled by manly grace, END
BEGIN NOW And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. END
BEGIN NOW So spake our general mother, and with eyes END
BEGIN NOW Of conjugal attraction unreproved, END
BEGIN NOW And meek surrender, half-embracing leaned END
BEGIN NOW On our first father; half her swelling breast END
BEGIN NOW Naked met his, under the flowing gold END
BEGIN NOW Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight END
BEGIN NOW Both of her beauty, and submissive charms, END
BEGIN NOW Smiled with superiour love, as Jupiter END
BEGIN NOW On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds END
BEGIN NOW That shed Mayflowers; and pressed her matron lip END
BEGIN NOW With kisses pure: Aside the Devil turned END
BEGIN NOW For envy; yet with jealous leer malign END
BEGIN NOW Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plained. END
BEGIN NOW Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two, END
BEGIN NOW Imparadised in one another's arms, END
BEGIN NOW The happier Eden, shall enjoy their fill END
BEGIN NOW Of bliss on bliss; while I to Hell am thrust, END
BEGIN NOW Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, END
BEGIN NOW Among our other torments not the least, END
BEGIN NOW Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines. END
BEGIN NOW Yet let me not forget what I have gained END
BEGIN NOW From their own mouths: All is not theirs, it seems; END
BEGIN NOW One fatal tree there stands, of knowledge called, END
BEGIN NOW Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidden END
BEGIN NOW Suspicious, reasonless. Why should their Lord END
BEGIN NOW Envy them that? Can it be sin to know? END
BEGIN NOW Can it be death? And do they only stand END
BEGIN NOW By ignorance? Is that their happy state, END
BEGIN NOW The proof of their obedience and their faith? END
BEGIN NOW O fair foundation laid whereon to build END
BEGIN NOW Their ruin! hence I will excite their minds END
BEGIN NOW With more desire to know, and to reject END
BEGIN NOW Envious commands, invented with design END
BEGIN NOW To keep them low, whom knowledge might exalt END
BEGIN NOW Equal with Gods: aspiring to be such, END
BEGIN NOW They taste and die: What likelier can ensue END
BEGIN NOW But first with narrow search I must walk round END
BEGIN NOW This garden, and no corner leave unspied; END
BEGIN NOW A chance but chance may lead where I may meet END
BEGIN NOW Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side, END
BEGIN NOW Or in thick shade retired, from him to draw END
BEGIN NOW What further would be learned. Live while ye may, END
BEGIN NOW Yet happy pair; enjoy, till I return, END
BEGIN NOW Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed! END
BEGIN NOW So saying, his proud step he scornful turned, END
BEGIN NOW But with sly circumspection, and began END
BEGIN NOW Through wood, through waste, o'er hill, o'er dale, his roam END
BEGIN NOW Mean while in utmost longitude, where Heaven END
BEGIN NOW With earth and ocean meets, the setting sun END
BEGIN NOW Slowly descended, and with right aspect END
BEGIN NOW Against the eastern gate of Paradise END
BEGIN NOW Levelled his evening rays: It was a rock END
BEGIN NOW Of alabaster, piled up to the clouds, END
BEGIN NOW Conspicuous far, winding with one ascent END
BEGIN NOW Accessible from earth, one entrance high; END
BEGIN NOW The rest was craggy cliff, that overhung END
BEGIN NOW Still as it rose, impossible to climb. END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat, END
BEGIN NOW Chief of the angelick guards, awaiting night; END
BEGIN NOW About him exercised heroick games END
BEGIN NOW The unarmed youth of Heaven, but nigh at hand END
BEGIN NOW Celestial armoury, shields, helms, and spears, END
BEGIN NOW Hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold. END
BEGIN NOW Thither came Uriel, gliding through the even END
BEGIN NOW On a sun-beam, swift as a shooting star END
BEGIN NOW In autumn thwarts the night, when vapours fired END
BEGIN NOW Impress the air, and shows the mariner END
BEGIN NOW From what point of his compass to beware END
BEGIN NOW Impetuous winds: He thus began in haste. END
BEGIN NOW Gabriel, to thee thy course by lot hath given END
BEGIN NOW Charge and strict watch, that to this happy place END
BEGIN NOW No evil thing approach or enter in. END
BEGIN NOW This day at highth of noon came to my sphere END
BEGIN NOW A Spirit, zealous, as he seemed, to know END
BEGIN NOW More of the Almighty's works, and chiefly Man, END
BEGIN NOW God's latest image: I described his way END
BEGIN NOW Bent all on speed, and marked his aery gait; END
BEGIN NOW But in the mount that lies from Eden north, END
BEGIN NOW Where he first lighted, soon discerned his looks END
BEGIN NOW Alien from Heaven, with passions foul obscured: END
BEGIN NOW Mine eye pursued him still, but under shade END
BEGIN NOW Lost sight of him: One of the banished crew, END
BEGIN NOW I fear, hath ventured from the deep, to raise END
BEGIN NOW New troubles; him thy care must be to find. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the winged warriour thus returned. END
BEGIN NOW Uriel, no wonder if thy perfect sight, END
BEGIN NOW Amid the sun's bright circle where thou sitst, END
BEGIN NOW See far and wide: In at this gate none pass END
BEGIN NOW The vigilance here placed, but such as come END
BEGIN NOW Well known from Heaven; and since meridian hour END
BEGIN NOW No creature thence: If Spirit of other sort, END
BEGIN NOW So minded, have o'er-leaped these earthly bounds END
BEGIN NOW On purpose, hard thou knowest it to exclude END
BEGIN NOW Spiritual substance with corporeal bar. END
BEGIN NOW But if within the circuit of these walks, END
BEGIN NOW In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom END
BEGIN NOW Thou tellest, by morrow dawning I shall know. END
BEGIN NOW So promised he; and Uriel to his charge END
BEGIN NOW Returned on that bright beam, whose point now raised END
BEGIN NOW Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen END
BEGIN NOW Beneath the Azores; whether the prime orb, END
BEGIN NOW Incredible how swift, had thither rolled END
BEGIN NOW Diurnal, or this less volubil earth, END
BEGIN NOW By shorter flight to the east, had left him there END
BEGIN NOW Arraying with reflected purple and gold END
BEGIN NOW The clouds that on his western throne attend. END
BEGIN NOW Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray END
BEGIN NOW Had in her sober livery all things clad; END
BEGIN NOW Silence accompanied; for beast and bird, END
BEGIN NOW They to their grassy couch, these to their nests END
BEGIN NOW Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale; END
BEGIN NOW She all night long her amorous descant sung; END
BEGIN NOW Silence was pleased: Now glowed the firmament END
BEGIN NOW With living sapphires: Hesperus, that led END
BEGIN NOW The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon, END
BEGIN NOW Rising in clouded majesty, at length END
BEGIN NOW Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light, END
BEGIN NOW And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw. END
BEGIN NOW When Adam thus to Eve. Fair Consort, the hour END
BEGIN NOW Of night, and all things now retired to rest, END
BEGIN NOW Mind us of like repose; since God hath set END
BEGIN NOW Labour and rest, as day and night, to men END
BEGIN NOW Successive; and the timely dew of sleep, END
BEGIN NOW Now falling with soft slumbrous weight, inclines END
BEGIN NOW Our eye-lids: Other creatures all day long END
BEGIN NOW Rove idle, unemployed, and less need rest; END
BEGIN NOW Man hath his daily work of body or mind END
BEGIN NOW Appointed, which declares his dignity, END
BEGIN NOW And the regard of Heaven on all his ways; END
BEGIN NOW While other animals unactive range, END
BEGIN NOW And of their doings God takes no account. END
BEGIN NOW To-morrow, ere fresh morning streak the east END
BEGIN NOW With first approach of light, we must be risen, END
BEGIN NOW And at our pleasant labour, to reform END
BEGIN NOW Yon flowery arbours, yonder alleys green, END
BEGIN NOW Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown, END
BEGIN NOW That mock our scant manuring, and require END
BEGIN NOW More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth: END
BEGIN NOW Those blossoms also, and those dropping gums, END
BEGIN NOW That lie bestrown, unsightly and unsmooth, END
BEGIN NOW Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; END
BEGIN NOW Mean while, as Nature wills, night bids us rest. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Eve, with perfect beauty adorned END
BEGIN NOW My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst END
BEGIN NOW Unargued I obey: So God ordains; END
BEGIN NOW God is thy law, thou mine: To know no more END
BEGIN NOW Is woman's happiest knowledge, and her praise. END
BEGIN NOW With thee conversing I forget all time; END
BEGIN NOW All seasons, and their change, all please alike. END
BEGIN NOW Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet, END
BEGIN NOW With charm of earliest birds: pleasant the sun, END
BEGIN NOW When first on this delightful land he spreads END
BEGIN NOW His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower, END
BEGIN NOW Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile earth END
BEGIN NOW After soft showers; and sweet the coming on END
BEGIN NOW Of grateful Evening mild; then silent Night, END
BEGIN NOW With this her solemn bird, and this fair moon, END
BEGIN NOW And these the gems of Heaven, her starry train: END
BEGIN NOW But neither breath of Morn, when she ascends END
BEGIN NOW With charm of earliest birds; nor rising sun END
BEGIN NOW On this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flower, END
BEGIN NOW Glistering with dew; nor fragrance after showers; END
BEGIN NOW Nor grateful Evening mild; nor silent Night, END
BEGIN NOW With this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon, END
BEGIN NOW Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet. END
BEGIN NOW But wherefore all night long shine these? for whom END
BEGIN NOW This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes? END
BEGIN NOW To whom our general ancestor replied. END
BEGIN NOW Daughter of God and Man, accomplished Eve, END
BEGIN NOW These have their course to finish round the earth, END
BEGIN NOW By morrow evening, and from land to land END
BEGIN NOW In order, though to nations yet unborn, END
BEGIN NOW Ministring light prepared, they set and rise; END
BEGIN NOW Lest total Darkness should by night regain END
BEGIN NOW Her old possession, and extinguish life END
BEGIN NOW In Nature and all things; which these soft fires END
BEGIN NOW Not only enlighten, but with kindly heat END
BEGIN NOW Of various influence foment and warm, END
BEGIN NOW Temper or nourish, or in part shed down END
BEGIN NOW Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow END
BEGIN NOW On earth, made hereby apter to receive END
BEGIN NOW Perfection from the sun's more potent ray. END
BEGIN NOW These then, though unbeheld in deep of night, END
BEGIN NOW Shine not in vain; nor think, though men were none, END
BEGIN NOW That Heaven would want spectators, God want praise: END
BEGIN NOW Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth END
BEGIN NOW Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep: END
BEGIN NOW All these with ceaseless praise his works behold END
BEGIN NOW Both day and night: How often from the steep END
BEGIN NOW Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard END
BEGIN NOW Celestial voices to the midnight air, END
BEGIN NOW Sole, or responsive each to others note, END
BEGIN NOW Singing their great Creator? oft in bands END
BEGIN NOW While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk, END
BEGIN NOW With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds END
BEGIN NOW In full harmonick number joined, their songs END
BEGIN NOW Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Thus talking, hand in hand alone they passed END
BEGIN NOW On to their blissful bower: it was a place END
BEGIN NOW Chosen by the sovran Planter, when he framed END
BEGIN NOW All things to Man's delightful use; the roof END
BEGIN NOW Of thickest covert was inwoven shade END
BEGIN NOW Laurel and myrtle, and what higher grew END
BEGIN NOW Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side END
BEGIN NOW Acanthus, and each odorous bushy shrub, END
BEGIN NOW Fenced up the verdant wall; each beauteous flower, END
BEGIN NOW Iris all hues, roses, and jessamin, END
BEGIN NOW Reared high their flourished heads between, and wrought END
BEGIN NOW Mosaick; underfoot the violet, END
BEGIN NOW Crocus, and hyacinth, with rich inlay END
BEGIN NOW Broidered the ground, more coloured than with stone END
BEGIN NOW Of costliest emblem: Other creature here, END
BEGIN NOW Bird, beast, insect, or worm, durst enter none, END
BEGIN NOW Such was their awe of Man. In shadier bower END
BEGIN NOW More sacred and sequestered, though but feigned, END
BEGIN NOW Pan or Sylvanus never slept, nor Nymph END
BEGIN NOW Nor Faunus haunted. Here, in close recess, END
BEGIN NOW With flowers, garlands, and sweet-smelling herbs, END
BEGIN NOW Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed; END
BEGIN NOW And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung, END
BEGIN NOW What day the genial Angel to our sire END
BEGIN NOW Brought her in naked beauty more adorned, END
BEGIN NOW More lovely, than Pandora, whom the Gods END
BEGIN NOW Endowed with all their gifts, and O! too like END
BEGIN NOW In sad event, when to the unwiser son END
BEGIN NOW Mankind with her fair looks, to be avenged END
BEGIN NOW On him who had stole Jove's authentick fire. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, at their shady lodge arrived, both stood, END
BEGIN NOW Both turned, and under open sky adored END
BEGIN NOW The God that made both sky, air, earth, and heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Which they beheld, the moon's resplendent globe, END
BEGIN NOW And starry pole: Thou also madest the night, END
BEGIN NOW Maker Omnipotent, and thou the day, END
BEGIN NOW Which we, in our appointed work employed, END
BEGIN NOW Have finished, happy in our mutual help END
BEGIN NOW And mutual love, the crown of all our bliss END
BEGIN NOW Ordained by thee; and this delicious place END
BEGIN NOW For us too large, where thy abundance wants END
BEGIN NOW Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. END
BEGIN NOW But thou hast promised from us two a race END
BEGIN NOW To fill the earth, who shall with us extol END
BEGIN NOW Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake, END
BEGIN NOW And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. END
BEGIN NOW This said unanimous, and other rites END
BEGIN NOW Observing none, but adoration pure END
BEGIN NOW Which God likes best, into their inmost bower END
BEGIN NOW Handed they went; and, eased the putting off END
BEGIN NOW These troublesome disguises which we wear, END
BEGIN NOW Straight side by side were laid; nor turned, I ween, END
BEGIN NOW Adam from his fair spouse, nor Eve the rites END
BEGIN NOW Mysterious of connubial love refused: END
BEGIN NOW Whatever hypocrites austerely talk END
BEGIN NOW Of purity, and place, and innocence, END
BEGIN NOW Defaming as impure what God declares END
BEGIN NOW Pure, and commands to some, leaves free to all. END
BEGIN NOW Our Maker bids encrease; who bids abstain END
BEGIN NOW Hail, wedded Love, mysterious law, true source END
BEGIN NOW Of human offspring, sole propriety END
BEGIN NOW In Paradise of all things common else! END
BEGIN NOW By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men END
BEGIN NOW Among the bestial herds to range; by thee END
BEGIN NOW Founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure, END
BEGIN NOW Relations dear, and all the charities END
BEGIN NOW Of father, son, and brother, first were known. END
BEGIN NOW Far be it, that I should write thee sin or blame, END
BEGIN NOW Or think thee unbefitting holiest place, END
BEGIN NOW Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets, END
BEGIN NOW Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced, END
BEGIN NOW Present, or past, as saints and patriarchs used. END
BEGIN NOW Here Love his golden shafts employs, here lights END
BEGIN NOW His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings, END
BEGIN NOW Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile END
BEGIN NOW Of harlots, loveless, joyless, unendeared, END
BEGIN NOW Casual fruition; nor in court-amours, END
BEGIN NOW Mixed dance, or wanton mask, or midnight ball, END
BEGIN NOW Or serenate, which the starved lover sings END
BEGIN NOW To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. END
BEGIN NOW These, lulled by nightingales, embracing slept, END
BEGIN NOW And on their naked limbs the flowery roof END
BEGIN NOW Showered roses, which the morn repaired. Sleep on, END
BEGIN NOW Blest pair; and O! yet happiest, if ye seek END
BEGIN NOW No happier state, and know to know no more. END
BEGIN NOW Now had night measured with her shadowy cone END
BEGIN NOW Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault, END
BEGIN NOW And from their ivory port the Cherubim, END
BEGIN NOW Forth issuing at the accustomed hour, stood armed END
BEGIN NOW To their night watches in warlike parade; END
BEGIN NOW When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake. END
BEGIN NOW Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the south END
BEGIN NOW With strictest watch; these other wheel the north; END
BEGIN NOW Our circuit meets full west. As flame they part, END
BEGIN NOW Half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear. END
BEGIN NOW From these, two strong and subtle Spirits he called END
BEGIN NOW That near him stood, and gave them thus in charge. END
BEGIN NOW Ithuriel and Zephon, with winged speed END
BEGIN NOW Search through this garden, leave unsearched no nook; END
BEGIN NOW But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge, END
BEGIN NOW Now laid perhaps asleep, secure of harm. END
BEGIN NOW This evening from the sun's decline arrived, END
BEGIN NOW Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen END
BEGIN NOW Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escaped END
BEGIN NOW The bars of Hell, on errand bad no doubt: END
BEGIN NOW Such, where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. END
BEGIN NOW So saying, on he led his radiant files, END
BEGIN NOW Dazzling the moon; these to the bower direct END
BEGIN NOW In search of whom they sought: Him there they found END
BEGIN NOW Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve, END
BEGIN NOW Assaying by his devilish art to reach END
BEGIN NOW The organs of her fancy, and with them forge END
BEGIN NOW Illusions, as he list, phantasms and dreams; END
BEGIN NOW Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint END
BEGIN NOW The animal spirits, that from pure blood arise END
BEGIN NOW Like gentle breaths from rivers pure, thence raise END
BEGIN NOW At least distempered, discontented thoughts, END
BEGIN NOW Vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate desires, END
BEGIN NOW Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride. END
BEGIN NOW Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear END
BEGIN NOW Touched lightly; for no falshood can endure END
BEGIN NOW Touch of celestial temper, but returns END
BEGIN NOW Of force to its own likeness: Up he starts END
BEGIN NOW Discovered and surprised. As when a spark END
BEGIN NOW Lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid END
BEGIN NOW Fit for the tun some magazine to store END
BEGIN NOW Against a rumoured war, the smutty grain, END
BEGIN NOW With sudden blaze diffused, inflames the air; END
BEGIN NOW So started up in his own shape the Fiend. END
BEGIN NOW Back stept those two fair Angels, half amazed END
BEGIN NOW So sudden to behold the grisly king; END
BEGIN NOW Yet thus, unmoved with fear, accost him soon. END
BEGIN NOW Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell END
BEGIN NOW Comest thou, escaped thy prison? and, transformed, END
BEGIN NOW Why sat'st thou like an enemy in wait, END
BEGIN NOW Here watching at the head of these that sleep? END
BEGIN NOW Know ye not then said Satan, filled with scorn, END
BEGIN NOW Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate END
BEGIN NOW For you, there sitting where ye durst not soar: END
BEGIN NOW Not to know me argues yourselves unknown, END
BEGIN NOW The lowest of your throng; or, if ye know, END
BEGIN NOW Why ask ye, and superfluous begin END
BEGIN NOW Your message, like to end as much in vain? END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn. END
BEGIN NOW Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, END
BEGIN NOW Or undiminished brightness to be known, END
BEGIN NOW As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure; END
BEGIN NOW That glory then, when thou no more wast good, END
BEGIN NOW Departed from thee; and thou resemblest now END
BEGIN NOW Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul. END
BEGIN NOW But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account END
BEGIN NOW To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep END
BEGIN NOW This place inviolable, and these from harm. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Cherub; and his grave rebuke, END
BEGIN NOW Severe in youthful beauty, added grace END
BEGIN NOW Invincible: Abashed the Devil stood, END
BEGIN NOW And felt how awful goodness is, and saw END
BEGIN NOW Virtue in her shape how lovely; saw, and pined END
BEGIN NOW His loss; but chiefly to find here observed END
BEGIN NOW His lustre visibly impaired; yet seemed END
BEGIN NOW Undaunted. If I must contend, said he, END
BEGIN NOW Best with the best, the sender, not the sent, END
BEGIN NOW Or all at once; more glory will be won, END
BEGIN NOW Or less be lost. Thy fear, said Zephon bold, END
BEGIN NOW Will save us trial what the least can do END
BEGIN NOW Single against thee wicked, and thence weak. END
BEGIN NOW The Fiend replied not, overcome with rage; END
BEGIN NOW But, like a proud steed reined, went haughty on, END
BEGIN NOW Champing his iron curb: To strive or fly END
BEGIN NOW He held it vain; awe from above had quelled END
BEGIN NOW His heart, not else dismayed. Now drew they nigh END
BEGIN NOW The western point, where those half-rounding guards END
BEGIN NOW Just met, and closing stood in squadron joined, END
BEGIN NOW A waiting next command. To whom their Chief, END
BEGIN NOW Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud. END
BEGIN NOW O friends! I hear the tread of nimble feet END
BEGIN NOW Hasting this way, and now by glimpse discern END
BEGIN NOW Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade; END
BEGIN NOW And with them comes a third of regal port, END
BEGIN NOW But faded splendour wan; who by his gait END
BEGIN NOW And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell, END
BEGIN NOW Not likely to part hence without contest; END
BEGIN NOW Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. END
BEGIN NOW He scarce had ended, when those two approached, END
BEGIN NOW And brief related whom they brought, where found, END
BEGIN NOW How busied, in what form and posture couched. END
BEGIN NOW To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. END
BEGIN NOW Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescribed END
BEGIN NOW To thy transgressions, and disturbed the charge END
BEGIN NOW Of others, who approve not to transgress END
BEGIN NOW By thy example, but have power and right END
BEGIN NOW To question thy bold entrance on this place; END
BEGIN NOW Employed, it seems, to violate sleep, and those END
BEGIN NOW Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss! END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow. END
BEGIN NOW Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise, END
BEGIN NOW And such I held thee; but this question asked END
BEGIN NOW Puts me in doubt. Lives there who loves his pain! END
BEGIN NOW Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, END
BEGIN NOW Though thither doomed! Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt END
BEGIN NOW And boldly venture to whatever place END
BEGIN NOW Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change END
BEGIN NOW Torment with ease, and soonest recompense END
BEGIN NOW Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; END
BEGIN NOW To thee no reason, who knowest only good, END
BEGIN NOW But evil hast not tried: and wilt object END
BEGIN NOW His will who bounds us! Let him surer bar END
BEGIN NOW His iron gates, if he intends our stay END
BEGIN NOW In that dark durance: Thus much what was asked. END
BEGIN NOW The rest is true, they found me where they say; END
BEGIN NOW But that implies not violence or harm. END
BEGIN NOW Thus he in scorn. The warlike Angel moved, END
BEGIN NOW Disdainfully half smiling, thus replied. END
BEGIN NOW O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise END
BEGIN NOW Since Satan fell, whom folly overthrew, END
BEGIN NOW And now returns him from his prison 'scaped, END
BEGIN NOW Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise END
BEGIN NOW Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither END
BEGIN NOW Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed; END
BEGIN NOW So wise he judges it to fly from pain END
BEGIN NOW However, and to 'scape his punishment! END
BEGIN NOW So judge thou still, presumptuous! till the wrath, END
BEGIN NOW Which thou incurrest by flying, meet thy flight END
BEGIN NOW Sevenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, END
BEGIN NOW Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain END
BEGIN NOW Can equal anger infinite provoked. END
BEGIN NOW But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee END
BEGIN NOW Came not all hell broke loose? or thou than they END
BEGIN NOW Less hardy to endure? Courageous Chief! END
BEGIN NOW The first in flight from pain! hadst thou alleged END
BEGIN NOW To thy deserted host this cause of flight, END
BEGIN NOW Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. END
BEGIN NOW To which the Fiend thus answered, frowning stern. END
BEGIN NOW Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain, END
BEGIN NOW Insulting Angel! well thou knowest I stood END
BEGIN NOW Thy fiercest, when in battle to thy aid END
BEGIN NOW The blasting vollied thunder made all speed, END
BEGIN NOW And seconded thy else not dreaded spear. END
BEGIN NOW But still thy words at random, as before, END
BEGIN NOW Argue thy inexperience what behoves END
BEGIN NOW From hard assays and ill successes past END
BEGIN NOW A faithful leader, not to hazard all END
BEGIN NOW Through ways of danger by himself untried: END
BEGIN NOW I, therefore, I alone first undertook END
BEGIN NOW To wing the desolate abyss, and spy END
BEGIN NOW This new created world, whereof in Hell END
BEGIN NOW Fame is not silent, here in hope to find END
BEGIN NOW Better abode, and my afflicted Powers END
BEGIN NOW To settle here on earth, or in mid air; END
BEGIN NOW Though for possession put to try once more END
BEGIN NOW What thou and thy gay legions dare against; END
BEGIN NOW Whose easier business were to serve their Lord END
BEGIN NOW High up in Heaven, with songs to hymn his throne, END
BEGIN NOW And practised distances to cringe, not fight, END
BEGIN NOW To whom the warriour Angel soon replied. END
BEGIN NOW To say and straight unsay, pretending first END
BEGIN NOW Wise to fly pain, professing next the spy, END
BEGIN NOW Argues no leader but a liar traced, END
BEGIN NOW Satan, and couldst thou faithful add? O name, END
BEGIN NOW O sacred name of faithfulness profaned! END
BEGIN NOW Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? END
BEGIN NOW Army of Fiends, fit body to fit head. END
BEGIN NOW Was this your discipline and faith engaged, END
BEGIN NOW Your military obedience, to dissolve END
BEGIN NOW Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme? END
BEGIN NOW And thou, sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem END
BEGIN NOW Patron of liberty, who more than thou END
BEGIN NOW Once fawned, and cringed, and servilely adored END
BEGIN NOW Heaven's awful Monarch? wherefore, but in hope END
BEGIN NOW To dispossess him, and thyself to reign? END
BEGIN NOW But mark what I arreed thee now, Avant; END
BEGIN NOW Fly neither whence thou fledst! If from this hour END
BEGIN NOW Within these hallowed limits thou appear, END
BEGIN NOW Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained, END
BEGIN NOW And seal thee so, as henceforth not to scorn END
BEGIN NOW The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred. END
BEGIN NOW So threatened he; but Satan to no threats END
BEGIN NOW Gave heed, but waxing more in rage replied. END
BEGIN NOW Then when I am thy captive talk of chains, END
BEGIN NOW Proud limitary Cherub! but ere then END
BEGIN NOW Far heavier load thyself expect to feel END
BEGIN NOW From my prevailing arm, though Heaven's King END
BEGIN NOW Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers, END
BEGIN NOW Us'd to the yoke, drawest his triumphant wheels END
BEGIN NOW In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved. END
BEGIN NOW While thus he spake, the angelick squadron bright END
BEGIN NOW Turned fiery red, sharpening in mooned horns END
BEGIN NOW Their phalanx, and began to hem him round END
BEGIN NOW With ported spears, as thick as when a field END
BEGIN NOW Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends END
BEGIN NOW Her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind END
BEGIN NOW Sways them; the careful plowman doubting stands, END
BEGIN NOW Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves END
BEGIN NOW Prove chaff. On the other side, Satan, alarmed, END
BEGIN NOW Collecting all his might, dilated stood, END
BEGIN NOW Like Teneriff or Atlas, unremoved: END
BEGIN NOW His stature reached the sky, and on his crest END
BEGIN NOW Sat Horrour plumed; nor wanted in his grasp END
BEGIN NOW What seemed both spear and shield: Now dreadful deeds END
BEGIN NOW Might have ensued, nor only Paradise END
BEGIN NOW In this commotion, but the starry cope END
BEGIN NOW Of Heaven perhaps, or all the elements END
BEGIN NOW At least had gone to wrack, disturbed and torn END
BEGIN NOW With violence of this conflict, had not soon END
BEGIN NOW The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray, END
BEGIN NOW Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales, yet seen END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign, END
BEGIN NOW Wherein all things created first he weighed, END
BEGIN NOW The pendulous round earth with balanced air END
BEGIN NOW In counterpoise, now ponders all events, END
BEGIN NOW Battles and realms: In these he put two weights, END
BEGIN NOW The sequel each of parting and of fight: END
BEGIN NOW The latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam, END
BEGIN NOW Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. END
BEGIN NOW Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowest mine; END
BEGIN NOW Neither our own, but given: What folly then END
BEGIN NOW To boast what arms can do? since thine no more END
BEGIN NOW Than Heaven permits, nor mine, though doubled now END
BEGIN NOW To trample thee as mire: For proof look up, END
BEGIN NOW And read thy lot in yon celestial sign; END
BEGIN NOW Where thou art weighed, and shown how light, how weak, END
BEGIN NOW If thou resist. The Fiend looked up, and knew END
BEGIN NOW His mounted scale aloft: Nor more; but fled END
BEGIN NOW Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night. END
BEGIN NOW Now Morn, her rosy steps in the eastern clime END
BEGIN NOW Advancing, sowed the earth with orient pearl, END
BEGIN NOW When Adam waked, so customed; for his sleep END
BEGIN NOW Was aery-light, from pure digestion bred, END
BEGIN NOW And temperate vapours bland, which the only sound END
BEGIN NOW Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan, END
BEGIN NOW Lightly dispersed, and the shrill matin song END
BEGIN NOW Of birds on every bough; so much the more END
BEGIN NOW His wonder was to find unwakened Eve END
BEGIN NOW With tresses discomposed, and glowing cheek, END
BEGIN NOW As through unquiet rest: He, on his side END
BEGIN NOW Leaning half raised, with looks of cordial love END
BEGIN NOW Hung over her enamoured, and beheld END
BEGIN NOW Beauty, which, whether waking or asleep, END
BEGIN NOW Shot forth peculiar graces; then with voice END
BEGIN NOW Mild, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes, END
BEGIN NOW Her hand soft touching, whispered thus. Awake, END
BEGIN NOW My fairest, my espoused, my latest found, END
BEGIN NOW Heaven's last best gift, my ever new delight! END
BEGIN NOW Awake: The morning shines, and the fresh field END
BEGIN NOW Calls us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring END
BEGIN NOW Our tender plants, how blows the citron grove, END
BEGIN NOW What drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed, END
BEGIN NOW How nature paints her colours, how the bee END
BEGIN NOW Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet. END
BEGIN NOW Such whispering waked her, but with startled eye END
BEGIN NOW On Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake. END
BEGIN NOW O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose, END
BEGIN NOW My glory, my perfection! glad I see END
BEGIN NOW Thy face, and morn returned; for I this night END
BEGIN NOW (Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed, END
BEGIN NOW If dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee, END
BEGIN NOW Works of day past, or morrow's next design, END
BEGIN NOW But of offence and trouble, which my mind END
BEGIN NOW Knew never till this irksome night: Methought, END
BEGIN NOW Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk END
BEGIN NOW With gentle voice; I thought it thine: It said, END
BEGIN NOW Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time, END
BEGIN NOW The cool, the silent, save where silence yields END
BEGIN NOW To the night-warbling bird, that now awake END
BEGIN NOW Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns END
BEGIN NOW Full-orbed the moon, and with more pleasing light END
BEGIN NOW Shadowy sets off the face of things; in vain, END
BEGIN NOW If none regard; Heaven wakes with all his eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire? END
BEGIN NOW In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment END
BEGIN NOW Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze. END
BEGIN NOW I rose as at thy call, but found thee not; END
BEGIN NOW To find thee I directed then my walk; END
BEGIN NOW And on, methought, alone I passed through ways END
BEGIN NOW That brought me on a sudden to the tree END
BEGIN NOW Of interdicted knowledge: fair it seemed, END
BEGIN NOW Much fairer to my fancy than by day: END
BEGIN NOW And, as I wondering looked, beside it stood END
BEGIN NOW One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven END
BEGIN NOW By us oft seen; his dewy locks distilled END
BEGIN NOW Ambrosia; on that tree he also gazed; END
BEGIN NOW And "O fair plant," said he, "with fruit surcharged, END
BEGIN NOW Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet, END
BEGIN NOW Nor God, nor Man? Is knowledge so despised? END
BEGIN NOW Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste? END
BEGIN NOW Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold END
BEGIN NOW Longer thy offered good; why else set here? END
BEGIN NOW This said, he paused not, but with venturous arm END
BEGIN NOW He plucked, he tasted; me damp horrour chilled END
BEGIN NOW At such bold words vouched with a deed so bold: END
BEGIN NOW But he thus, overjoyed; "O fruit divine, END
BEGIN NOW Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt, END
BEGIN NOW Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit END
BEGIN NOW For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men: END
BEGIN NOW And why not Gods of Men; since good, the more END
BEGIN NOW Communicated, more abundant grows, END
BEGIN NOW The author not impaired, but honoured more? END
BEGIN NOW Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve! END
BEGIN NOW Partake thou also; happy though thou art, END
BEGIN NOW Happier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be: END
BEGIN NOW Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods END
BEGIN NOW Thyself a Goddess, not to earth confined, END
BEGIN NOW But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes END
BEGIN NOW Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see END
BEGIN NOW What life the Gods live there, and such live thou! END
BEGIN NOW So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held, END
BEGIN NOW Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part END
BEGIN NOW Which he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smell END
BEGIN NOW So quickened appetite, that I, methought, END
BEGIN NOW Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the clouds END
BEGIN NOW With him I flew, and underneath beheld END
BEGIN NOW The earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide END
BEGIN NOW And various: Wondering at my flight and change END
BEGIN NOW To this high exaltation; suddenly END
BEGIN NOW My guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down, END
BEGIN NOW And fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked END
BEGIN NOW To find this but a dream! Thus Eve her night END
BEGIN NOW Related, and thus Adam answered sad. END
BEGIN NOW Best image of myself, and dearer half, END
BEGIN NOW The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep END
BEGIN NOW Affects me equally; nor can I like END
BEGIN NOW This uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear; END
BEGIN NOW Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none, END
BEGIN NOW Created pure. But know that in the soul END
BEGIN NOW Are many lesser faculties, that serve END
BEGIN NOW Reason as chief; among these Fancy next END
BEGIN NOW Her office holds; of all external things END
BEGIN NOW Which the five watchful senses represent, END
BEGIN NOW She forms imaginations, aery shapes, END
BEGIN NOW Which Reason, joining or disjoining, frames END
BEGIN NOW All what we affirm or what deny, and call END
BEGIN NOW Our knowledge or opinion; then retires END
BEGIN NOW Into her private cell, when nature rests. END
BEGIN NOW Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes END
BEGIN NOW To imitate her; but, misjoining shapes, END
BEGIN NOW Wild work produces oft, and most in dreams; END
BEGIN NOW Ill matching words and deeds long past or late. END
BEGIN NOW Some such resemblances, methinks, I find END
BEGIN NOW Of our last evening's talk, in this thy dream, END
BEGIN NOW But with addition strange; yet be not sad. END
BEGIN NOW Evil into the mind of God or Man END
BEGIN NOW May come and go, so unreproved, and leave END
BEGIN NOW No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope END
BEGIN NOW That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream, END
BEGIN NOW Waking thou never will consent to do. END
BEGIN NOW Be not disheartened then, nor cloud those looks, END
BEGIN NOW That wont to be more cheerful and serene, END
BEGIN NOW Than when fair morning first smiles on the world; END
BEGIN NOW And let us to our fresh employments rise END
BEGIN NOW Among the groves, the fountains, and the flowers END
BEGIN NOW That open now their choisest bosomed smells, END
BEGIN NOW Reserved from night, and kept for thee in store. END
BEGIN NOW So cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered; END
BEGIN NOW But silently a gentle tear let fall END
BEGIN NOW From either eye, and wiped them with her hair; END
BEGIN NOW Two other precious drops that ready stood, END
BEGIN NOW Each in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell END
BEGIN NOW Kissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse END
BEGIN NOW And pious awe, that feared to have offended. END
BEGIN NOW So all was cleared, and to the field they haste. END
BEGIN NOW But first, from under shady arborous roof END
BEGIN NOW Soon as they forth were come to open sight END
BEGIN NOW Of day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen, END
BEGIN NOW With wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim, END
BEGIN NOW Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray, END
BEGIN NOW Discovering in wide landskip all the east END
BEGIN NOW Of Paradise and Eden's happy plains, END
BEGIN NOW Lowly they bowed adoring, and began END
BEGIN NOW Their orisons, each morning duly paid END
BEGIN NOW In various style; for neither various style END
BEGIN NOW Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise END
BEGIN NOW Their Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung END
BEGIN NOW Unmeditated; such prompt eloquence END
BEGIN NOW Flowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse, END
BEGIN NOW More tuneable than needed lute or harp END
BEGIN NOW To add more sweetness; and they thus began. END
BEGIN NOW These are thy glorious works, Parent of good, END
BEGIN NOW Almighty! Thine this universal frame, END
BEGIN NOW Thus wonderous fair; Thyself how wonderous then! END
BEGIN NOW Unspeakable, who sitst above these heavens END
BEGIN NOW To us invisible, or dimly seen END
BEGIN NOW In these thy lowest works; yet these declare END
BEGIN NOW Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine. END
BEGIN NOW Speak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light, END
BEGIN NOW Angels; for ye behold him, and with songs END
BEGIN NOW And choral symphonies, day without night, END
BEGIN NOW Circle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven END
BEGIN NOW On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol END
BEGIN NOW Him first, him last, him midst, and without end. END
BEGIN NOW Fairest of stars, last in the train of night, END
BEGIN NOW If better thou belong not to the dawn, END
BEGIN NOW Sure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn END
BEGIN NOW With thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere, END
BEGIN NOW While day arises, that sweet hour of prime. END
BEGIN NOW Thou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul, END
BEGIN NOW Acknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise END
BEGIN NOW In thy eternal course, both when thou climbest, END
BEGIN NOW And when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest. END
BEGIN NOW Moon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest, END
BEGIN NOW With the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies; END
BEGIN NOW And ye five other wandering Fires, that move END
BEGIN NOW In mystick dance not without song, resound END
BEGIN NOW His praise, who out of darkness called up light. END
BEGIN NOW Air, and ye Elements, the eldest birth END
BEGIN NOW Of Nature's womb, that in quaternion run END
BEGIN NOW Perpetual circle, multiform; and mix END
BEGIN NOW And nourish all things; let your ceaseless change END
BEGIN NOW Vary to our great Maker still new praise. END
BEGIN NOW Ye Mists and Exhalations, that now rise END
BEGIN NOW From hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray, END
BEGIN NOW Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold, END
BEGIN NOW In honour to the world's great Author rise; END
BEGIN NOW Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky, END
BEGIN NOW Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers, END
BEGIN NOW Rising or falling still advance his praise. END
BEGIN NOW His praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow, END
BEGIN NOW Breathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines, END
BEGIN NOW With every plant, in sign of worship wave. END
BEGIN NOW Fountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow, END
BEGIN NOW Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise. END
BEGIN NOW Join voices, all ye living Souls: Ye Birds, END
BEGIN NOW That singing up to Heaven-gate ascend, END
BEGIN NOW Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise. END
BEGIN NOW Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk END
BEGIN NOW The earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep; END
BEGIN NOW Witness if I be silent, morn or even, END
BEGIN NOW To hill, or valley, fountain, or fresh shade, END
BEGIN NOW Made vocal by my song, and taught his praise. END
BEGIN NOW Hail, universal Lord, be bounteous still END
BEGIN NOW To give us only good; and if the night END
BEGIN NOW Have gathered aught of evil, or concealed, END
BEGIN NOW Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark! END
BEGIN NOW So prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts END
BEGIN NOW Firm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm. END
BEGIN NOW On to their morning's rural work they haste, END
BEGIN NOW Among sweet dews and flowers; where any row END
BEGIN NOW Of fruit-trees over-woody reached too far END
BEGIN NOW Their pampered boughs, and needed hands to check END
BEGIN NOW Fruitless embraces: or they led the vine END
BEGIN NOW To wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines END
BEGIN NOW Her marriageable arms, and with him brings END
BEGIN NOW Her dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn END
BEGIN NOW His barren leaves. Them thus employed beheld END
BEGIN NOW With pity Heaven's high King, and to him called END
BEGIN NOW Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned END
BEGIN NOW To travel with Tobias, and secured END
BEGIN NOW His marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid. END
BEGIN NOW Raphael, said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth END
BEGIN NOW Satan, from Hell 'scaped through the darksome gulf, END
BEGIN NOW Hath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed END
BEGIN NOW This night the human pair; how he designs END
BEGIN NOW In them at once to ruin all mankind. END
BEGIN NOW Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend END
BEGIN NOW Converse with Adam, in what bower or shade END
BEGIN NOW Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired, END
BEGIN NOW To respite his day-labour with repast, END
BEGIN NOW Or with repose; and such discourse bring on, END
BEGIN NOW As may advise him of his happy state, END
BEGIN NOW Happiness in his power left free to will, END
BEGIN NOW Left to his own free will, his will though free, END
BEGIN NOW Yet mutable; whence warn him to beware END
BEGIN NOW He swerve not, too secure: Tell him withal END
BEGIN NOW His danger, and from whom; what enemy, END
BEGIN NOW Late fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now END
BEGIN NOW The fall of others from like state of bliss; END
BEGIN NOW By violence? no, for that shall be withstood; END
BEGIN NOW But by deceit and lies: This let him know, END
BEGIN NOW Lest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend END
BEGIN NOW Surprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled END
BEGIN NOW All justice: Nor delayed the winged Saint END
BEGIN NOW After his charge received; but from among END
BEGIN NOW Thousand celestial Ardours, where he stood END
BEGIN NOW Veiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light, END
BEGIN NOW Flew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires, END
BEGIN NOW On each hand parting, to his speed gave way END
BEGIN NOW Through all the empyreal road; till, at the gate END
BEGIN NOW Of Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide END
BEGIN NOW On golden hinges turning, as by work END
BEGIN NOW Divine the sovran Architect had framed. END
BEGIN NOW From hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight, END
BEGIN NOW Star interposed, however small he sees, END
BEGIN NOW Not unconformed to other shining globes, END
BEGIN NOW Earth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned END
BEGIN NOW Above all hills. As when by night the glass END
BEGIN NOW Of Galileo, less assured, observes END
BEGIN NOW Imagined lands and regions in the moon: END
BEGIN NOW Or pilot, from amidst the Cyclades END
BEGIN NOW Delos or Samos first appearing, kens END
BEGIN NOW A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight END
BEGIN NOW He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky END
BEGIN NOW Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing END
BEGIN NOW Now on the polar winds, then with quick fan END
BEGIN NOW Winnows the buxom air; till, within soar END
BEGIN NOW Of towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems END
BEGIN NOW A phoenix, gazed by all as that sole bird, END
BEGIN NOW When, to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's END
BEGIN NOW At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise END
BEGIN NOW He lights, and to his proper shape returns END
BEGIN NOW A Seraph winged: Six wings he wore, to shade END
BEGIN NOW His lineaments divine; the pair that clad END
BEGIN NOW Each shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast END
BEGIN NOW With regal ornament; the middle pair END
BEGIN NOW Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round END
BEGIN NOW Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold END
BEGIN NOW And colours dipt in Heaven; the third his feet END
BEGIN NOW Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail, END
BEGIN NOW Sky-tinctured grain. Like Maia's son he stood, END
BEGIN NOW And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled END
BEGIN NOW The circuit wide. Straight knew him all the bands END
BEGIN NOW Of Angels under watch; and to his state, END
BEGIN NOW And to his message high, in honour rise; END
BEGIN NOW For on some message high they guessed him bound. END
BEGIN NOW Their glittering tents he passed, and now is come END
BEGIN NOW Into the blissful field, through groves of myrrh, END
BEGIN NOW And flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm; END
BEGIN NOW A wilderness of sweets; for Nature here END
BEGIN NOW Wantoned as in her prime, and played at will END
BEGIN NOW Her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet, END
BEGIN NOW Wild above rule or art, enormous bliss. END
BEGIN NOW Him through the spicy forest onward come END
BEGIN NOW Adam discerned, as in the door he sat END
BEGIN NOW Of his cool bower, while now the mounted sun END
BEGIN NOW Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm END
BEGIN NOW Earth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs: END
BEGIN NOW And Eve within, due at her hour prepared END
BEGIN NOW For dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please END
BEGIN NOW True appetite, and not disrelish thirst END
BEGIN NOW Of nectarous draughts between, from milky stream, END
BEGIN NOW Berry or grape: To whom thus Adam called. END
BEGIN NOW Haste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold END
BEGIN NOW Eastward among those trees, what glorious shape END
BEGIN NOW Comes this way moving; seems another morn END
BEGIN NOW Risen on mid-noon; some great behest from Heaven END
BEGIN NOW To us perhaps he brings, and will vouchsafe END
BEGIN NOW This day to be our guest. But go with speed, END
BEGIN NOW And, what thy stores contain, bring forth, and pour END
BEGIN NOW Abundance, fit to honour and receive END
BEGIN NOW Our heavenly stranger: Well we may afford END
BEGIN NOW Our givers their own gifts, and large bestow END
BEGIN NOW From large bestowed, where Nature multiplies END
BEGIN NOW Her fertile growth, and by disburthening grows END
BEGIN NOW More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Eve. Adam, earth's hallowed mould, END
BEGIN NOW Of God inspired! small store will serve, where store, END
BEGIN NOW All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk; END
BEGIN NOW Save what by frugal storing firmness gains END
BEGIN NOW To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: END
BEGIN NOW But I will haste, and from each bough and brake, END
BEGIN NOW Each plant and juciest gourd, will pluck such choice END
BEGIN NOW To entertain our Angel-guest, as he END
BEGIN NOW Beholding shall confess, that here on Earth END
BEGIN NOW God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste END
BEGIN NOW She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent END
BEGIN NOW What choice to choose for delicacy best, END
BEGIN NOW What order, so contrived as not to mix END
BEGIN NOW Tastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring END
BEGIN NOW Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change; END
BEGIN NOW Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk END
BEGIN NOW Whatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields END
BEGIN NOW In India East or West, or middle shore END
BEGIN NOW In Pontus or the Punick coast, or where END
BEGIN NOW Alcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat END
BEGIN NOW Rough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell, END
BEGIN NOW She gathers, tribute large, and on the board END
BEGIN NOW Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape END
BEGIN NOW She crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths END
BEGIN NOW From many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed END
BEGIN NOW She tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold END
BEGIN NOW Wants her fit vessels pure; then strows the ground END
BEGIN NOW With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed. END
BEGIN NOW Mean while our primitive great sire, to meet END
BEGIN NOW His God-like guest, walks forth, without more train END
BEGIN NOW Accompanied than with his own complete END
BEGIN NOW Perfections; in himself was all his state, END
BEGIN NOW More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits END
BEGIN NOW On princes, when their rich retinue long END
BEGIN NOW Of horses led, and grooms besmeared with gold, END
BEGIN NOW Dazzles the croud, and sets them all agape. END
BEGIN NOW Nearer his presence Adam, though not awed, END
BEGIN NOW Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek, END
BEGIN NOW As to a superiour nature bowing low, END
BEGIN NOW Thus said. Native of Heaven, for other place END
BEGIN NOW None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain; END
BEGIN NOW Since, by descending from the thrones above, END
BEGIN NOW Those happy places thou hast deigned a while END
BEGIN NOW To want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us END
BEGIN NOW Two only, who yet by sovran gift possess END
BEGIN NOW This spacious ground, in yonder shady bower END
BEGIN NOW To rest; and what the garden choicest bears END
BEGIN NOW To sit and taste, till this meridian heat END
BEGIN NOW Be over, and the sun more cool decline. END
BEGIN NOW Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild. END
BEGIN NOW Adam, I therefore came; nor art thou such END
BEGIN NOW Created, or such place hast here to dwell, END
BEGIN NOW As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW To visit thee; lead on then where thy bower END
BEGIN NOW O'ershades; for these mid-hours, till evening rise, END
BEGIN NOW I have at will. So to the sylvan lodge END
BEGIN NOW They came, that like Pomona's arbour smiled, END
BEGIN NOW With flowerets decked, and fragrant smells; but Eve, END
BEGIN NOW Undecked save with herself, more lovely fair END
BEGIN NOW Than Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feigned END
BEGIN NOW Of three that in mount Ida naked strove, END
BEGIN NOW Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil END
BEGIN NOW She needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm END
BEGIN NOW Altered her cheek. On whom the Angel Hail END
BEGIN NOW Bestowed, the holy salutation used END
BEGIN NOW Long after to blest Mary, second Eve. END
BEGIN NOW Hail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb END
BEGIN NOW Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons, END
BEGIN NOW Than with these various fruits the trees of God END
BEGIN NOW Have heaped this table!--Raised of grassy turf END
BEGIN NOW Their table was, and mossy seats had round, END
BEGIN NOW And on her ample square from side to side END
BEGIN NOW All autumn piled, though spring and autumn here END
BEGIN NOW Danced hand in hand. A while discourse they hold; END
BEGIN NOW No fear lest dinner cool; when thus began END
BEGIN NOW Our author. Heavenly stranger, please to taste END
BEGIN NOW These bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom END
BEGIN NOW All perfect good, unmeasured out, descends, END
BEGIN NOW To us for food and for delight hath caused END
BEGIN NOW The earth to yield; unsavoury food perhaps END
BEGIN NOW To spiritual natures; only this I know, END
BEGIN NOW That one celestial Father gives to all. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives END
BEGIN NOW (Whose praise be ever sung) to Man in part END
BEGIN NOW Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found END
BEGIN NOW No ingrateful food: And food alike those pure END
BEGIN NOW Intelligential substances require, END
BEGIN NOW As doth your rational; and both contain END
BEGIN NOW Within them every lower faculty END
BEGIN NOW Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste, END
BEGIN NOW Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate, END
BEGIN NOW And corporeal to incorporeal turn. END
BEGIN NOW For know, whatever was created, needs END
BEGIN NOW To be sustained and fed: Of elements END
BEGIN NOW The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea, END
BEGIN NOW Earth and the sea feed air, the air those fires END
BEGIN NOW Ethereal, and as lowest first the moon; END
BEGIN NOW Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurged END
BEGIN NOW Vapours not yet into her substance turned. END
BEGIN NOW Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale END
BEGIN NOW From her moist continent to higher orbs. END
BEGIN NOW The sun that light imparts to all, receives END
BEGIN NOW From all his alimental recompence END
BEGIN NOW In humid exhalations, and at even END
BEGIN NOW Sups with the ocean. Though in Heaven the trees END
BEGIN NOW Of life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines END
BEGIN NOW Yield nectar; though from off the boughs each morn END
BEGIN NOW We brush mellifluous dews, and find the ground END
BEGIN NOW Covered with pearly grain: Yet God hath here END
BEGIN NOW Varied his bounty so with new delights, END
BEGIN NOW As may compare with Heaven; and to taste END
BEGIN NOW Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat, END
BEGIN NOW And to their viands fell; nor seemingly END
BEGIN NOW The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss END
BEGIN NOW Of Theologians; but with keen dispatch END
BEGIN NOW Of real hunger, and concoctive heat END
BEGIN NOW To transubstantiate: What redounds, transpires END
BEGIN NOW Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire END
BEGIN NOW Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist END
BEGIN NOW Can turn, or holds it possible to turn, END
BEGIN NOW Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold, END
BEGIN NOW As from the mine. Mean while at table Eve END
BEGIN NOW Ministered naked, and their flowing cups END
BEGIN NOW With pleasant liquours crowned: O innocence END
BEGIN NOW Deserving Paradise! if ever, then, END
BEGIN NOW Then had the sons of God excuse to have been END
BEGIN NOW Enamoured at that sight; but in those hearts END
BEGIN NOW Love unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy END
BEGIN NOW Was understood, the injured lover's hell. END
BEGIN NOW Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed, END
BEGIN NOW Not burdened nature, sudden mind arose END
BEGIN NOW In Adam, not to let the occasion pass END
BEGIN NOW Given him by this great conference to know END
BEGIN NOW Of things above his world, and of their being END
BEGIN NOW Who dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw END
BEGIN NOW Transcend his own so far; whose radiant forms, END
BEGIN NOW Divine effulgence, whose high power, so far END
BEGIN NOW Exceeded human; and his wary speech END
BEGIN NOW Thus to the empyreal minister he framed. END
BEGIN NOW Inhabitant with God, now know I well END
BEGIN NOW Thy favour, in this honour done to Man; END
BEGIN NOW Under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed END
BEGIN NOW To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste, END
BEGIN NOW Food not of Angels, yet accepted so, END
BEGIN NOW As that more willingly thou couldst not seem END
BEGIN NOW At Heaven's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare END
BEGIN NOW To whom the winged Hierarch replied. END
BEGIN NOW O Adam, One Almighty is, from whom END
BEGIN NOW All things proceed, and up to him return, END
BEGIN NOW If not depraved from good, created all END
BEGIN NOW Such to perfection, one first matter all, END
BEGIN NOW Endued with various forms, various degrees END
BEGIN NOW Of substance, and, in things that live, of life; END
BEGIN NOW But more refined, more spiritous, and pure, END
BEGIN NOW As nearer to him placed, or nearer tending END
BEGIN NOW Each in their several active spheres assigned, END
BEGIN NOW Till body up to spirit work, in bounds END
BEGIN NOW Proportioned to each kind. So from the root END
BEGIN NOW Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves END
BEGIN NOW More aery, last the bright consummate flower END
BEGIN NOW Spirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit, END
BEGIN NOW Man's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed, END
BEGIN NOW To vital spirits aspire, to animal, END
BEGIN NOW To intellectual; give both life and sense, END
BEGIN NOW Fancy and understanding; whence the soul END
BEGIN NOW Reason receives, and reason is her being, END
BEGIN NOW Discursive, or intuitive; discourse END
BEGIN NOW Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, END
BEGIN NOW Differing but in degree, of kind the same. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder not then, what God for you saw good END
BEGIN NOW If I refuse not, but convert, as you END
BEGIN NOW To proper substance. Time may come, when Men END
BEGIN NOW With Angels may participate, and find END
BEGIN NOW No inconvenient diet, nor too light fare; END
BEGIN NOW And from these corporal nutriments perhaps END
BEGIN NOW Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit, END
BEGIN NOW Improved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend END
BEGIN NOW Ethereal, as we; or may, at choice, END
BEGIN NOW Here or in heavenly Paradises dwell; END
BEGIN NOW If ye be found obedient, and retain END
BEGIN NOW Unalterably firm his love entire, END
BEGIN NOW Whose progeny you are. Mean while enjoy END
BEGIN NOW Your fill what happiness this happy state END
BEGIN NOW Can comprehend, incapable of more. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the patriarch of mankind replied. END
BEGIN NOW O favourable Spirit, propitious guest, END
BEGIN NOW Well hast thou taught the way that might direct END
BEGIN NOW Our knowledge, and the scale of nature set END
BEGIN NOW From center to circumference; whereon, END
BEGIN NOW In contemplation of created things, END
BEGIN NOW By steps we may ascend to God. But say, END
BEGIN NOW What meant that caution joined, If ye be found END
BEGIN NOW Obedient? Can we want obedience then END
BEGIN NOW To him, or possibly his love desert, END
BEGIN NOW Who formed us from the dust and placed us here END
BEGIN NOW Full to the utmost measure of what bliss END
BEGIN NOW Human desires can seek or apprehend? END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Angel. Son of Heaven and Earth, END
BEGIN NOW Attend! That thou art happy, owe to God; END
BEGIN NOW That thou continuest such, owe to thyself, END
BEGIN NOW That is, to thy obedience; therein stand. END
BEGIN NOW This was that caution given thee; be advised. END
BEGIN NOW God made thee perfect, not immutable; END
BEGIN NOW And good he made thee, but to persevere END
BEGIN NOW He left it in thy power; ordained thy will END
BEGIN NOW By nature free, not over-ruled by fate END
BEGIN NOW Inextricable, or strict necessity: END
BEGIN NOW Our voluntary service he requires, END
BEGIN NOW Not our necessitated; such with him END
BEGIN NOW Finds no acceptance, nor can find; for how END
BEGIN NOW Can hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve END
BEGIN NOW Willing or no, who will but what they must END
BEGIN NOW By destiny, and can no other choose? END
BEGIN NOW Myself, and all the angelick host, that stand END
BEGIN NOW In sight of God, enthroned, our happy state END
BEGIN NOW Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds; END
BEGIN NOW On other surety none: Freely we serve, END
BEGIN NOW Because we freely love, as in our will END
BEGIN NOW To love or not; in this we stand or fall: END
BEGIN NOW And some are fallen, to disobedience fallen, END
BEGIN NOW And so from Heaven to deepest Hell; O fall END
BEGIN NOW From what high state of bliss, into what woe! END
BEGIN NOW To whom our great progenitor. Thy words END
BEGIN NOW Attentive, and with more delighted ear, END
BEGIN NOW Divine instructer, I have heard, than when END
BEGIN NOW Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills END
BEGIN NOW Aereal musick send: Nor knew I not END
BEGIN NOW To be both will and deed created free; END
BEGIN NOW Yet that we never shall forget to love END
BEGIN NOW Our Maker, and obey him whose command END
BEGIN NOW Single is yet so just, my constant thoughts END
BEGIN NOW Assured me, and still assure: Though what thou tellest END
BEGIN NOW Hath passed in Heaven, some doubt within me move, END
BEGIN NOW But more desire to hear, if thou consent, END
BEGIN NOW The full relation, which must needs be strange, END
BEGIN NOW Worthy of sacred silence to be heard; END
BEGIN NOW And we have yet large day, for scarce the sun END
BEGIN NOW Hath finished half his journey, and scarce begins END
BEGIN NOW His other half in the great zone of Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Adam made request; and Raphael, END
BEGIN NOW After short pause assenting, thus began. END
BEGIN NOW High matter thou enjoinest me, O prime of men, END
BEGIN NOW Sad task and hard: For how shall I relate END
BEGIN NOW To human sense the invisible exploits END
BEGIN NOW Of warring Spirits? how, without remorse, END
BEGIN NOW The ruin of so many glorious once END
BEGIN NOW And perfect while they stood? how last unfold END
BEGIN NOW The secrets of another world, perhaps END
BEGIN NOW Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good END
BEGIN NOW This is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach END
BEGIN NOW Of human sense, I shall delineate so, END
BEGIN NOW By likening spiritual to corporal forms, END
BEGIN NOW As may express them best; though what if Earth END
BEGIN NOW Be but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein END
BEGIN NOW Each to other like, more than on earth is thought? END
BEGIN NOW As yet this world was not, and Chaos wild END
BEGIN NOW Reigned where these Heavens now roll, where Earth now rests END
BEGIN NOW Upon her center poised; when on a day END
BEGIN NOW (For time, though in eternity, applied END
BEGIN NOW To motion, measures all things durable END
BEGIN NOW By present, past, and future,) on such day END
BEGIN NOW As Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host END
BEGIN NOW Of Angels by imperial summons called, END
BEGIN NOW Innumerable before the Almighty's throne END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith, from all the ends of Heaven, appeared END
BEGIN NOW Under their Hierarchs in orders bright: END
BEGIN NOW Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced, END
BEGIN NOW Standards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear END
BEGIN NOW Stream in the air, and for distinction serve END
BEGIN NOW Of hierarchies, of orders, and degrees; END
BEGIN NOW Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed END
BEGIN NOW Holy memorials, acts of zeal and love END
BEGIN NOW Recorded eminent. Thus when in orbs END
BEGIN NOW Of circuit inexpressible they stood, END
BEGIN NOW Orb within orb, the Father Infinite, END
BEGIN NOW By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son, END
BEGIN NOW Amidst as from a flaming mount, whose top END
BEGIN NOW Brightness had made invisible, thus spake. END
BEGIN NOW Hear, all ye Angels, progeny of light, END
BEGIN NOW Hear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand. END
BEGIN NOW This day I have begot whom I declare END
BEGIN NOW My only Son, and on this holy hill END
BEGIN NOW Him have anointed, whom ye now behold END
BEGIN NOW At my right hand; your head I him appoint; END
BEGIN NOW And by myself have sworn, to him shall bow END
BEGIN NOW All knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord: END
BEGIN NOW Under his great vice-gerent reign abide END
BEGIN NOW United, as one individual soul, END
BEGIN NOW For ever happy: Him who disobeys, END
BEGIN NOW Me disobeys, breaks union, and that day, END
BEGIN NOW Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls END
BEGIN NOW Into utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place END
BEGIN NOW Ordained without redemption, without end. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Omnipotent, and with his words END
BEGIN NOW All seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all. END
BEGIN NOW That day, as other solemn days, they spent END
BEGIN NOW In song and dance about the sacred hill; END
BEGIN NOW Mystical dance, which yonder starry sphere END
BEGIN NOW Of planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels END
BEGIN NOW Resembles nearest, mazes intricate, END
BEGIN NOW Eccentrick, intervolved, yet regular END
BEGIN NOW Then most, when most irregular they seem; END
BEGIN NOW And in their motions harmony divine END
BEGIN NOW So smooths her charming tones, that God's own ear END
BEGIN NOW Listens delighted. Evening now approached, END
BEGIN NOW (For we have also our evening and our morn, END
BEGIN NOW We ours for change delectable, not need;) END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn END
BEGIN NOW Desirous; all in circles as they stood, END
BEGIN NOW Tables are set, and on a sudden piled END
BEGIN NOW With Angels food, and rubied nectar flows END
BEGIN NOW In pearl, in diamond, and massy gold, END
BEGIN NOW Fruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW On flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned, END
BEGIN NOW They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet END
BEGIN NOW Quaff immortality and joy, secure END
BEGIN NOW Of surfeit, where full measure only bounds END
BEGIN NOW Excess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered END
BEGIN NOW With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy. END
BEGIN NOW Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled END
BEGIN NOW From that high mount of God, whence light and shade END
BEGIN NOW Spring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed END
BEGIN NOW To grateful twilight, (for night comes not there END
BEGIN NOW In darker veil) and roseate dews disposed END
BEGIN NOW All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest; END
BEGIN NOW Wide over all the plain, and wider far END
BEGIN NOW Than all this globous earth in plain outspread, END
BEGIN NOW (Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng, END
BEGIN NOW Dispersed in bands and files, their camp extend END
BEGIN NOW By living streams among the trees of life, END
BEGIN NOW Pavilions numberless, and sudden reared, END
BEGIN NOW Celestial tabernacles, where they slept END
BEGIN NOW Fanned with cool winds; save those, who, in their course, END
BEGIN NOW Melodious hymns about the sovran throne END
BEGIN NOW Alternate all night long: but not so waked END
BEGIN NOW Satan; so call him now, his former name END
BEGIN NOW Is heard no more in Heaven; he of the first, END
BEGIN NOW If not the first Arch-Angel, great in power, END
BEGIN NOW In favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught END
BEGIN NOW With envy against the Son of God, that day END
BEGIN NOW Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed END
BEGIN NOW Messiah King anointed, could not bear END
BEGIN NOW Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaired. END
BEGIN NOW Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain, END
BEGIN NOW Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour END
BEGIN NOW Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved END
BEGIN NOW With all his legions to dislodge, and leave END
BEGIN NOW Unworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme, END
BEGIN NOW Contemptuous; and his next subordinate END
BEGIN NOW Awakening, thus to him in secret spake. END
BEGIN NOW Sleepest thou, Companion dear? What sleep can close END
BEGIN NOW Thy eye-lids? and rememberest what decree END
BEGIN NOW Of yesterday, so late hath passed the lips END
BEGIN NOW Of Heaven's Almighty. Thou to me thy thoughts END
BEGIN NOW Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart; END
BEGIN NOW Both waking we were one; how then can now END
BEGIN NOW Thy sleep dissent? New laws thou seest imposed; END
BEGIN NOW New laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise END
BEGIN NOW In us who serve, new counsels to debate END
BEGIN NOW What doubtful may ensue: More in this place END
BEGIN NOW To utter is not safe. Assemble thou END
BEGIN NOW Of all those myriads which we lead the chief; END
BEGIN NOW Tell them, that by command, ere yet dim night END
BEGIN NOW Her shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste, END
BEGIN NOW And all who under me their banners wave, END
BEGIN NOW Homeward, with flying march, where we possess END
BEGIN NOW The quarters of the north; there to prepare END
BEGIN NOW Fit entertainment to receive our King, END
BEGIN NOW The great Messiah, and his new commands, END
BEGIN NOW Who speedily through all the hierarchies END
BEGIN NOW Intends to pass triumphant, and give laws. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused END
BEGIN NOW Bad influence into the unwary breast END
BEGIN NOW Of his associate: He together calls, END
BEGIN NOW Or several one by one, the regent Powers, END
BEGIN NOW Under him Regent; tells, as he was taught, END
BEGIN NOW That the Most High commanding, now ere night, END
BEGIN NOW Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW The great hierarchal standard was to move; END
BEGIN NOW Tells the suggested cause, and casts between END
BEGIN NOW Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound END
BEGIN NOW Or taint integrity: But all obeyed END
BEGIN NOW The wonted signal, and superiour voice END
BEGIN NOW Of their great Potentate; for great indeed END
BEGIN NOW His name, and high was his degree in Heaven; END
BEGIN NOW His countenance, as the morning-star that guides END
BEGIN NOW The starry flock, allured them, and with lies END
BEGIN NOW Drew after him the third part of Heaven's host. END
BEGIN NOW Mean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns END
BEGIN NOW Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount, END
BEGIN NOW And from within the golden lamps that burn END
BEGIN NOW Nightly before him, saw without their light END
BEGIN NOW Rebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread END
BEGIN NOW Among the sons of morn, what multitudes END
BEGIN NOW Were banded to oppose his high decree; END
BEGIN NOW And, smiling, to his only Son thus said. END
BEGIN NOW Son, thou in whom my glory I behold END
BEGIN NOW In full resplendence, Heir of all my might, END
BEGIN NOW Nearly it now concerns us to be sure END
BEGIN NOW Of our Omnipotence, and with what arms END
BEGIN NOW We mean to hold what anciently we claim END
BEGIN NOW Of deity or empire: Such a foe END
BEGIN NOW Is rising, who intends to erect his throne END
BEGIN NOW Equal to ours, throughout the spacious north; END
BEGIN NOW Nor so content, hath in his thought to try END
BEGIN NOW In battle, what our power is, or our right. END
BEGIN NOW Let us advise, and to this hazard draw END
BEGIN NOW With speed what force is left, and all employ END
BEGIN NOW In our defence; lest unawares we lose END
BEGIN NOW This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear, END
BEGIN NOW Lightning divine, ineffable, serene, END
BEGIN NOW Made answer. Mighty Father, thou thy foes END
BEGIN NOW Justly hast in derision, and, secure, END
BEGIN NOW Laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain, END
BEGIN NOW Matter to me of glory, whom their hate END
BEGIN NOW Illustrates, when they see all regal power END
BEGIN NOW Given me to quell their pride, and in event END
BEGIN NOW Know whether I be dextrous to subdue END
BEGIN NOW Thy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers, END
BEGIN NOW Far was advanced on winged speed; an host END
BEGIN NOW Innumerable as the stars of night, END
BEGIN NOW Or stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun END
BEGIN NOW Impearls on every leaf and every flower. END
BEGIN NOW Regions they passed, the mighty regencies END
BEGIN NOW In their triple degrees; regions to which END
BEGIN NOW All thy dominion, Adam, is no more END
BEGIN NOW Than what this garden is to all the earth, END
BEGIN NOW And all the sea, from one entire globose END
BEGIN NOW Stretched into longitude; which having passed, END
BEGIN NOW At length into the limits of the north END
BEGIN NOW They came; and Satan to his royal seat END
BEGIN NOW High on a hill, far blazing, as a mount END
BEGIN NOW Raised on a mount, with pyramids and towers END
BEGIN NOW From diamond quarries hewn, and rocks of gold; END
BEGIN NOW The palace of great Lucifer, (so call END
BEGIN NOW That structure in the dialect of men END
BEGIN NOW Interpreted,) which not long after, he END
BEGIN NOW Affecting all equality with God, END
BEGIN NOW In imitation of that mount whereon END
BEGIN NOW Messiah was declared in sight of Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW The Mountain of the Congregation called; END
BEGIN NOW For thither he assembled all his train, END
BEGIN NOW Pretending so commanded to consult END
BEGIN NOW About the great reception of their King, END
BEGIN NOW Thither to come, and with calumnious art END
BEGIN NOW Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears. END
BEGIN NOW If these magnifick titles yet remain END
BEGIN NOW Not merely titular, since by decree END
BEGIN NOW Another now hath to himself engrossed END
BEGIN NOW All power, and us eclipsed under the name END
BEGIN NOW Of King anointed, for whom all this haste END
BEGIN NOW Of midnight-march, and hurried meeting here, END
BEGIN NOW This only to consult how we may best, END
BEGIN NOW With what may be devised of honours new, END
BEGIN NOW Receive him coming to receive from us END
BEGIN NOW Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile! END
BEGIN NOW Too much to one! but double how endured, END
BEGIN NOW To one, and to his image now proclaimed? END
BEGIN NOW But what if better counsels might erect END
BEGIN NOW Our minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke? END
BEGIN NOW Will ye submit your necks, and choose to bend END
BEGIN NOW The supple knee? Ye will not, if I trust END
BEGIN NOW To know ye right, or if ye know yourselves END
BEGIN NOW Natives and sons of Heaven possessed before END
BEGIN NOW By none; and if not equal all, yet free, END
BEGIN NOW Equally free; for orders and degrees END
BEGIN NOW Jar not with liberty, but well consist. END
BEGIN NOW Who can in reason then, or right, assume END
BEGIN NOW Monarchy over such as live by right END
BEGIN NOW His equals, if in power and splendour less, END
BEGIN NOW In freedom equal? or can introduce END
BEGIN NOW Law and edict on us, who without law END
BEGIN NOW Err not? much less for this to be our Lord, END
BEGIN NOW And look for adoration, to the abuse END
BEGIN NOW Of those imperial titles, which assert END
BEGIN NOW Our being ordained to govern, not to serve. END
BEGIN NOW Thus far his bold discourse without controul END
BEGIN NOW Had audience; when among the Seraphim END
BEGIN NOW Abdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored END
BEGIN NOW The Deity, and divine commands obeyed, END
BEGIN NOW Stood up, and in a flame of zeal severe END
BEGIN NOW The current of his fury thus opposed. END
BEGIN NOW O argument blasphemous, false, and proud! END
BEGIN NOW Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Expected, least of all from thee, Ingrate, END
BEGIN NOW In place thyself so high above thy peers. END
BEGIN NOW Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn END
BEGIN NOW The just decree of God, pronounced and sworn, END
BEGIN NOW That to his only Son, by right endued END
BEGIN NOW With regal scepter, every soul in Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due END
BEGIN NOW Confess him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest, END
BEGIN NOW Flatly unjust, to bind with laws the free, END
BEGIN NOW And equal over equals to let reign, END
BEGIN NOW One over all with unsucceeded power. END
BEGIN NOW Shalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute END
BEGIN NOW With him the points of liberty, who made END
BEGIN NOW Thee what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being? END
BEGIN NOW Yet, by experience taught, we know how good, END
BEGIN NOW And of our good and of our dignity END
BEGIN NOW How provident he is; how far from thought END
BEGIN NOW To make us less, bent rather to exalt END
BEGIN NOW Our happy state, under one head more near END
BEGIN NOW United. But to grant it thee unjust, END
BEGIN NOW That equal over equals monarch reign: END
BEGIN NOW Thyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count, END
BEGIN NOW Or all angelick nature joined in one, END
BEGIN NOW Equal to him begotten Son? by whom, END
BEGIN NOW As by his Word, the Mighty Father made END
BEGIN NOW All things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW By him created in their bright degrees, END
BEGIN NOW Crowned them with glory, and to their glory named END
BEGIN NOW Essential Powers; nor by his reign obscured, END
BEGIN NOW But more illustrious made; since he the head END
BEGIN NOW One of our number thus reduced becomes; END
BEGIN NOW His laws our laws; all honour to him done END
BEGIN NOW Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage, END
BEGIN NOW And tempt not these; but hasten to appease END
BEGIN NOW The incensed Father, and the incensed Son, END
BEGIN NOW While pardon may be found in time besought. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal END
BEGIN NOW None seconded, as out of season judged, END
BEGIN NOW Or singular and rash: Whereat rejoiced END
BEGIN NOW The Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied. END
BEGIN NOW That we were formed then sayest thou? and the work END
BEGIN NOW Of secondary hands, by task transferred END
BEGIN NOW From Father to his Son? strange point and new! END
BEGIN NOW Doctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw END
BEGIN NOW When this creation was? rememberest thou END
BEGIN NOW Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being? END
BEGIN NOW We know no time when we were not as now; END
BEGIN NOW Know none before us, self-begot, self-raised END
BEGIN NOW By our own quickening power, when fatal course END
BEGIN NOW Had circled his full orb, the birth mature END
BEGIN NOW Of this our native Heaven, ethereal sons. END
BEGIN NOW Our puissance is our own; our own right hand END
BEGIN NOW Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try END
BEGIN NOW Who is our equal: Then thou shalt behold END
BEGIN NOW Whether by supplication we intend END
BEGIN NOW Address, and to begirt the almighty throne END
BEGIN NOW Beseeching or besieging. This report, END
BEGIN NOW These tidings carry to the anointed King; END
BEGIN NOW And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight. END
BEGIN NOW He said; and, as the sound of waters deep, END
BEGIN NOW Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause END
BEGIN NOW Through the infinite host; nor less for that END
BEGIN NOW The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone END
BEGIN NOW Encompassed round with foes, thus answered bold. END
BEGIN NOW O alienate from God, O Spirit accursed, END
BEGIN NOW Forsaken of all good! I see thy fall END
BEGIN NOW Determined, and thy hapless crew involved END
BEGIN NOW In this perfidious fraud, contagion spread END
BEGIN NOW Both of thy crime and punishment: Henceforth END
BEGIN NOW No more be troubled how to quit the yoke END
BEGIN NOW Of God's Messiah; those indulgent laws END
BEGIN NOW Will not be now vouchsafed; other decrees END
BEGIN NOW Against thee are gone forth without recall; END
BEGIN NOW That golden scepter, which thou didst reject, END
BEGIN NOW Is now an iron rod to bruise and break END
BEGIN NOW Thy disobedience. Well thou didst advise; END
BEGIN NOW Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly END
BEGIN NOW These wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath END
BEGIN NOW Impendent, raging into sudden flame, END
BEGIN NOW Distinguish not: For soon expect to feel END
BEGIN NOW His thunder on thy head, devouring fire. END
BEGIN NOW Then who created thee lamenting learn, END
BEGIN NOW When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found END
BEGIN NOW Among the faithless, faithful only he; END
BEGIN NOW Among innumerable false, unmoved, END
BEGIN NOW Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified, END
BEGIN NOW His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal; END
BEGIN NOW Nor number, nor example, with him wrought END
BEGIN NOW To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind, END
BEGIN NOW Though single. From amidst them forth he passed, END
BEGIN NOW Long way through hostile scorn, which he sustained END
BEGIN NOW Superiour, nor of violence feared aught; END
BEGIN NOW And, with retorted scorn, his back he turned END
BEGIN NOW On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed. END
BEGIN NOW All night the dreadless Angel, unpursued, END
BEGIN NOW Through Heaven's wide champain held his way; till Morn, END
BEGIN NOW Waked by the circling Hours, with rosy hand END
BEGIN NOW Unbarred the gates of light. There is a cave END
BEGIN NOW Within the mount of God, fast by his throne, END
BEGIN NOW Where light and darkness in perpetual round END
BEGIN NOW Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Grateful vicissitude, like day and night; END
BEGIN NOW Light issues forth, and at the other door END
BEGIN NOW Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour END
BEGIN NOW To veil the Heaven, though darkness there might well END
BEGIN NOW Seem twilight here: And now went forth the Morn END
BEGIN NOW Such as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold END
BEGIN NOW Empyreal; from before her vanished Night, END
BEGIN NOW Shot through with orient beams; when all the plain END
BEGIN NOW Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright, END
BEGIN NOW Chariots, and flaming arms, and fiery steeds, END
BEGIN NOW Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view: END
BEGIN NOW War he perceived, war in procinct; and found END
BEGIN NOW Already known what he for news had thought END
BEGIN NOW To have reported: Gladly then he mixed END
BEGIN NOW Among those friendly Powers, who him received END
BEGIN NOW With joy and acclamations loud, that one, END
BEGIN NOW That of so many myriads fallen, yet one END
BEGIN NOW Returned not lost. On to the sacred hill END
BEGIN NOW They led him high applauded, and present END
BEGIN NOW Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice, END
BEGIN NOW From midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard. END
BEGIN NOW Servant of God. Well done; well hast thou fought END
BEGIN NOW The better fight, who single hast maintained END
BEGIN NOW Against revolted multitudes the cause END
BEGIN NOW Of truth, in word mightier than they in arms; END
BEGIN NOW And for the testimony of truth hast borne END
BEGIN NOW Universal reproach, far worse to bear END
BEGIN NOW Than violence; for this was all thy care END
BEGIN NOW To stand approved in sight of God, though worlds END
BEGIN NOW Judged thee perverse: The easier conquest now END
BEGIN NOW Remains thee, aided by this host of friends, END
BEGIN NOW Back on thy foes more glorious to return, END
BEGIN NOW Than scorned thou didst depart; and to subdue END
BEGIN NOW By force, who reason for their law refuse, END
BEGIN NOW Right reason for their law, and for their King END
BEGIN NOW Messiah, who by right of merit reigns. END
BEGIN NOW Go, Michael, of celestial armies prince, END
BEGIN NOW And thou, in military prowess next, END
BEGIN NOW Gabriel, lead forth to battle these my sons END
BEGIN NOW Invincible; lead forth my armed Saints, END
BEGIN NOW By thousands and by millions, ranged for fight, END
BEGIN NOW Equal in number to that Godless crew END
BEGIN NOW Rebellious: Them with fire and hostile arms END
BEGIN NOW Fearless assault; and, to the brow of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Pursuing, drive them out from God and bliss, END
BEGIN NOW Into their place of punishment, the gulf END
BEGIN NOW Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide END
BEGIN NOW His fiery Chaos to receive their fall. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Sovran Voice, and clouds began END
BEGIN NOW To darken all the hill, and smoke to roll END
BEGIN NOW In dusky wreaths, reluctant flames, the sign END
BEGIN NOW Of wrath awaked; nor with less dread the loud END
BEGIN NOW Ethereal trumpet from on high 'gan blow: END
BEGIN NOW At which command the Powers militant, END
BEGIN NOW That stood for Heaven, in mighty quadrate joined END
BEGIN NOW Of union irresistible, moved on END
BEGIN NOW In silence their bright legions, to the sound END
BEGIN NOW Of instrumental harmony, that breathed END
BEGIN NOW Heroick ardour to adventurous deeds END
BEGIN NOW Under their God-like leaders, in the cause END
BEGIN NOW Of God and his Messiah. On they move END
BEGIN NOW Indissolubly firm; nor obvious hill, END
BEGIN NOW Nor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream, divides END
BEGIN NOW Their perfect ranks; for high above the ground END
BEGIN NOW Their march was, and the passive air upbore END
BEGIN NOW Their nimble tread; as when the total kind END
BEGIN NOW Of birds, in orderly array on wing, END
BEGIN NOW Came summoned over Eden to receive END
BEGIN NOW Their names of thee; so over many a tract END
BEGIN NOW Of Heaven they marched, and many a province wide, END
BEGIN NOW Tenfold the length of this terrene: At last, END
BEGIN NOW Far in the horizon to the north appeared END
BEGIN NOW From skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched END
BEGIN NOW In battailous aspect, and nearer view END
BEGIN NOW Bristled with upright beams innumerable END
BEGIN NOW Of rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields END
BEGIN NOW Various, with boastful argument portrayed, END
BEGIN NOW The banded Powers of Satan hasting on END
BEGIN NOW With furious expedition; for they weened END
BEGIN NOW That self-same day, by fight or by surprise, END
BEGIN NOW To win the mount of God, and on his throne END
BEGIN NOW To set the Envier of his state, the proud END
BEGIN NOW Aspirer; but their thoughts proved fond and vain END
BEGIN NOW In the mid way: Though strange to us it seemed END
BEGIN NOW At first, that Angel should with Angel war, END
BEGIN NOW And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet END
BEGIN NOW So oft in festivals of joy and love END
BEGIN NOW Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire, END
BEGIN NOW Hymning the Eternal Father: But the shout END
BEGIN NOW Of battle now began, and rushing sound END
BEGIN NOW Of onset ended soon each milder thought. END
BEGIN NOW High in the midst, exalted as a God, END
BEGIN NOW The Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat, END
BEGIN NOW Idol of majesty divine, enclosed END
BEGIN NOW With flaming Cherubim, and golden shields; END
BEGIN NOW Then lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now END
BEGIN NOW 'Twixt host and host but narrow space was left, END
BEGIN NOW A dreadful interval, and front to front END
BEGIN NOW Presented stood in terrible array END
BEGIN NOW Of hideous length: Before the cloudy van, END
BEGIN NOW On the rough edge of battle ere it joined, END
BEGIN NOW Satan, with vast and haughty strides advanced, END
BEGIN NOW Came towering, armed in adamant and gold; END
BEGIN NOW Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stood END
BEGIN NOW Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds, END
BEGIN NOW And thus his own undaunted heart explores. END
BEGIN NOW O Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest END
BEGIN NOW Should yet remain, where faith and realty END
BEGIN NOW Remain not: Wherefore should not strength and might END
BEGIN NOW There fail where virtue fails, or weakest prove END
BEGIN NOW Where boldest, though to fight unconquerable? END
BEGIN NOW His puissance, trusting in the Almighty's aid, END
BEGIN NOW I mean to try, whose reason I have tried END
BEGIN NOW Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just, END
BEGIN NOW That he, who in debate of truth hath won, END
BEGIN NOW Should win in arms, in both disputes alike END
BEGIN NOW Victor; though brutish that contest and foul, END
BEGIN NOW When reason hath to deal with force, yet so END
BEGIN NOW Most reason is that reason overcome. END
BEGIN NOW So pondering, and from his armed peers END
BEGIN NOW Forth stepping opposite, half-way he met END
BEGIN NOW His daring foe, at this prevention more END
BEGIN NOW Incensed, and thus securely him defied. END
BEGIN NOW Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reached END
BEGIN NOW The highth of thy aspiring unopposed, END
BEGIN NOW The throne of God unguarded, and his side END
BEGIN NOW Abandoned, at the terrour of thy power END
BEGIN NOW Or potent tongue: Fool! not to think how vain END
BEGIN NOW Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms; END
BEGIN NOW Who out of smallest things could, without end, END
BEGIN NOW Have raised incessant armies to defeat END
BEGIN NOW Thy folly; or with solitary hand END
BEGIN NOW Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow, END
BEGIN NOW Unaided, could have finished thee, and whelmed END
BEGIN NOW Thy legions under darkness: But thou seest END
BEGIN NOW All are not of thy train; there be, who faith END
BEGIN NOW Prefer, and piety to God, though then END
BEGIN NOW To thee not visible, when I alone END
BEGIN NOW Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent END
BEGIN NOW From all: My sect thou seest; now learn too late END
BEGIN NOW How few sometimes may know, when thousands err. END
BEGIN NOW Whom the grand foe, with scornful eye askance, END
BEGIN NOW Thus answered. Ill for thee, but in wished hour END
BEGIN NOW Of my revenge, first sought for, thou returnest END
BEGIN NOW From flight, seditious Angel! to receive END
BEGIN NOW Thy merited reward, the first assay END
BEGIN NOW Of this right hand provoked, since first that tongue, END
BEGIN NOW Inspired with contradiction, durst oppose END
BEGIN NOW A third part of the Gods, in synod met END
BEGIN NOW Their deities to assert; who, while they feel END
BEGIN NOW Vigour divine within them, can allow END
BEGIN NOW Omnipotence to none. But well thou comest END
BEGIN NOW Before thy fellows, ambitious to win END
BEGIN NOW From me some plume, that thy success may show END
BEGIN NOW Destruction to the rest: This pause between, END
BEGIN NOW (Unanswered lest thou boast) to let thee know, END
BEGIN NOW At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven END
BEGIN NOW To heavenly souls had been all one; but now END
BEGIN NOW I see that most through sloth had rather serve, END
BEGIN NOW Ministring Spirits, trained up in feast and song! END
BEGIN NOW Such hast thou armed, the minstrelsy of Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Servility with freedom to contend, END
BEGIN NOW As both their deeds compared this day shall prove. END
BEGIN NOW To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied. END
BEGIN NOW Apostate! still thou errest, nor end wilt find END
BEGIN NOW Of erring, from the path of truth remote: END
BEGIN NOW Unjustly thou depravest it with the name END
BEGIN NOW Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains, END
BEGIN NOW Or Nature: God and Nature bid the same, END
BEGIN NOW When he who rules is worthiest, and excels END
BEGIN NOW Them whom he governs. This is servitude, END
BEGIN NOW To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled END
BEGIN NOW Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee, END
BEGIN NOW Thyself not free, but to thyself enthralled; END
BEGIN NOW Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid. END
BEGIN NOW Reign thou in Hell, thy kingdom; let me serve END
BEGIN NOW In Heaven God ever blest, and his divine END
BEGIN NOW Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyed; END
BEGIN NOW Yet chains in Hell, not realms, expect: Mean while END
BEGIN NOW From me returned, as erst thou saidst, from flight, END
BEGIN NOW This greeting on thy impious crest receive. END
BEGIN NOW So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high, END
BEGIN NOW Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell END
BEGIN NOW On the proud crest of Satan, that no sight, END
BEGIN NOW Nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield, END
BEGIN NOW Such ruin intercept: Ten paces huge END
BEGIN NOW He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee END
BEGIN NOW His massy spear upstaid; as if on earth END
BEGIN NOW Winds under ground, or waters forcing way, END
BEGIN NOW Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat, END
BEGIN NOW Half sunk with all his pines. Amazement seised END
BEGIN NOW The rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see END
BEGIN NOW Thus foiled their mightiest; ours joy filled, and shout, END
BEGIN NOW Presage of victory, and fierce desire END
BEGIN NOW Of battle: Whereat Michael bid sound END
BEGIN NOW The Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW It sounded, and the faithful armies rung END
BEGIN NOW Hosanna to the Highest: Nor stood at gaze END
BEGIN NOW The adverse legions, nor less hideous joined END
BEGIN NOW The horrid shock. Now storming fury rose, END
BEGIN NOW And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now END
BEGIN NOW Was never; arms on armour clashing brayed END
BEGIN NOW Horrible discord, and the madding wheels END
BEGIN NOW Of brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise END
BEGIN NOW Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss END
BEGIN NOW Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew, END
BEGIN NOW And flying vaulted either host with fire. END
BEGIN NOW So under fiery cope together rushed END
BEGIN NOW Both battles main, with ruinous assault END
BEGIN NOW And inextinguishable rage. All Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Resounded; and had Earth been then, all Earth END
BEGIN NOW Had to her center shook. What wonder? when END
BEGIN NOW Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought END
BEGIN NOW On either side, the least of whom could wield END
BEGIN NOW These elements, and arm him with the force END
BEGIN NOW Of all their regions: How much more of power END
BEGIN NOW Army against army numberless to raise END
BEGIN NOW Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb, END
BEGIN NOW Though not destroy, their happy native seat; END
BEGIN NOW From his strong hold of Heaven, high over-ruled END
BEGIN NOW And limited their might; though numbered such END
BEGIN NOW As each divided legion might have seemed END
BEGIN NOW A numerous host; in strength each armed hand END
BEGIN NOW A legion; led in fight, yet leader seemed END
BEGIN NOW Each warriour single as in chief, expert END
BEGIN NOW When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway END
BEGIN NOW Of battle, open when, and when to close END
BEGIN NOW The ridges of grim war: No thought of flight, END
BEGIN NOW None of retreat, no unbecoming deed END
BEGIN NOW That argued fear; each on himself relied, END
BEGIN NOW As only in his arm the moment lay END
BEGIN NOW Of victory: Deeds of eternal fame END
BEGIN NOW Were done, but infinite; for wide was spread END
BEGIN NOW That war and various; sometimes on firm ground END
BEGIN NOW A standing fight, then, soaring on main wing, END
BEGIN NOW Tormented all the air; all air seemed then END
BEGIN NOW Conflicting fire. Long time in even scale END
BEGIN NOW The battle hung; till Satan, who that day END
BEGIN NOW Prodigious power had shown, and met in arms END
BEGIN NOW No equal, ranging through the dire attack END
BEGIN NOW Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length END
BEGIN NOW Saw where the sword of Michael smote, and felled END
BEGIN NOW Squadrons at once; with huge two-handed sway END
BEGIN NOW Brandished aloft, the horrid edge came down END
BEGIN NOW Wide-wasting; such destruction to withstand END
BEGIN NOW He hasted, and opposed the rocky orb END
BEGIN NOW Of tenfold adamant, his ample shield, END
BEGIN NOW A vast circumference. At his approach END
BEGIN NOW The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil END
BEGIN NOW Surceased, and glad, as hoping here to end END
BEGIN NOW Intestine war in Heaven, the arch-foe subdued END
BEGIN NOW Or captive dragged in chains, with hostile frown END
BEGIN NOW And visage all inflamed first thus began. END
BEGIN NOW Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt, END
BEGIN NOW Unnamed in Heaven, now plenteous as thou seest END
BEGIN NOW These acts of hateful strife, hateful to all, END
BEGIN NOW Though heaviest by just measure on thyself, END
BEGIN NOW And thy adherents: How hast thou disturbed END
BEGIN NOW Heaven's blessed peace, and into nature brought END
BEGIN NOW Misery, uncreated till the crime END
BEGIN NOW Of thy rebellion! how hast thou instilled END
BEGIN NOW Thy malice into thousands, once upright END
BEGIN NOW And faithful, now proved false! But think not here END
BEGIN NOW To trouble holy rest; Heaven casts thee out END
BEGIN NOW From all her confines. Heaven, the seat of bliss, END
BEGIN NOW Brooks not the works of violence and war. END
BEGIN NOW Hence then, and evil go with thee along, END
BEGIN NOW Thy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell; END
BEGIN NOW Thou and thy wicked crew! there mingle broils, END
BEGIN NOW Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom, END
BEGIN NOW Or some more sudden vengeance, winged from God, END
BEGIN NOW Precipitate thee with augmented pain. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus END
BEGIN NOW The Adversary. Nor think thou with wind END
BEGIN NOW Of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds END
BEGIN NOW Thou canst not. Hast thou turned the least of these END
BEGIN NOW To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise END
BEGIN NOW Unvanquished, easier to transact with me END
BEGIN NOW That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats END
BEGIN NOW To chase me hence? err not, that so shall end END
BEGIN NOW The strife which thou callest evil, but we style END
BEGIN NOW The strife of glory; which we mean to win, END
BEGIN NOW Or turn this Heaven itself into the Hell END
BEGIN NOW Thou fablest; here however to dwell free, END
BEGIN NOW If not to reign: Mean while thy utmost force, END
BEGIN NOW And join him named Almighty to thy aid, END
BEGIN NOW I fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh. END
BEGIN NOW They ended parle, and both addressed for fight END
BEGIN NOW Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue END
BEGIN NOW Of Angels, can relate, or to what things END
BEGIN NOW Liken on earth conspicuous, that may lift END
BEGIN NOW Human imagination to such highth END
BEGIN NOW Of Godlike power? for likest Gods they seemed, END
BEGIN NOW Stood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms, END
BEGIN NOW Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Now waved their fiery swords, and in the air END
BEGIN NOW Made horrid circles; two broad suns their shields END
BEGIN NOW Blazed opposite, while Expectation stood END
BEGIN NOW In horrour: From each hand with speed retired, END
BEGIN NOW Where erst was thickest fight, the angelick throng, END
BEGIN NOW And left large field, unsafe within the wind END
BEGIN NOW Of such commotion; such as, to set forth END
BEGIN NOW Great things by small, if, nature's concord broke, END
BEGIN NOW Among the constellations war were sprung, END
BEGIN NOW Two planets, rushing from aspect malign END
BEGIN NOW Of fiercest opposition, in mid sky END
BEGIN NOW Should combat, and their jarring spheres confound. END
BEGIN NOW Together both with next to almighty arm END
BEGIN NOW Up-lifted imminent, one stroke they aimed END
BEGIN NOW That might determine, and not need repeat, END
BEGIN NOW As not of power at once; nor odds appeared END
BEGIN NOW In might or swift prevention: But the sword END
BEGIN NOW Of Michael from the armoury of God END
BEGIN NOW Was given him tempered so, that neither keen END
BEGIN NOW Nor solid might resist that edge: it met END
BEGIN NOW The sword of Satan, with steep force to smite END
BEGIN NOW Descending, and in half cut sheer; nor staid, END
BEGIN NOW But with swift wheel reverse, deep entering, shared END
BEGIN NOW All his right side: Then Satan first knew pain, END
BEGIN NOW And writhed him to and fro convolved; so sore END
BEGIN NOW The griding sword with discontinuous wound END
BEGIN NOW Passed through him: But the ethereal substance closed, END
BEGIN NOW Not long divisible; and from the gash END
BEGIN NOW A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed END
BEGIN NOW Sanguine, such as celestial Spirits may bleed, END
BEGIN NOW And all his armour stained, ere while so bright. END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run END
BEGIN NOW By Angels many and strong, who interposed END
BEGIN NOW Defence, while others bore him on their shields END
BEGIN NOW Back to his chariot, where it stood retired END
BEGIN NOW From off the files of war: There they him laid END
BEGIN NOW Gnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame, END
BEGIN NOW To find himself not matchless, and his pride END
BEGIN NOW Humbled by such rebuke, so far beneath END
BEGIN NOW His confidence to equal God in power. END
BEGIN NOW Yet soon he healed; for Spirits that live throughout END
BEGIN NOW Vital in every part, not as frail man END
BEGIN NOW In entrails, heart of head, liver or reins, END
BEGIN NOW Cannot but by annihilating die; END
BEGIN NOW Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound END
BEGIN NOW Receive, no more than can the fluid air: END
BEGIN NOW All heart they live, all head, all eye, all ear, END
BEGIN NOW All intellect, all sense; and, as they please, END
BEGIN NOW They limb themselves, and colour, shape, or size END
BEGIN NOW Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare. END
BEGIN NOW Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved END
BEGIN NOW Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought, END
BEGIN NOW And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array END
BEGIN NOW Of Moloch, furious king; who him defied, END
BEGIN NOW And at his chariot-wheels to drag him bound END
BEGIN NOW Threatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Refrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon END
BEGIN NOW Down cloven to the waist, with shattered arms END
BEGIN NOW And uncouth pain fled bellowing. On each wing END
BEGIN NOW Uriel, and Raphael, his vaunting foe, END
BEGIN NOW Though huge, and in a rock of diamond armed, END
BEGIN NOW Two potent Thrones, that to be less than Gods END
BEGIN NOW Disdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight, END
BEGIN NOW Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail. END
BEGIN NOW Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy END
BEGIN NOW The atheist crew, but with redoubled blow END
BEGIN NOW Ariel, and Arioch, and the violence END
BEGIN NOW Of Ramiel scorched and blasted, overthrew. END
BEGIN NOW I might relate of thousands, and their names END
BEGIN NOW Eternize here on earth; but those elect END
BEGIN NOW Angels, contented with their fame in Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Seek not the praise of men: The other sort, END
BEGIN NOW In might though wonderous and in acts of war, END
BEGIN NOW Nor of renown less eager, yet by doom END
BEGIN NOW Cancelled from Heaven and sacred memory, END
BEGIN NOW Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell. END
BEGIN NOW For strength from truth divided, and from just, END
BEGIN NOW Illaudable, nought merits but dispraise END
BEGIN NOW And ignominy; yet to glory aspires END
BEGIN NOW Vain-glorious, and through infamy seeks fame: END
BEGIN NOW Therefore eternal silence be their doom. END
BEGIN NOW And now, their mightiest quelled, the battle swerved, END
BEGIN NOW With many an inroad gored; deformed rout END
BEGIN NOW Entered, and foul disorder; all the ground END
BEGIN NOW With shivered armour strown, and on a heap END
BEGIN NOW Chariot and charioteer lay overturned, END
BEGIN NOW And fiery-foaming steeds; what stood, recoiled END
BEGIN NOW O'er-wearied, through the faint Satanick host END
BEGIN NOW Defensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised, END
BEGIN NOW Then first with fear surprised, and sense of pain, END
BEGIN NOW Fled ignominious, to such evil brought END
BEGIN NOW By sin of disobedience; till that hour END
BEGIN NOW Not liable to fear, or flight, or pain. END
BEGIN NOW Far otherwise the inviolable Saints, END
BEGIN NOW In cubick phalanx firm, advanced entire, END
BEGIN NOW Invulnerable, impenetrably armed; END
BEGIN NOW Such high advantages their innocence END
BEGIN NOW Gave them above their foes; not to have sinned, END
BEGIN NOW Not to have disobeyed; in fight they stood END
BEGIN NOW Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pained END
BEGIN NOW By wound, though from their place by violence moved, END
BEGIN NOW Now Night her course began, and, over Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Inducing darkness, grateful truce imposed, END
BEGIN NOW And silence on the odious din of war: END
BEGIN NOW Under her cloudy covert both retired, END
BEGIN NOW Victor and vanquished: On the foughten field END
BEGIN NOW Michael and his Angels prevalent END
BEGIN NOW Encamping, placed in guard their watches round, END
BEGIN NOW Cherubick waving fires: On the other part, END
BEGIN NOW Satan with his rebellious disappeared, END
BEGIN NOW Far in the dark dislodged; and, void of rest, END
BEGIN NOW His potentates to council called by night; END
BEGIN NOW And in the midst thus undismayed began. END
BEGIN NOW O now in danger tried, now known in arms END
BEGIN NOW Not to be overpowered, Companions dear, END
BEGIN NOW Found worthy not of liberty alone, END
BEGIN NOW Too mean pretence! but what we more affect, END
BEGIN NOW Honour, dominion, glory, and renown; END
BEGIN NOW Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight, END
BEGIN NOW (And if one day, why not eternal days?) END
BEGIN NOW What Heaven's Lord had powerfullest to send END
BEGIN NOW Against us from about his throne, and judged END
BEGIN NOW Sufficient to subdue us to his will, END
BEGIN NOW But proves not so: Then fallible, it seems, END
BEGIN NOW Of future we may deem him, though till now END
BEGIN NOW Omniscient thought. True is, less firmly armed, END
BEGIN NOW Some disadvantage we endured and pain, END
BEGIN NOW Till now not known, but, known, as soon contemned; END
BEGIN NOW Since now we find this our empyreal form END
BEGIN NOW Incapable of mortal injury, END
BEGIN NOW Imperishable, and, though pierced with wound, END
BEGIN NOW Soon closing, and by native vigour healed. END
BEGIN NOW Of evil then so small as easy think END
BEGIN NOW The remedy; perhaps more valid arms, END
BEGIN NOW Weapons more violent, when next we meet, END
BEGIN NOW May serve to better us, and worse our foes, END
BEGIN NOW Or equal what between us made the odds, END
BEGIN NOW In nature none: If other hidden cause END
BEGIN NOW Left them superiour, while we can preserve END
BEGIN NOW Unhurt our minds, and understanding sound, END
BEGIN NOW Due search and consultation will disclose. END
BEGIN NOW He sat; and in the assembly next upstood END
BEGIN NOW Nisroch, of Principalities the prime; END
BEGIN NOW As one he stood escaped from cruel fight, END
BEGIN NOW Sore toiled, his riven arms to havock hewn, END
BEGIN NOW And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake. END
BEGIN NOW Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free END
BEGIN NOW Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard END
BEGIN NOW For Gods, and too unequal work we find, END
BEGIN NOW Against unequal arms to fight in pain, END
BEGIN NOW Against unpained, impassive; from which evil END
BEGIN NOW Ruin must needs ensue; for what avails END
BEGIN NOW Valour or strength, though matchless, quelled with pain END
BEGIN NOW Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands END
BEGIN NOW Of mightiest? Sense of pleasure we may well END
BEGIN NOW Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine, END
BEGIN NOW But live content, which is the calmest life: END
BEGIN NOW But pain is perfect misery, the worst END
BEGIN NOW Of evils, and, excessive, overturns END
BEGIN NOW All patience. He, who therefore can invent END
BEGIN NOW With what more forcible we may offend END
BEGIN NOW Our yet unwounded enemies, or arm END
BEGIN NOW Ourselves with like defence, to me deserves END
BEGIN NOW No less than for deliverance what we owe. END
BEGIN NOW Whereto with look composed Satan replied. END
BEGIN NOW Not uninvented that, which thou aright END
BEGIN NOW Believest so main to our success, I bring. END
BEGIN NOW Which of us who beholds the bright surface END
BEGIN NOW Of this ethereous mould whereon we stand, END
BEGIN NOW This continent of spacious Heaven, adorned END
BEGIN NOW With plant, fruit, flower ambrosial, gems, and gold; END
BEGIN NOW Whose eye so superficially surveys END
BEGIN NOW These things, as not to mind from whence they grow END
BEGIN NOW Deep under ground, materials dark and crude, END
BEGIN NOW Of spiritous and fiery spume, till touched END
BEGIN NOW With Heaven's ray, and tempered, they shoot forth END
BEGIN NOW So beauteous, opening to the ambient light? END
BEGIN NOW These in their dark nativity the deep END
BEGIN NOW Shall yield us, pregnant with infernal flame; END
BEGIN NOW Which, into hollow engines, long and round, END
BEGIN NOW Thick rammed, at the other bore with touch of fire END
BEGIN NOW Dilated and infuriate, shall send forth END
BEGIN NOW From far, with thundering noise, among our foes END
BEGIN NOW Such implements of mischief, as shall dash END
BEGIN NOW To pieces, and o'erwhelm whatever stands END
BEGIN NOW Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmed END
BEGIN NOW The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. END
BEGIN NOW Nor long shall be our labour; yet ere dawn, END
BEGIN NOW Effect shall end our wish. Mean while revive; END
BEGIN NOW Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joined END
BEGIN NOW Think nothing hard, much less to be despaired. END
BEGIN NOW He ended, and his words their drooping cheer END
BEGIN NOW Enlightened, and their languished hope revived. END
BEGIN NOW The invention all admired, and each, how he END
BEGIN NOW To be the inventer missed; so easy it seemed END
BEGIN NOW Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought END
BEGIN NOW Impossible: Yet, haply, of thy race END
BEGIN NOW In future days, if malice should abound, END
BEGIN NOW Some one intent on mischief, or inspired END
BEGIN NOW With devilish machination, might devise END
BEGIN NOW Like instrument to plague the sons of men END
BEGIN NOW For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent. END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith from council to the work they flew; END
BEGIN NOW None arguing stood; innumerable hands END
BEGIN NOW Were ready; in a moment up they turned END
BEGIN NOW Wide the celestial soil, and saw beneath END
BEGIN NOW The originals of nature in their crude END
BEGIN NOW Conception; sulphurous and nitrous foam END
BEGIN NOW They found, they mingled, and, with subtle art, END
BEGIN NOW Concocted and adusted they reduced END
BEGIN NOW To blackest grain, and into store conveyed: END
BEGIN NOW Part hidden veins digged up (nor hath this earth END
BEGIN NOW Entrails unlike) of mineral and stone, END
BEGIN NOW Whereof to found their engines and their balls END
BEGIN NOW Of missive ruin; part incentive reed END
BEGIN NOW Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire. END
BEGIN NOW So all ere day-spring, under conscious night, END
BEGIN NOW Secret they finished, and in order set, END
BEGIN NOW With silent circumspection, unespied. END
BEGIN NOW Now when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared, END
BEGIN NOW Up rose the victor-Angels, and to arms END
BEGIN NOW The matin trumpet sung: In arms they stood END
BEGIN NOW Of golden panoply, refulgent host, END
BEGIN NOW Soon banded; others from the dawning hills END
BEGIN NOW Look round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour, END
BEGIN NOW Each quarter to descry the distant foe, END
BEGIN NOW Where lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight, END
BEGIN NOW In motion or in halt: Him soon they met END
BEGIN NOW Under spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow END
BEGIN NOW But firm battalion; back with speediest sail END
BEGIN NOW Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing, END
BEGIN NOW Came flying, and in mid air aloud thus cried. END
BEGIN NOW Arm, Warriours, arm for fight; the foe at hand, END
BEGIN NOW Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit END
BEGIN NOW This day; fear not his flight; so thick a cloud END
BEGIN NOW He comes, and settled in his face I see END
BEGIN NOW Sad resolution, and secure: Let each END
BEGIN NOW His adamantine coat gird well, and each END
BEGIN NOW Fit well his helm, gripe fast his orbed shield, END
BEGIN NOW Borne even or high; for this day will pour down, END
BEGIN NOW If I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower, END
BEGIN NOW But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire. END
BEGIN NOW So warned he them, aware themselves, and soon END
BEGIN NOW In order, quit of all impediment; END
BEGIN NOW Instant without disturb they took alarm, END
BEGIN NOW And onward moved embattled: When behold! END
BEGIN NOW Not distant far with heavy pace the foe END
BEGIN NOW Approaching gross and huge, in hollow cube END
BEGIN NOW Training his devilish enginery, impaled END
BEGIN NOW On every side with shadowing squadrons deep, END
BEGIN NOW To hide the fraud. At interview both stood END
BEGIN NOW A while; but suddenly at head appeared END
BEGIN NOW Satan, and thus was heard commanding loud. END
BEGIN NOW Vanguard, to right and left the front unfold; END
BEGIN NOW That all may see who hate us, how we seek END
BEGIN NOW Peace and composure, and with open breast END
BEGIN NOW Stand ready to receive them, if they like END
BEGIN NOW Our overture; and turn not back perverse: END
BEGIN NOW But that I doubt; however witness, Heaven! END
BEGIN NOW Heaven, witness thou anon! while we discharge END
BEGIN NOW Freely our part: ye, who appointed stand END
BEGIN NOW Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch END
BEGIN NOW What we propound, and loud that all may hear! END
BEGIN NOW So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce END
BEGIN NOW Had ended; when to right and left the front END
BEGIN NOW Divided, and to either flank retired: END
BEGIN NOW Which to our eyes discovered, new and strange, END
BEGIN NOW A triple mounted row of pillars laid END
BEGIN NOW On wheels (for like to pillars most they seemed, END
BEGIN NOW Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir, END
BEGIN NOW With branches lopt, in wood or mountain felled,) END
BEGIN NOW Brass, iron, stony mould, had not their mouths END
BEGIN NOW With hideous orifice gaped on us wide, END
BEGIN NOW Portending hollow truce: At each behind END
BEGIN NOW A Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed END
BEGIN NOW Stood waving tipt with fire; while we, suspense, END
BEGIN NOW Collected stood within our thoughts amused, END
BEGIN NOW Not long; for sudden all at once their reeds END
BEGIN NOW Put forth, and to a narrow vent applied END
BEGIN NOW With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame, END
BEGIN NOW But soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared, END
BEGIN NOW From those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar END
BEGIN NOW Embowelled with outrageous noise the air, END
BEGIN NOW And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul END
BEGIN NOW Their devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail END
BEGIN NOW Of iron globes; which, on the victor host END
BEGIN NOW Levelled, with such impetuous fury smote, END
BEGIN NOW That, whom they hit, none on their feet might stand, END
BEGIN NOW Though standing else as rocks, but down they fell END
BEGIN NOW By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rolled; END
BEGIN NOW The sooner for their arms; unarmed, they might END
BEGIN NOW Have easily, as Spirits, evaded swift END
BEGIN NOW By quick contraction or remove; but now END
BEGIN NOW Foul dissipation followed, and forced rout; END
BEGIN NOW Nor served it to relax their serried files. END
BEGIN NOW What should they do? if on they rushed, repulse END
BEGIN NOW Repeated, and indecent overthrow END
BEGIN NOW Doubled, would render them yet more despised, END
BEGIN NOW And to their foes a laughter; for in view END
BEGIN NOW Stood ranked of Seraphim another row, END
BEGIN NOW In posture to displode their second tire END
BEGIN NOW Of thunder: Back defeated to return END
BEGIN NOW They worse abhorred. Satan beheld their plight, END
BEGIN NOW And to his mates thus in derision called. END
BEGIN NOW O Friends! why come not on these victors proud END
BEGIN NOW Ere while they fierce were coming; and when we, END
BEGIN NOW To entertain them fair with open front END
BEGIN NOW And breast, (what could we more?) propounded terms END
BEGIN NOW Of composition, straight they changed their minds, END
BEGIN NOW Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, END
BEGIN NOW As they would dance; yet for a dance they seemed END
BEGIN NOW Somewhat extravagant and wild; perhaps END
BEGIN NOW For joy of offered peace: But I suppose, END
BEGIN NOW If our proposals once again were heard, END
BEGIN NOW We should compel them to a quick result. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood. END
BEGIN NOW Leader! the terms we sent were terms of weight, END
BEGIN NOW Of hard contents, and full of force urged home; END
BEGIN NOW Such as we might perceive amused them all, END
BEGIN NOW And stumbled many: Who receives them right, END
BEGIN NOW Had need from head to foot well understand; END
BEGIN NOW Not understood, this gift they have besides, END
BEGIN NOW They show us when our foes walk not upright. END
BEGIN NOW So they among themselves in pleasant vein END
BEGIN NOW Stood scoffing, hightened in their thoughts beyond END
BEGIN NOW All doubt of victory: Eternal Might END
BEGIN NOW To match with their inventions they presumed END
BEGIN NOW So easy, and of his thunder made a scorn, END
BEGIN NOW And all his host derided, while they stood END
BEGIN NOW A while in trouble: But they stood not long; END
BEGIN NOW Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms END
BEGIN NOW Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power, END
BEGIN NOW Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!) END
BEGIN NOW Their arms away they threw, and to the hills END
BEGIN NOW (For Earth hath this variety from Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Of pleasure situate in hill and dale,) END
BEGIN NOW Light as the lightning glimpse they ran, they flew; END
BEGIN NOW From their foundations loosening to and fro, END
BEGIN NOW They plucked the seated hills, with all their load, END
BEGIN NOW Rocks, waters, woods, and by the shaggy tops END
BEGIN NOW Up-lifting bore them in their hands: Amaze, END
BEGIN NOW Be sure, and terrour, seized the rebel host, END
BEGIN NOW When coming towards them so dread they saw END
BEGIN NOW The bottom of the mountains upward turned; END
BEGIN NOW Till on those cursed engines' triple-row END
BEGIN NOW They saw them whelmed, and all their confidence END
BEGIN NOW Under the weight of mountains buried deep; END
BEGIN NOW Themselves invaded next, and on their heads END
BEGIN NOW Main promontories flung, which in the air END
BEGIN NOW Came shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed; END
BEGIN NOW Their armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised END
BEGIN NOW Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain END
BEGIN NOW Implacable, and many a dolorous groan; END
BEGIN NOW Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind END
BEGIN NOW Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, END
BEGIN NOW Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. END
BEGIN NOW The rest, in imitation, to like arms END
BEGIN NOW Betook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore: END
BEGIN NOW So hills amid the air encountered hills, END
BEGIN NOW Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire; END
BEGIN NOW That under ground they fought in dismal shade; END
BEGIN NOW Infernal noise! war seemed a civil game END
BEGIN NOW To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped END
BEGIN NOW Upon confusion rose: And now all Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspread; END
BEGIN NOW Had not the Almighty Father, where he sits END
BEGIN NOW Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure, END
BEGIN NOW Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen END
BEGIN NOW This tumult, and permitted all, advised: END
BEGIN NOW That his great purpose he might so fulfil, END
BEGIN NOW To honour his anointed Son avenged END
BEGIN NOW Upon his enemies, and to declare END
BEGIN NOW All power on him transferred: Whence to his Son, END
BEGIN NOW The Assessour of his throne, he thus began. END
BEGIN NOW Effulgence of my glory, Son beloved, END
BEGIN NOW Son, in whose face invisible is beheld END
BEGIN NOW Visibly, what by Deity I am; END
BEGIN NOW And in whose hand what by decree I do, END
BEGIN NOW Second Omnipotence! two days are past, END
BEGIN NOW Two days, as we compute the days of Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame END
BEGIN NOW These disobedient: Sore hath been their fight, END
BEGIN NOW As likeliest was, when two such foes met armed; END
BEGIN NOW For to themselves I left them; and thou knowest, END
BEGIN NOW Equal in their creation they were formed, END
BEGIN NOW Save what sin hath impaired; which yet hath wrought END
BEGIN NOW Insensibly, for I suspend their doom; END
BEGIN NOW Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last END
BEGIN NOW Endless, and no solution will be found: END
BEGIN NOW War wearied hath performed what war can do, END
BEGIN NOW And to disordered rage let loose the reins END
BEGIN NOW With mountains, as with weapons, armed; which makes END
BEGIN NOW Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main. END
BEGIN NOW Two days are therefore past, the third is thine; END
BEGIN NOW For thee I have ordained it; and thus far END
BEGIN NOW Have suffered, that the glory may be thine END
BEGIN NOW Of ending this great war, since none but Thou END
BEGIN NOW Can end it. Into thee such virtue and grace END
BEGIN NOW Immense I have transfused, that all may know END
BEGIN NOW In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare; END
BEGIN NOW And, this perverse commotion governed thus, END
BEGIN NOW To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir END
BEGIN NOW Of all things; to be Heir, and to be King END
BEGIN NOW By sacred unction, thy deserved right. END
BEGIN NOW Go then, Thou Mightiest, in thy Father's might; END
BEGIN NOW Ascend my chariot, guide the rapid wheels END
BEGIN NOW That shake Heaven's basis, bring forth all my war, END
BEGIN NOW My bow and thunder, my almighty arms END
BEGIN NOW Gird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh; END
BEGIN NOW Pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out END
BEGIN NOW From all Heaven's bounds into the utter deep: END
BEGIN NOW There let them learn, as likes them, to despise END
BEGIN NOW God, and Messiah his anointed King. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and on his Son with rays direct END
BEGIN NOW Shone full; he all his Father full expressed END
BEGIN NOW Ineffably into his face received; END
BEGIN NOW And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake. END
BEGIN NOW O Father, O Supreme of heavenly Thrones, END
BEGIN NOW First, Highest, Holiest, Best; thou always seek'st END
BEGIN NOW To glorify thy Son, I always thee, END
BEGIN NOW As is most just: This I my glory account, END
BEGIN NOW My exaltation, and my whole delight, END
BEGIN NOW That thou, in me well pleased, declarest thy will END
BEGIN NOW Fulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss. END
BEGIN NOW Scepter and power, thy giving, I assume, END
BEGIN NOW And gladlier shall resign, when in the end END
BEGIN NOW Thou shalt be all in all, and I in thee END
BEGIN NOW For ever; and in me all whom thou lovest: END
BEGIN NOW But whom thou hatest, I hate, and can put on END
BEGIN NOW Thy terrours, as I put thy mildness on, END
BEGIN NOW Image of thee in all things; and shall soon, END
BEGIN NOW Armed with thy might, rid Heaven of these rebelled; END
BEGIN NOW To their prepared ill mansion driven down, END
BEGIN NOW To chains of darkness, and the undying worm; END
BEGIN NOW That from thy just obedience could revolt, END
BEGIN NOW Whom to obey is happiness entire. END
BEGIN NOW Then shall thy Saints unmixed, and from the impure END
BEGIN NOW Far separate, circling thy holy mount, END
BEGIN NOW Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing, END
BEGIN NOW Hymns of high praise, and I among them Chief. END
BEGIN NOW So said, he, o'er his scepter bowing, rose END
BEGIN NOW From the right hand of Glory where he sat; END
BEGIN NOW And the third sacred morn began to shine, END
BEGIN NOW Dawning through Heaven. Forth rushed with whirlwind sound END
BEGIN NOW The chariot of Paternal Deity, END
BEGIN NOW Flashing thick flames, wheel within wheel undrawn, END
BEGIN NOW Itself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed END
BEGIN NOW By four Cherubick shapes; four faces each END
BEGIN NOW Had wonderous; as with stars, their bodies all END
BEGIN NOW And wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels END
BEGIN NOW Of beryl, and careering fires between; END
BEGIN NOW Over their heads a crystal firmament, END
BEGIN NOW Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure END
BEGIN NOW Amber, and colours of the showery arch. END
BEGIN NOW He, in celestial panoply all armed END
BEGIN NOW Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, END
BEGIN NOW Ascended; at his right hand Victory END
BEGIN NOW Sat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow END
BEGIN NOW And quiver with three-bolted thunder stored; END
BEGIN NOW And from about him fierce effusion rolled END
BEGIN NOW Of smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire: END
BEGIN NOW Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, END
BEGIN NOW He onward came; far off his coming shone; END
BEGIN NOW And twenty thousand (I their number heard) END
BEGIN NOW Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen; END
BEGIN NOW He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime END
BEGIN NOW On the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned, END
BEGIN NOW Illustrious far and wide; but by his own END
BEGIN NOW First seen: Them unexpected joy surprised, END
BEGIN NOW When the great ensign of Messiah blazed END
BEGIN NOW Aloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven; END
BEGIN NOW Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced END
BEGIN NOW His army, circumfused on either wing, END
BEGIN NOW Under their Head imbodied all in one. END
BEGIN NOW Before him Power Divine his way prepared; END
BEGIN NOW At his command the uprooted hills retired END
BEGIN NOW Each to his place; they heard his voice, and went END
BEGIN NOW Obsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed, END
BEGIN NOW And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled. END
BEGIN NOW This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured, END
BEGIN NOW And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers, END
BEGIN NOW Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. END
BEGIN NOW In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? END
BEGIN NOW But to convince the proud what signs avail, END
BEGIN NOW Or wonders move the obdurate to relent? END
BEGIN NOW They, hardened more by what might most reclaim, END
BEGIN NOW Grieving to see his glory, at the sight END
BEGIN NOW Took envy; and, aspiring to his highth, END
BEGIN NOW Stood re-embattled fierce, by force or fraud END
BEGIN NOW Weening to prosper, and at length prevail END
BEGIN NOW Against God and Messiah, or to fall END
BEGIN NOW In universal ruin last; and now END
BEGIN NOW To final battle drew, disdaining flight, END
BEGIN NOW Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God END
BEGIN NOW To all his host on either hand thus spake. END
BEGIN NOW Stand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand, END
BEGIN NOW Ye Angels armed; this day from battle rest: END
BEGIN NOW Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God END
BEGIN NOW Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause; END
BEGIN NOW And as ye have received, so have ye done, END
BEGIN NOW Invincibly: But of this cursed crew END
BEGIN NOW The punishment to other hand belongs; END
BEGIN NOW Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints: END
BEGIN NOW Number to this day's work is not ordained, END
BEGIN NOW Nor multitude; stand only, and behold END
BEGIN NOW God's indignation on these godless poured END
BEGIN NOW By me; not you, but me, they have despised, END
BEGIN NOW Yet envied; against me is all their rage, END
BEGIN NOW Because the Father, to whom in Heaven s'preme END
BEGIN NOW Kingdom, and power, and glory appertains, END
BEGIN NOW Hath honoured me, according to his will. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned; END
BEGIN NOW That they may have their wish, to try with me END
BEGIN NOW In battle which the stronger proves; they all, END
BEGIN NOW Or I alone against them; since by strength END
BEGIN NOW They measure all, of other excellence END
BEGIN NOW Not emulous, nor care who them excels; END
BEGIN NOW Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Son, and into terrour changed END
BEGIN NOW His countenance too severe to be beheld, END
BEGIN NOW And full of wrath bent on his enemies. END
BEGIN NOW At once the Four spread out their starry wings END
BEGIN NOW With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs END
BEGIN NOW Of his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound END
BEGIN NOW Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host. END
BEGIN NOW He on his impious foes right onward drove, END
BEGIN NOW Gloomy as night; under his burning wheels END
BEGIN NOW The stedfast empyrean shook throughout, END
BEGIN NOW All but the throne itself of God. Full soon END
BEGIN NOW Among them he arrived; in his right hand END
BEGIN NOW Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent END
BEGIN NOW Before him, such as in their souls infixed END
BEGIN NOW Plagues: They, astonished, all resistance lost, END
BEGIN NOW All courage; down their idle weapons dropt: END
BEGIN NOW O'er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode END
BEGIN NOW Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, END
BEGIN NOW That wished the mountains now might be again END
BEGIN NOW Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire. END
BEGIN NOW Nor less on either side tempestuous fell END
BEGIN NOW His arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four END
BEGIN NOW Distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels END
BEGIN NOW Distinct alike with multitude of eyes; END
BEGIN NOW One Spirit in them ruled; and every eye END
BEGIN NOW Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire END
BEGIN NOW Among the accursed, that withered all their strength, END
BEGIN NOW And of their wonted vigour left them drained, END
BEGIN NOW Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen. END
BEGIN NOW Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked END
BEGIN NOW His thunder in mid volley; for he meant END
BEGIN NOW Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven: END
BEGIN NOW The overthrown he raised, and as a herd END
BEGIN NOW Of goats or timorous flock together thronged END
BEGIN NOW Drove them before him thunder-struck, pursued END
BEGIN NOW With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds END
BEGIN NOW And crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide, END
BEGIN NOW Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed END
BEGIN NOW Into the wasteful deep: The monstrous sight END
BEGIN NOW Struck them with horrour backward, but far worse END
BEGIN NOW Urged them behind: Headlong themselves they threw END
BEGIN NOW Down from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath END
BEGIN NOW Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. END
BEGIN NOW Hell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw END
BEGIN NOW Heaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled END
BEGIN NOW Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep END
BEGIN NOW Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. END
BEGIN NOW Nine days they fell: Confounded Chaos roared, END
BEGIN NOW And felt tenfold confusion in their fall END
BEGIN NOW Through his wild anarchy, so huge a rout END
BEGIN NOW Incumbered him with ruin: Hell at last END
BEGIN NOW Yawning received them whole, and on them closed; END
BEGIN NOW Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire END
BEGIN NOW Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain. END
BEGIN NOW Disburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired END
BEGIN NOW Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled. END
BEGIN NOW Sole victor, from the expulsion of his foes, END
BEGIN NOW Messiah his triumphal chariot turned: END
BEGIN NOW To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood END
BEGIN NOW Eye-witnesses of his almighty acts, END
BEGIN NOW With jubilee advanced; and, as they went, END
BEGIN NOW Shaded with branching palm, each Order bright, END
BEGIN NOW Sung triumph, and him sung victorious King, END
BEGIN NOW Son, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given, END
BEGIN NOW Worthiest to reign: He, celebrated, rode END
BEGIN NOW Triumphant through mid Heaven, into the courts END
BEGIN NOW And temple of his Mighty Father throned END
BEGIN NOW On high; who into glory him received, END
BEGIN NOW Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth, END
BEGIN NOW At thy request, and that thou mayest beware END
BEGIN NOW By what is past, to thee I have revealed END
BEGIN NOW What might have else to human race been hid; END
BEGIN NOW The discord which befel, and war in Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Among the angelick Powers, and the deep fall END
BEGIN NOW Of those too high aspiring, who rebelled END
BEGIN NOW With Satan; he who envies now thy state, END
BEGIN NOW Who now is plotting how he may seduce END
BEGIN NOW Thee also from obedience, that, with him END
BEGIN NOW Bereaved of happiness, thou mayest partake END
BEGIN NOW His punishment, eternal misery; END
BEGIN NOW Which would be all his solace and revenge, END
BEGIN NOW As a despite done against the Most High, END
BEGIN NOW Thee once to gain companion of his woe. END
BEGIN NOW But listen not to his temptations, warn END
BEGIN NOW Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard, END
BEGIN NOW By terrible example, the reward END
BEGIN NOW Of disobedience; firm they might have stood, END
BEGIN NOW Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress. END
BEGIN NOW Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name END
BEGIN NOW If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine END
BEGIN NOW Following, above the Olympian hill I soar, END
BEGIN NOW Above the flight of Pegasean wing! END
BEGIN NOW The meaning, not the name, I call: for thou END
BEGIN NOW Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top END
BEGIN NOW Of old Olympus dwellest; but, heavenly-born, END
BEGIN NOW Before the hills appeared, or fountain flowed, END
BEGIN NOW Thou with eternal Wisdom didst converse, END
BEGIN NOW Wisdom thy sister, and with her didst play END
BEGIN NOW In presence of the Almighty Father, pleased END
BEGIN NOW With thy celestial song. Up led by thee END
BEGIN NOW Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed, END
BEGIN NOW An earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air, END
BEGIN NOW Thy tempering: with like safety guided down END
BEGIN NOW Return me to my native element: END
BEGIN NOW Lest from this flying steed unreined, (as once END
BEGIN NOW Bellerophon, though from a lower clime,) END
BEGIN NOW Dismounted, on the Aleian field I fall, END
BEGIN NOW Erroneous there to wander, and forlorn. END
BEGIN NOW Half yet remains unsung, but narrower bound END
BEGIN NOW Within the visible diurnal sphere; END
BEGIN NOW Standing on earth, not rapt above the pole, END
BEGIN NOW More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged END
BEGIN NOW To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days, END
BEGIN NOW On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues; END
BEGIN NOW In darkness, and with dangers compassed round, END
BEGIN NOW And solitude; yet not alone, while thou END
BEGIN NOW Visitest my slumbers nightly, or when morn END
BEGIN NOW Purples the east: still govern thou my song, END
BEGIN NOW Urania, and fit audience find, though few. END
BEGIN NOW But drive far off the barbarous dissonance END
BEGIN NOW Of Bacchus and his revellers, the race END
BEGIN NOW Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard END
BEGIN NOW In Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears END
BEGIN NOW To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned END
BEGIN NOW Both harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend END
BEGIN NOW Her son. So fail not thou, who thee implores: END
BEGIN NOW For thou art heavenly, she an empty dream. END
BEGIN NOW Say, Goddess, what ensued when Raphael, END
BEGIN NOW The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarned END
BEGIN NOW Adam, by dire example, to beware END
BEGIN NOW Apostasy, by what befel in Heaven END
BEGIN NOW To those apostates; lest the like befall END
BEGIN NOW In Paradise to Adam or his race, END
BEGIN NOW Charged not to touch the interdicted tree, END
BEGIN NOW If they transgress, and slight that sole command, END
BEGIN NOW So easily obeyed amid the choice END
BEGIN NOW Of all tastes else to please their appetite, END
BEGIN NOW Though wandering. He, with his consorted Eve, END
BEGIN NOW The story heard attentive, and was filled END
BEGIN NOW With admiration and deep muse, to hear END
BEGIN NOW Of things so high and strange; things, to their thought END
BEGIN NOW So unimaginable, as hate in Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW And war so near the peace of God in bliss, END
BEGIN NOW With such confusion: but the evil, soon END
BEGIN NOW Driven back, redounded as a flood on those END
BEGIN NOW From whom it sprung; impossible to mix END
BEGIN NOW With blessedness. Whence Adam soon repealed END
BEGIN NOW The doubts that in his heart arose: and now END
BEGIN NOW Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know END
BEGIN NOW What nearer might concern him, how this world END
BEGIN NOW Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began; END
BEGIN NOW When, and whereof created; for what cause; END
BEGIN NOW What within Eden, or without, was done END
BEGIN NOW Before his memory; as one whose drouth END
BEGIN NOW Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream, END
BEGIN NOW Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites, END
BEGIN NOW Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest. END
BEGIN NOW Great things, and full of wonder in our ears, END
BEGIN NOW Far differing from this world, thou hast revealed, END
BEGIN NOW Divine interpreter! by favour sent END
BEGIN NOW Down from the empyrean, to forewarn END
BEGIN NOW Us timely of what might else have been our loss, END
BEGIN NOW Unknown, which human knowledge could not reach; END
BEGIN NOW For which to the infinitely Good we owe END
BEGIN NOW Immortal thanks, and his admonishment END
BEGIN NOW Receive, with solemn purpose to observe END
BEGIN NOW Immutably his sovran will, the end END
BEGIN NOW Of what we are. But since thou hast vouchsafed END
BEGIN NOW Gently, for our instruction, to impart END
BEGIN NOW Things above earthly thought, which yet concerned END
BEGIN NOW Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemed, END
BEGIN NOW Deign to descend now lower, and relate END
BEGIN NOW What may no less perhaps avail us known, END
BEGIN NOW How first began this Heaven which we behold END
BEGIN NOW Distant so high, with moving fires adorned END
BEGIN NOW Innumerable; and this which yields or fills END
BEGIN NOW All space, the ambient air wide interfused END
BEGIN NOW Embracing round this floried Earth; what cause END
BEGIN NOW Moved the Creator, in his holy rest END
BEGIN NOW Through all eternity, so late to build END
BEGIN NOW In Chaos; and the work begun, how soon END
BEGIN NOW Absolved; if unforbid thou mayest unfold END
BEGIN NOW What we, not to explore the secrets ask END
BEGIN NOW Of his eternal empire, but the more END
BEGIN NOW To magnify his works, the more we know. END
BEGIN NOW And the great light of day yet wants to run END
BEGIN NOW Much of his race though steep; suspense in Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Held by thy voice, thy potent voice, he hears, END
BEGIN NOW And longer will delay to hear thee tell END
BEGIN NOW His generation, and the rising birth END
BEGIN NOW Of Nature from the unapparent Deep: END
BEGIN NOW Or if the star of evening and the moon END
BEGIN NOW Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring, END
BEGIN NOW Silence; and Sleep, listening to thee, will watch; END
BEGIN NOW Or we can bid his absence, till thy song END
BEGIN NOW End, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought: END
BEGIN NOW And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild. END
BEGIN NOW This also thy request, with caution asked, END
BEGIN NOW Obtain; though to recount almighty works END
BEGIN NOW What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, END
BEGIN NOW Or heart of man suffice to comprehend? END
BEGIN NOW Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve END
BEGIN NOW To glorify the Maker, and infer END
BEGIN NOW Thee also happier, shall not be withheld END
BEGIN NOW Thy hearing; such commission from above END
BEGIN NOW I have received, to answer thy desire END
BEGIN NOW Of knowledge within bounds; beyond, abstain END
BEGIN NOW To ask; nor let thine own inventions hope END
BEGIN NOW Things not revealed, which the invisible King, END
BEGIN NOW Only Omniscient, hath suppressed in night; END
BEGIN NOW To none communicable in Earth or Heaven: END
BEGIN NOW Enough is left besides to search and know. END
BEGIN NOW But knowledge is as food, and needs no less END
BEGIN NOW Her temperance over appetite, to know END
BEGIN NOW In measure what the mind may well contain; END
BEGIN NOW Oppresses else with surfeit, and soon turns END
BEGIN NOW Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind. END
BEGIN NOW Know then, that, after Lucifer from Heaven END
BEGIN NOW (So call him, brighter once amidst the host END
BEGIN NOW Of Angels, than that star the stars among,) END
BEGIN NOW Fell with his flaming legions through the deep END
BEGIN NOW Into his place, and the great Son returned END
BEGIN NOW Victorious with his Saints, the Omnipotent END
BEGIN NOW Eternal Father from his throne beheld END
BEGIN NOW Their multitude, and to his Son thus spake. END
BEGIN NOW At least our envious Foe hath failed, who thought END
BEGIN NOW All like himself rebellious, by whose aid END
BEGIN NOW This inaccessible high strength, the seat END
BEGIN NOW Of Deity supreme, us dispossessed, END
BEGIN NOW He trusted to have seised, and into fraud END
BEGIN NOW Drew many, whom their place knows here no more: END
BEGIN NOW Yet far the greater part have kept, I see, END
BEGIN NOW Their station; Heaven, yet populous, retains END
BEGIN NOW Number sufficient to possess her realms END
BEGIN NOW Though wide, and this high temple to frequent END
BEGIN NOW With ministeries due, and solemn rites: END
BEGIN NOW But, lest his heart exalt him in the harm END
BEGIN NOW Already done, to have dispeopled Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW My damage fondly deemed, I can repair END
BEGIN NOW That detriment, if such it be to lose END
BEGIN NOW Self-lost; and in a moment will create END
BEGIN NOW Another world, out of one man a race END
BEGIN NOW Of men innumerable, there to dwell, END
BEGIN NOW Not here; till, by degrees of merit raised, END
BEGIN NOW They open to themselves at length the way END
BEGIN NOW Up hither, under long obedience tried; END
BEGIN NOW And Earth be changed to Heaven, and Heaven to Earth, END
BEGIN NOW One kingdom, joy and union without end. END
BEGIN NOW Mean while inhabit lax, ye Powers of Heaven; END
BEGIN NOW And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee END
BEGIN NOW This I perform; speak thou, and be it done! END
BEGIN NOW My overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee END
BEGIN NOW I send along; ride forth, and bid the Deep END
BEGIN NOW Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth; END
BEGIN NOW Boundless the Deep, because I Am who fill END
BEGIN NOW Infinitude, nor vacuous the space. END
BEGIN NOW Though I, uncircumscribed myself, retire, END
BEGIN NOW And put not forth my goodness, which is free END
BEGIN NOW To act or not, Necessity and Chance END
BEGIN NOW Approach not me, and what I will is Fate. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Almighty, and to what he spake END
BEGIN NOW His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect. END
BEGIN NOW Immediate are the acts of God, more swift END
BEGIN NOW Than time or motion, but to human ears END
BEGIN NOW Cannot without process of speech be told, END
BEGIN NOW So told as earthly notion can receive. END
BEGIN NOW Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW When such was heard declared the Almighty's will; END
BEGIN NOW Glory they sung to the Most High, good will END
BEGIN NOW To future men, and in their dwellings peace; END
BEGIN NOW Glory to Him, whose just avenging ire END
BEGIN NOW Had driven out the ungodly from his sight END
BEGIN NOW And the habitations of the just; to Him END
BEGIN NOW Glory and praise, whose wisdom had ordained END
BEGIN NOW Good out of evil to create; instead END
BEGIN NOW Of Spirits malign, a better race to bring END
BEGIN NOW Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse END
BEGIN NOW His good to worlds and ages infinite. END
BEGIN NOW So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son END
BEGIN NOW On his great expedition now appeared, END
BEGIN NOW Girt with Omnipotence, with radiance crowned END
BEGIN NOW Of Majesty Divine; sapience and love END
BEGIN NOW Immense, and all his Father in him shone. END
BEGIN NOW About his chariot numberless were poured END
BEGIN NOW And Virtues, winged Spirits, and chariots winged END
BEGIN NOW From the armoury of God; where stand of old END
BEGIN NOW Myriads, between two brazen mountains lodged END
BEGIN NOW Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand, END
BEGIN NOW Celestial equipage; and now came forth END
BEGIN NOW Spontaneous, for within them Spirit lived, END
BEGIN NOW Attendant on their Lord: Heaven opened wide END
BEGIN NOW Her ever-during gates, harmonious sound END
BEGIN NOW On golden hinges moving, to let forth END
BEGIN NOW The King of Glory, in his powerful Word END
BEGIN NOW And Spirit, coming to create new worlds. END
BEGIN NOW On heavenly ground they stood; and from the shore END
BEGIN NOW They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss END
BEGIN NOW Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild, END
BEGIN NOW Up from the bottom turned by furious winds END
BEGIN NOW And surging waves, as mountains, to assault END
BEGIN NOW Heaven's highth, and with the center mix the pole. END
BEGIN NOW Silence, ye troubled Waves, and thou Deep, peace, END
BEGIN NOW Said then the Omnifick Word; your discord end! END
BEGIN NOW Nor staid; but, on the wings of Cherubim END
BEGIN NOW Uplifted, in paternal glory rode END
BEGIN NOW Far into Chaos, and the world unborn; END
BEGIN NOW For Chaos heard his voice: Him all his train END
BEGIN NOW Followed in bright procession, to behold END
BEGIN NOW Creation, and the wonders of his might. END
BEGIN NOW Then staid the fervid wheels, and in his hand END
BEGIN NOW He took the golden compasses, prepared END
BEGIN NOW In God's eternal store, to circumscribe END
BEGIN NOW This universe, and all created things: END
BEGIN NOW One foot he centered, and the other turned END
BEGIN NOW Round through the vast profundity obscure; END
BEGIN NOW And said, Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds, END
BEGIN NOW This be thy just circumference, O World! END
BEGIN NOW Thus God the Heaven created, thus the Earth, END
BEGIN NOW Matter unformed and void: Darkness profound END
BEGIN NOW Covered the abyss: but on the watery calm END
BEGIN NOW His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread, END
BEGIN NOW And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth END
BEGIN NOW Throughout the fluid mass; but downward purged END
BEGIN NOW The black tartareous cold infernal dregs, END
BEGIN NOW Adverse to life: then founded, then conglobed END
BEGIN NOW Like things to like; the rest to several place END
BEGIN NOW Disparted, and between spun out the air; END
BEGIN NOW And Earth self-balanced on her center hung. END
BEGIN NOW Let there be light, said God; and forthwith Light END
BEGIN NOW Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure, END
BEGIN NOW Sprung from the deep; and from her native east END
BEGIN NOW To journey through the aery gloom began, END
BEGIN NOW Sphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun END
BEGIN NOW Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle END
BEGIN NOW Sojourned the while. God saw the light was good; END
BEGIN NOW And light from darkness by the hemisphere END
BEGIN NOW Divided: light the Day, and darkness Night, END
BEGIN NOW He named. Thus was the first day even and morn: END
BEGIN NOW Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung END
BEGIN NOW By the celestial quires, when orient light END
BEGIN NOW Exhaling first from darkness they beheld; END
BEGIN NOW Birth-day of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout END
BEGIN NOW The hollow universal orb they filled, END
BEGIN NOW And touched their golden harps, and hymning praised END
BEGIN NOW God and his works; Creator him they sung, END
BEGIN NOW Both when first evening was, and when first morn. END
BEGIN NOW Again, God said, Let there be firmament END
BEGIN NOW Amid the waters, and let it divide END
BEGIN NOW The waters from the waters; and God made END
BEGIN NOW The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, END
BEGIN NOW Transparent, elemental air, diffused END
BEGIN NOW In circuit to the uttermost convex END
BEGIN NOW Of this great round; partition firm and sure, END
BEGIN NOW The waters underneath from those above END
BEGIN NOW Dividing: for as earth, so he the world END
BEGIN NOW Built on circumfluous waters calm, in wide END
BEGIN NOW Crystalline ocean, and the loud misrule END
BEGIN NOW Of Chaos far removed; lest fierce extremes END
BEGIN NOW Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: END
BEGIN NOW And Heaven he named the Firmament: So even END
BEGIN NOW And morning chorus sung the second day. END
BEGIN NOW The Earth was formed, but in the womb as yet END
BEGIN NOW Of waters, embryon immature involved, END
BEGIN NOW Appeared not: over all the face of Earth END
BEGIN NOW Main ocean flowed, not idle; but, with warm END
BEGIN NOW Prolifick humour softening all her globe, END
BEGIN NOW Fermented the great mother to conceive, END
BEGIN NOW Satiate with genial moisture; when God said, END
BEGIN NOW Be gathered now ye waters under Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Into one place, and let dry land appear. END
BEGIN NOW Immediately the mountains huge appear END
BEGIN NOW Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave END
BEGIN NOW Into the clouds; their tops ascend the sky: END
BEGIN NOW So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low END
BEGIN NOW Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, END
BEGIN NOW Capacious bed of waters: Thither they END
BEGIN NOW Hasted with glad precipitance, uprolled, END
BEGIN NOW As drops on dust conglobing from the dry: END
BEGIN NOW Part rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct, END
BEGIN NOW For haste; such flight the great command impressed END
BEGIN NOW On the swift floods: As armies at the call END
BEGIN NOW Of trumpet (for of armies thou hast heard) END
BEGIN NOW Troop to their standard; so the watery throng, END
BEGIN NOW Wave rolling after wave, where way they found, END
BEGIN NOW If steep, with torrent rapture, if through plain, END
BEGIN NOW Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill; END
BEGIN NOW But they, or under ground, or circuit wide END
BEGIN NOW With serpent errour wandering, found their way, END
BEGIN NOW And on the washy oose deep channels wore; END
BEGIN NOW Easy, ere God had bid the ground be dry, END
BEGIN NOW All but within those banks, where rivers now END
BEGIN NOW Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train. END
BEGIN NOW The dry land, Earth; and the great receptacle END
BEGIN NOW Of congregated waters, he called Seas: END
BEGIN NOW And saw that it was good; and said, Let the Earth END
BEGIN NOW Put forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed, END
BEGIN NOW And fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind, END
BEGIN NOW Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth. END
BEGIN NOW He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then END
BEGIN NOW Desart and bare, unsightly, unadorned, END
BEGIN NOW Brought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad END
BEGIN NOW Her universal face with pleasant green; END
BEGIN NOW Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered END
BEGIN NOW Opening their various colours, and made gay END
BEGIN NOW Her bosom, smelling sweet: and, these scarce blown, END
BEGIN NOW Forth flourished thick the clustering vine, forth crept END
BEGIN NOW The swelling gourd, up stood the corny reed END
BEGIN NOW Embattled in her field, and the humble shrub, END
BEGIN NOW And bush with frizzled hair implicit: Last END
BEGIN NOW Rose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread END
BEGIN NOW Their branches hung with copious fruit, or gemmed END
BEGIN NOW Their blossoms: With high woods the hills were crowned; END
BEGIN NOW With tufts the valleys, and each fountain side; END
BEGIN NOW With borders long the rivers: that Earth now END
BEGIN NOW Seemed like to Heaven, a seat where Gods might dwell, END
BEGIN NOW Or wander with delight, and love to haunt END
BEGIN NOW Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rained END
BEGIN NOW Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground END
BEGIN NOW None was; but from the Earth a dewy mist END
BEGIN NOW Went up, and watered all the ground, and each END
BEGIN NOW Plant of the field; which, ere it was in the Earth, END
BEGIN NOW God made, and every herb, before it grew END
BEGIN NOW On the green stem: God saw that it was good: END
BEGIN NOW So even and morn recorded the third day. END
BEGIN NOW Again the Almighty spake, Let there be lights END
BEGIN NOW High in the expanse of Heaven, to divide END
BEGIN NOW The day from night; and let them be for signs, END
BEGIN NOW For seasons, and for days, and circling years; END
BEGIN NOW And let them be for lights, as I ordain END
BEGIN NOW Their office in the firmament of Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW To give light on the Earth; and it was so. END
BEGIN NOW And God made two great lights, great for their use END
BEGIN NOW To Man, the greater to have rule by day, END
BEGIN NOW The less by night, altern; and made the stars, END
BEGIN NOW And set them in the firmament of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW To illuminate the Earth, and rule the day END
BEGIN NOW In their vicissitude, and rule the night, END
BEGIN NOW And light from darkness to divide. God saw, END
BEGIN NOW Surveying his great work, that it was good: END
BEGIN NOW For of celestial bodies first the sun END
BEGIN NOW A mighty sphere he framed, unlightsome first, END
BEGIN NOW Though of ethereal mould: then formed the moon END
BEGIN NOW Globose, and every magnitude of stars, END
BEGIN NOW And sowed with stars the Heaven, thick as a field: END
BEGIN NOW Of light by far the greater part he took, END
BEGIN NOW Transplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed END
BEGIN NOW In the sun's orb, made porous to receive END
BEGIN NOW And drink the liquid light; firm to retain END
BEGIN NOW Her gathered beams, great palace now of light. END
BEGIN NOW Hither, as to their fountain, other stars END
BEGIN NOW Repairing, in their golden urns draw light, END
BEGIN NOW And hence the morning-planet gilds her horns; END
BEGIN NOW By tincture or reflection they augment END
BEGIN NOW Their small peculiar, though from human sight END
BEGIN NOW So far remote, with diminution seen, END
BEGIN NOW First in his east the glorious lamp was seen, END
BEGIN NOW Regent of day, and all the horizon round END
BEGIN NOW Invested with bright rays, jocund to run END
BEGIN NOW His longitude through Heaven's high road; the gray END
BEGIN NOW Dawn, and the Pleiades, before him danced, END
BEGIN NOW Shedding sweet influence: Less bright the moon, END
BEGIN NOW But opposite in levelled west was set, END
BEGIN NOW His mirrour, with full face borrowing her light END
BEGIN NOW From him; for other light she needed none END
BEGIN NOW In that aspect, and still that distance keeps END
BEGIN NOW Till night; then in the east her turn she shines, END
BEGIN NOW Revolved on Heaven's great axle, and her reign END
BEGIN NOW With thousand lesser lights dividual holds, END
BEGIN NOW With thousand thousand stars, that then appeared END
BEGIN NOW Spangling the hemisphere: Then first adorned END
BEGIN NOW With their bright luminaries that set and rose, END
BEGIN NOW Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day. END
BEGIN NOW And God said, Let the waters generate END
BEGIN NOW Reptile with spawn abundant, living soul: END
BEGIN NOW And let fowl fly above the Earth, with wings END
BEGIN NOW Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW And God created the great whales, and each END
BEGIN NOW Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously END
BEGIN NOW The waters generated by their kinds; END
BEGIN NOW And every bird of wing after his kind; END
BEGIN NOW And saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying. END
BEGIN NOW Be fruitful, multiply, and in the seas, END
BEGIN NOW And lakes, and running streams, the waters fill; END
BEGIN NOW And let the fowl be multiplied, on the Earth. END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith the sounds and seas, each creek and bay, END
BEGIN NOW With fry innumerable swarm, and shoals END
BEGIN NOW Of fish that with their fins, and shining scales, END
BEGIN NOW Glide under the green wave, in sculls that oft END
BEGIN NOW Bank the mid sea: part single, or with mate, END
BEGIN NOW Graze the sea-weed their pasture, and through groves END
BEGIN NOW Of coral stray; or, sporting with quick glance, END
BEGIN NOW Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold; END
BEGIN NOW Or, in their pearly shells at ease, attend END
BEGIN NOW Moist nutriment; or under rocks their food END
BEGIN NOW In jointed armour watch: on smooth the seal END
BEGIN NOW And bended dolphins play: part huge of bulk END
BEGIN NOW Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait, END
BEGIN NOW Tempest the ocean: there leviathan, END
BEGIN NOW Hugest of living creatures, on the deep END
BEGIN NOW Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims, END
BEGIN NOW And seems a moving land; and at his gills END
BEGIN NOW Draws in, and at his trunk spouts out, a sea. END
BEGIN NOW Mean while the tepid caves, and fens, and shores, END
BEGIN NOW Their brood as numerous hatch, from the egg that soon END
BEGIN NOW Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed END
BEGIN NOW Their callow young; but feathered soon and fledge END
BEGIN NOW They summed their pens; and, soaring the air sublime, END
BEGIN NOW With clang despised the ground, under a cloud END
BEGIN NOW In prospect; there the eagle and the stork END
BEGIN NOW On cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build: END
BEGIN NOW Part loosely wing the region, part more wise END
BEGIN NOW In common, ranged in figure, wedge their way, END
BEGIN NOW Intelligent of seasons, and set forth END
BEGIN NOW Their aery caravan, high over seas END
BEGIN NOW Flying, and over lands, with mutual wing END
BEGIN NOW Easing their flight; so steers the prudent crane END
BEGIN NOW Her annual voyage, borne on winds; the air END
BEGIN NOW Floats as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes: END
BEGIN NOW From branch to branch the smaller birds with song END
BEGIN NOW Solaced the woods, and spread their painted wings END
BEGIN NOW Till even; nor then the solemn nightingale END
BEGIN NOW Ceased warbling, but all night tun'd her soft lays: END
BEGIN NOW Others, on silver lakes and rivers, bathed END
BEGIN NOW Their downy breast; the swan with arched neck, END
BEGIN NOW Between her white wings mantling proudly, rows END
BEGIN NOW Her state with oary feet; yet oft they quit END
BEGIN NOW The dank, and, rising on stiff pennons, tower END
BEGIN NOW The mid aereal sky: Others on ground END
BEGIN NOW Walked firm; the crested cock whose clarion sounds END
BEGIN NOW The silent hours, and the other whose gay train END
BEGIN NOW Adorns him, coloured with the florid hue END
BEGIN NOW Of rainbows and starry eyes. The waters thus END
BEGIN NOW With fish replenished, and the air with fowl, END
BEGIN NOW Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day. END
BEGIN NOW The sixth, and of creation last, arose END
BEGIN NOW With evening harps and matin; when God said, END
BEGIN NOW Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind, END
BEGIN NOW Cattle, and creeping things, and beast of the Earth, END
BEGIN NOW Each in their kind. The Earth obeyed, and straight END
BEGIN NOW Opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth END
BEGIN NOW Innumerous living creatures, perfect forms, END
BEGIN NOW Limbed and full grown: Out of the ground up rose, END
BEGIN NOW As from his lair, the wild beast where he wons END
BEGIN NOW In forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den; END
BEGIN NOW Among the trees in pairs they rose, they walked: END
BEGIN NOW The cattle in the fields and meadows green: END
BEGIN NOW Those rare and solitary, these in flocks END
BEGIN NOW Pasturing at once, and in broad herds upsprung. END
BEGIN NOW The grassy clods now calved; now half appeared END
BEGIN NOW The tawny lion, pawing to get free END
BEGIN NOW His hinder parts, then springs as broke from bonds, END
BEGIN NOW And rampant shakes his brinded mane; the ounce, END
BEGIN NOW The libbard, and the tiger, as the mole END
BEGIN NOW Rising, the crumbled earth above them threw END
BEGIN NOW In hillocks: The swift stag from under ground END
BEGIN NOW Bore up his branching head: Scarce from his mould END
BEGIN NOW Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved END
BEGIN NOW His vastness: Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose, END
BEGIN NOW As plants: Ambiguous between sea and land END
BEGIN NOW The river-horse, and scaly crocodile. END
BEGIN NOW At once came forth whatever creeps the ground, END
BEGIN NOW Insect or worm: those waved their limber fans END
BEGIN NOW For wings, and smallest lineaments exact END
BEGIN NOW In all the liveries decked of summer's pride END
BEGIN NOW With spots of gold and purple, azure and green: END
BEGIN NOW These, as a line, their long dimension drew, END
BEGIN NOW Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all END
BEGIN NOW Minims of nature; some of serpent-kind, END
BEGIN NOW Wonderous in length and corpulence, involved END
BEGIN NOW Their snaky folds, and added wings. First crept END
BEGIN NOW The parsimonious emmet, provident END
BEGIN NOW Of future; in small room large heart enclosed; END
BEGIN NOW Pattern of just equality perhaps END
BEGIN NOW Hereafter, joined in her popular tribes END
BEGIN NOW Of commonalty: Swarming next appeared END
BEGIN NOW The female bee, that feeds her husband drone END
BEGIN NOW Deliciously, and builds her waxen cells END
BEGIN NOW With honey stored: The rest are numberless, END
BEGIN NOW And thou their natures knowest, and gavest them names, END
BEGIN NOW Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown END
BEGIN NOW The serpent, subtlest beast of all the field, END
BEGIN NOW Of huge extent sometimes, with brazen eyes END
BEGIN NOW And hairy mane terrifick, though to thee END
BEGIN NOW Not noxious, but obedient at thy call. END
BEGIN NOW Now Heaven in all her glory shone, and rolled END
BEGIN NOW Her motions, as the great first Mover's hand END
BEGIN NOW First wheeled their course: Earth in her rich attire END
BEGIN NOW Consummate lovely smiled; air, water, earth, END
BEGIN NOW By fowl, fish, beast, was flown, was swum, was walked, END
BEGIN NOW Frequent; and of the sixth day yet remained: END
BEGIN NOW There wanted yet the master-work, the end END
BEGIN NOW Of all yet done; a creature, who, not prone END
BEGIN NOW And brute as other creatures, but endued END
BEGIN NOW With sanctity of reason, might erect END
BEGIN NOW His stature, and upright with front serene END
BEGIN NOW Govern the rest, self-knowing; and from thence END
BEGIN NOW Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW But grateful to acknowledge whence his good END
BEGIN NOW Descends, thither with heart, and voice, and eyes END
BEGIN NOW Directed in devotion, to adore END
BEGIN NOW And worship God Supreme, who made him chief END
BEGIN NOW Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent END
BEGIN NOW Eternal Father (for where is not he END
BEGIN NOW Present?) thus to his Son audibly spake. END
BEGIN NOW Let us make now Man in our image, Man END
BEGIN NOW In our similitude, and let them rule END
BEGIN NOW Over the fish and fowl of sea and air, END
BEGIN NOW Beast of the field, and over all the Earth, END
BEGIN NOW And every creeping thing that creeps the ground. END
BEGIN NOW This said, he formed thee, Adam, thee, O Man, END
BEGIN NOW Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed END
BEGIN NOW The breath of life; in his own image he END
BEGIN NOW Created thee, in the image of God END
BEGIN NOW Express; and thou becamest a living soul. END
BEGIN NOW Male he created thee; but thy consort END
BEGIN NOW Female, for race; then blessed mankind, and said, END
BEGIN NOW Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the Earth; END
BEGIN NOW Subdue it, and throughout dominion hold END
BEGIN NOW Over fish of the sea, and fowl of the air, END
BEGIN NOW And every living thing that moves on the Earth. END
BEGIN NOW Wherever thus created, for no place END
BEGIN NOW Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knowest, END
BEGIN NOW He brought thee into this delicious grove, END
BEGIN NOW This garden, planted with the trees of God, END
BEGIN NOW Delectable both to behold and taste; END
BEGIN NOW And freely all their pleasant fruit for food END
BEGIN NOW Gave thee; all sorts are here that all the Earth yields, END
BEGIN NOW Variety without end; but of the tree, END
BEGIN NOW Which, tasted, works knowledge of good and evil, END
BEGIN NOW Thou mayest not; in the day thou eatest, thou diest; END
BEGIN NOW Death is the penalty imposed; beware, END
BEGIN NOW And govern well thy appetite; lest Sin END
BEGIN NOW Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death. END
BEGIN NOW Here finished he, and all that he had made END
BEGIN NOW Viewed, and behold all was entirely good; END
BEGIN NOW So even and morn accomplished the sixth day: END
BEGIN NOW Yet not till the Creator from his work END
BEGIN NOW Desisting, though unwearied, up returned, END
BEGIN NOW Up to the Heaven of Heavens, his high abode; END
BEGIN NOW Thence to behold this new created world, END
BEGIN NOW The addition of his empire, how it showed END
BEGIN NOW In prospect from his throne, how good, how fair, END
BEGIN NOW Answering his great idea. Up he rode END
BEGIN NOW Followed with acclamation, and the sound END
BEGIN NOW Symphonious of ten thousand harps, that tuned END
BEGIN NOW Angelick harmonies: The earth, the air END
BEGIN NOW Resounded, (thou rememberest, for thou heardst,) END
BEGIN NOW The heavens and all the constellations rung, END
BEGIN NOW The planets in their station listening stood, END
BEGIN NOW While the bright pomp ascended jubilant. END
BEGIN NOW Open, ye everlasting gates! they sung, END
BEGIN NOW Open, ye Heavens! your living doors; let in END
BEGIN NOW The great Creator from his work returned END
BEGIN NOW Magnificent, his six days work, a World; END
BEGIN NOW Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign END
BEGIN NOW To visit oft the dwellings of just men, END
BEGIN NOW Delighted; and with frequent intercourse END
BEGIN NOW Thither will send his winged messengers END
BEGIN NOW On errands of supernal grace. So sung END
BEGIN NOW The glorious train ascending: He through Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW That opened wide her blazing portals, led END
BEGIN NOW To God's eternal house direct the way; END
BEGIN NOW A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold END
BEGIN NOW And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear, END
BEGIN NOW Seen in the galaxy, that milky way, END
BEGIN NOW Which nightly, as a circling zone, thou seest END
BEGIN NOW Powdered with stars. And now on Earth the seventh END
BEGIN NOW Evening arose in Eden, for the sun END
BEGIN NOW Was set, and twilight from the east came on, END
BEGIN NOW Forerunning night; when at the holy mount END
BEGIN NOW Of Heaven's high-seated top, the imperial throne END
BEGIN NOW Of Godhead, fixed for ever firm and sure, END
BEGIN NOW The Filial Power arrived, and sat him down END
BEGIN NOW With his great Father; for he also went END
BEGIN NOW Invisible, yet staid, (such privilege END
BEGIN NOW Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordained, END
BEGIN NOW Author and End of all things; and, from work END
BEGIN NOW Now resting, blessed and hallowed the seventh day, END
BEGIN NOW As resting on that day from all his work, END
BEGIN NOW But not in silence holy kept: the harp END
BEGIN NOW Had work and rested not; the solemn pipe, END
BEGIN NOW And dulcimer, all organs of sweet stop, END
BEGIN NOW All sounds on fret by string or golden wire, END
BEGIN NOW Tempered soft tunings, intermixed with voice END
BEGIN NOW Choral or unison: of incense clouds, END
BEGIN NOW Fuming from golden censers, hid the mount. END
BEGIN NOW Creation and the six days acts they sung: END
BEGIN NOW Great are thy works, Jehovah! infinite END
BEGIN NOW Thy power! what thought can measure thee, or tongue END
BEGIN NOW Relate thee! Greater now in thy return END
BEGIN NOW Than from the giant Angels: Thee that day END
BEGIN NOW Thy thunders magnified; but to create END
BEGIN NOW Is greater than created to destroy. END
BEGIN NOW Who can impair thee, Mighty King, or bound END
BEGIN NOW Thy empire! Easily the proud attempt END
BEGIN NOW Of Spirits apostate, and their counsels vain, END
BEGIN NOW Thou hast repelled; while impiously they thought END
BEGIN NOW Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw END
BEGIN NOW The number of thy worshippers. Who seeks END
BEGIN NOW To lessen thee, against his purpose serves END
BEGIN NOW To manifest the more thy might: his evil END
BEGIN NOW Thou usest, and from thence createst more good. END
BEGIN NOW Witness this new-made world, another Heaven END
BEGIN NOW From Heaven-gate not far, founded in view END
BEGIN NOW On the clear hyaline, the glassy sea; END
BEGIN NOW Of amplitude almost immense, with stars END
BEGIN NOW Numerous, and every star perhaps a world END
BEGIN NOW Of destined habitation; but thou knowest END
BEGIN NOW Their seasons: among these the seat of Men, END
BEGIN NOW Earth, with her nether ocean circumfused, END
BEGIN NOW Their pleasant dwelling-place. Thrice happy Men, END
BEGIN NOW And sons of Men, whom God hath thus advanced! END
BEGIN NOW Created in his image, there to dwell END
BEGIN NOW And worship him; and in reward to rule END
BEGIN NOW Over his works, on earth, in sea, or air, END
BEGIN NOW And multiply a race of worshippers END
BEGIN NOW Holy and just: Thrice happy, if they know END
BEGIN NOW Their happiness, and persevere upright! END
BEGIN NOW So sung they, and the empyrean rung END
BEGIN NOW With halleluiahs: Thus was sabbath kept. END
BEGIN NOW And thy request think now fulfilled, that asked END
BEGIN NOW How first this world and face of things began, END
BEGIN NOW And what before thy memory was done END
BEGIN NOW From the beginning; that posterity, END
BEGIN NOW Informed by thee, might know: If else thou seekest END
BEGIN NOW Aught, not surpassing human measure, say. END
BEGIN NOW The Angel ended, and in Adam's ear END
BEGIN NOW So charming left his voice, that he a while END
BEGIN NOW Thought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear; END
BEGIN NOW Then, as new waked, thus gratefully replied. END
BEGIN NOW What thanks sufficient, or what recompence END
BEGIN NOW Equal, have I to render thee, divine END
BEGIN NOW Historian, who thus largely hast allayed END
BEGIN NOW The thirst I had of knowledge, and vouchsafed END
BEGIN NOW This friendly condescension to relate END
BEGIN NOW Things, else by me unsearchable; now heard END
BEGIN NOW With wonder, but delight, and, as is due, END
BEGIN NOW With glory attributed to the high END
BEGIN NOW Creator! Something yet of doubt remains, END
BEGIN NOW Which only thy solution can resolve. END
BEGIN NOW When I behold this goodly frame, this world, END
BEGIN NOW Of Heaven and Earth consisting; and compute END
BEGIN NOW Their magnitudes; this Earth, a spot, a grain, END
BEGIN NOW An atom, with the firmament compared END
BEGIN NOW And all her numbered stars, that seem to roll END
BEGIN NOW Spaces incomprehensible, (for such END
BEGIN NOW Their distance argues, and their swift return END
BEGIN NOW Diurnal,) merely to officiate light END
BEGIN NOW Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot, END
BEGIN NOW One day and night; in all her vast survey END
BEGIN NOW Useless besides; reasoning I oft admire, END
BEGIN NOW How Nature wise and frugal could commit END
BEGIN NOW Such disproportions, with superfluous hand END
BEGIN NOW So many nobler bodies to create, END
BEGIN NOW Greater so manifold, to this one use, END
BEGIN NOW For aught appears, and on their orbs impose END
BEGIN NOW Such restless revolution day by day END
BEGIN NOW Repeated; while the sedentary Earth, END
BEGIN NOW That better might with far less compass move, END
BEGIN NOW Served by more noble than herself, attains END
BEGIN NOW Her end without least motion, and receives, END
BEGIN NOW As tribute, such a sumless journey brought END
BEGIN NOW Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light; END
BEGIN NOW Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails. END
BEGIN NOW So spake our sire, and by his countenance seemed END
BEGIN NOW Entering on studious thoughts abstruse; which Eve END
BEGIN NOW Perceiving, where she sat retired in sight, END
BEGIN NOW With lowliness majestick from her seat, END
BEGIN NOW And grace that won who saw to wish her stay, END
BEGIN NOW Rose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers, END
BEGIN NOW To visit how they prospered, bud and bloom, END
BEGIN NOW Her nursery; they at her coming sprung, END
BEGIN NOW And, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew. END
BEGIN NOW Yet went she not, as not with such discourse END
BEGIN NOW Delighted, or not capable her ear END
BEGIN NOW Of what was high: such pleasure she reserved, END
BEGIN NOW Adam relating, she sole auditress; END
BEGIN NOW Her husband the relater she preferred END
BEGIN NOW Chose rather; he, she knew, would intermix END
BEGIN NOW Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute END
BEGIN NOW With conjugal caresses: from his lip END
BEGIN NOW Not words alone pleased her. O! when meet now END
BEGIN NOW Such pairs, in love and mutual honour joined? END
BEGIN NOW With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went, END
BEGIN NOW Not unattended; for on her, as Queen, END
BEGIN NOW A pomp of winning Graces waited still, END
BEGIN NOW And from about her shot darts of desire END
BEGIN NOW Into all eyes, to wish her still in sight. END
BEGIN NOW And Raphael now, to Adam's doubt proposed, END
BEGIN NOW Benevolent and facile thus replied. END
BEGIN NOW To ask or search, I blame thee not; for Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Is as the book of God before thee set, END
BEGIN NOW Wherein to read his wonderous works, and learn END
BEGIN NOW His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years: END
BEGIN NOW This to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth, END
BEGIN NOW Imports not, if thou reckon right; the rest END
BEGIN NOW From Man or Angel the great Architect END
BEGIN NOW Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge END
BEGIN NOW His secrets to be scanned by them who ought END
BEGIN NOW Rather admire; or, if they list to try END
BEGIN NOW Conjecture, he his fabrick of the Heavens END
BEGIN NOW Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move END
BEGIN NOW His laughter at their quaint opinions wide END
BEGIN NOW Hereafter; when they come to model Heaven END
BEGIN NOW And calculate the stars, how they will wield END
BEGIN NOW The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive END
BEGIN NOW To save appearances; how gird the sphere END
BEGIN NOW With centrick and eccentrick scribbled o'er, END
BEGIN NOW Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb: END
BEGIN NOW Already by thy reasoning this I guess, END
BEGIN NOW Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest END
BEGIN NOW That bodies bright and greater should not serve END
BEGIN NOW The less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run, END
BEGIN NOW Earth sitting still, when she alone receives END
BEGIN NOW The benefit: Consider first, that great END
BEGIN NOW Or bright infers not excellence: the Earth END
BEGIN NOW Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small, END
BEGIN NOW Nor glistering, may of solid good contain END
BEGIN NOW More plenty than the sun that barren shines; END
BEGIN NOW Whose virtue on itself works no effect, END
BEGIN NOW But in the fruitful Earth; there first received, END
BEGIN NOW His beams, unactive else, their vigour find. END
BEGIN NOW Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries END
BEGIN NOW Officious; but to thee, Earth's habitant. END
BEGIN NOW And for the Heaven's wide circuit, let it speak END
BEGIN NOW The Maker's high magnificence, who built END
BEGIN NOW So spacious, and his line stretched out so far; END
BEGIN NOW That Man may know he dwells not in his own; END
BEGIN NOW An edifice too large for him to fill, END
BEGIN NOW Lodged in a small partition; and the rest END
BEGIN NOW Ordained for uses to his Lord best known. END
BEGIN NOW The swiftness of those circles attribute, END
BEGIN NOW Though numberless, to his Omnipotence, END
BEGIN NOW That to corporeal substances could add END
BEGIN NOW Speed almost spiritual: Me thou thinkest not slow, END
BEGIN NOW Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Where God resides, and ere mid-day arrived END
BEGIN NOW In Eden; distance inexpressible END
BEGIN NOW By numbers that have name. But this I urge, END
BEGIN NOW Admitting motion in the Heavens, to show END
BEGIN NOW Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved; END
BEGIN NOW Not that I so affirm, though so it seem END
BEGIN NOW To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth. END
BEGIN NOW God, to remove his ways from human sense, END
BEGIN NOW Placed Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight, END
BEGIN NOW If it presume, might err in things too high, END
BEGIN NOW And no advantage gain. What if the sun END
BEGIN NOW Be center to the world; and other stars, END
BEGIN NOW By his attractive virtue and their own END
BEGIN NOW Incited, dance about him various rounds? END
BEGIN NOW Their wandering course now high, now low, then hid, END
BEGIN NOW Progressive, retrograde, or standing still, END
BEGIN NOW In six thou seest; and what if seventh to these END
BEGIN NOW The planet earth, so stedfast though she seem, END
BEGIN NOW Insensibly three different motions move? END
BEGIN NOW Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe, END
BEGIN NOW Moved contrary with thwart obliquities; END
BEGIN NOW Or save the sun his labour, and that swift END
BEGIN NOW Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed, END
BEGIN NOW Invisible else above all stars, the wheel END
BEGIN NOW Of day and night; which needs not thy belief, END
BEGIN NOW If earth, industrious of herself, fetch day END
BEGIN NOW Travelling east, and with her part averse END
BEGIN NOW From the sun's beam meet night, her other part END
BEGIN NOW Still luminous by his ray. What if that light, END
BEGIN NOW Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air, END
BEGIN NOW To the terrestrial moon be as a star, END
BEGIN NOW Enlightening her by day, as she by night END
BEGIN NOW This earth? reciprocal, if land be there, END
BEGIN NOW Fields and inhabitants: Her spots thou seest END
BEGIN NOW As clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce END
BEGIN NOW Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat END
BEGIN NOW Allotted there; and other suns perhaps, END
BEGIN NOW With their attendant moons, thou wilt descry, END
BEGIN NOW Communicating male and female light; END
BEGIN NOW Which two great sexes animate the world, END
BEGIN NOW Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live. END
BEGIN NOW For such vast room in Nature unpossessed END
BEGIN NOW By living soul, desart and desolate, END
BEGIN NOW Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute END
BEGIN NOW Each orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far END
BEGIN NOW Down to this habitable, which returns END
BEGIN NOW Light back to them, is obvious to dispute. END
BEGIN NOW But whether thus these things, or whether not; END
BEGIN NOW But whether the sun, predominant in Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Rise on the earth; or earth rise on the sun; END
BEGIN NOW He from the east his flaming road begin; END
BEGIN NOW Or she from west her silent course advance, END
BEGIN NOW With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps END
BEGIN NOW On her soft axle, while she paces even, END
BEGIN NOW And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along; END
BEGIN NOW Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid; END
BEGIN NOW Leave them to God above; him serve, and fear! END
BEGIN NOW Of other creatures, as him pleases best, END
BEGIN NOW Wherever placed, let him dispose; joy thou END
BEGIN NOW In what he gives to thee, this Paradise END
BEGIN NOW And thy fair Eve; Heaven is for thee too high END
BEGIN NOW To know what passes there; be lowly wise: END
BEGIN NOW Think only what concerns thee, and thy being; END
BEGIN NOW Dream not of other worlds, what creatures there END
BEGIN NOW Live, in what state, condition, or degree; END
BEGIN NOW Contented that thus far hath been revealed END
BEGIN NOW Not of Earth only, but of highest Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied. END
BEGIN NOW How fully hast thou satisfied me, pure END
BEGIN NOW Intelligence of Heaven, Angel serene! END
BEGIN NOW And, freed from intricacies, taught to live END
BEGIN NOW The easiest way; nor with perplexing thoughts END
BEGIN NOW To interrupt the sweet of life, from which END
BEGIN NOW God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares, END
BEGIN NOW And not molest us; unless we ourselves END
BEGIN NOW Seek them with wandering thoughts, and notions vain. END
BEGIN NOW But apt the mind or fancy is to rove END
BEGIN NOW Unchecked, and of her roving is no end; END
BEGIN NOW Till warned, or by experience taught, she learn, END
BEGIN NOW That, not to know at large of things remote END
BEGIN NOW From use, obscure and subtle; but, to know END
BEGIN NOW That which before us lies in daily life, END
BEGIN NOW Is the prime wisdom: What is more, is fume, END
BEGIN NOW Or emptiness, or fond impertinence: END
BEGIN NOW And renders us, in things that most concern, END
BEGIN NOW Unpractised, unprepared, and still to seek. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore from this high pitch let us descend END
BEGIN NOW A lower flight, and speak of things at hand END
BEGIN NOW Useful; whence, haply, mention may arise END
BEGIN NOW Of something not unseasonable to ask, END
BEGIN NOW By sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned. END
BEGIN NOW Thee I have heard relating what was done END
BEGIN NOW Ere my remembrance: now, hear me relate END
BEGIN NOW My story, which perhaps thou hast not heard; END
BEGIN NOW And day is not yet spent; till then thou seest END
BEGIN NOW How subtly to detain thee I devise; END
BEGIN NOW Inviting thee to hear while I relate; END
BEGIN NOW Fond! were it not in hope of thy reply: END
BEGIN NOW For, while I sit with thee, I seem in Heaven; END
BEGIN NOW And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear END
BEGIN NOW Than fruits of palm-tree pleasantest to thirst END
BEGIN NOW And hunger both, from labour, at the hour END
BEGIN NOW Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill, END
BEGIN NOW Though pleasant; but thy words, with grace divine END
BEGIN NOW Imbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek. END
BEGIN NOW Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, END
BEGIN NOW Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee END
BEGIN NOW Abundantly his gifts hath also poured END
BEGIN NOW Inward and outward both, his image fair: END
BEGIN NOW Speaking, or mute, all comeliness and grace END
BEGIN NOW Attends thee; and each word, each motion, forms; END
BEGIN NOW Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth END
BEGIN NOW Than of our fellow-servant, and inquire END
BEGIN NOW Gladly into the ways of God with Man: END
BEGIN NOW For God, we see, hath honoured thee, and set END
BEGIN NOW On Man his equal love: Say therefore on; END
BEGIN NOW For I that day was absent, as befel, END
BEGIN NOW Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, END
BEGIN NOW Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell; END
BEGIN NOW Squared in full legion (such command we had) END
BEGIN NOW To see that none thence issued forth a spy, END
BEGIN NOW Or enemy, while God was in his work; END
BEGIN NOW Lest he, incensed at such eruption bold, END
BEGIN NOW Destruction with creation might have mixed. END
BEGIN NOW Not that they durst without his leave attempt; END
BEGIN NOW But us he sends upon his high behests END
BEGIN NOW For state, as Sovran King; and to inure END
BEGIN NOW Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut, END
BEGIN NOW The dismal gates, and barricadoed strong; END
BEGIN NOW But long ere our approaching heard within END
BEGIN NOW Noise, other than the sound of dance or song, END
BEGIN NOW Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage. END
BEGIN NOW Glad we returned up to the coasts of light END
BEGIN NOW Ere sabbath-evening: so we had in charge. END
BEGIN NOW But thy relation now; for I attend, END
BEGIN NOW Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. END
BEGIN NOW For Man to tell how human life began END
BEGIN NOW Is hard; for who himself beginning knew END
BEGIN NOW Desire with thee still longer to converse END
BEGIN NOW Induced me. As new waked from soundest sleep, END
BEGIN NOW Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid, END
BEGIN NOW In balmy sweat; which with his beams the sun END
BEGIN NOW Soon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed. END
BEGIN NOW Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned, END
BEGIN NOW And gazed a while the ample sky; till, raised END
BEGIN NOW By quick instinctive motion, up I sprung, END
BEGIN NOW As thitherward endeavouring, and upright END
BEGIN NOW Stood on my feet: about me round I saw END
BEGIN NOW Hill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains, END
BEGIN NOW And liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these, END
BEGIN NOW Creatures that lived and moved, and walked, or flew; END
BEGIN NOW Birds on the branches warbling; all things smiled; END
BEGIN NOW With fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed. END
BEGIN NOW Myself I then perused, and limb by limb END
BEGIN NOW Surveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran END
BEGIN NOW With supple joints, as lively vigour led: END
BEGIN NOW But who I was, or where, or from what cause, END
BEGIN NOW Knew not; to speak I tried, and forthwith spake; END
BEGIN NOW My tongue obeyed, and readily could name END
BEGIN NOW Whate'er I saw. Thou Sun, said I, fair light, END
BEGIN NOW And thou enlightened Earth, so fresh and gay, END
BEGIN NOW And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, END
BEGIN NOW Tell, if ye saw, how I came thus, how here?-- END
BEGIN NOW Not of myself;--by some great Maker then, END
BEGIN NOW In goodness and in power pre-eminent: END
BEGIN NOW Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, END
BEGIN NOW From whom I have that thus I move and live, END
BEGIN NOW And feel that I am happier than I know.-- END
BEGIN NOW While thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither, END
BEGIN NOW From where I first drew air, and first beheld END
BEGIN NOW This happy light; when, answer none returned, END
BEGIN NOW On a green shady bank, profuse of flowers, END
BEGIN NOW Pensive I sat me down: There gentle sleep END
BEGIN NOW First found me, and with soft oppression seised END
BEGIN NOW My droused sense, untroubled, though I thought END
BEGIN NOW I then was passing to my former state END
BEGIN NOW Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: END
BEGIN NOW When suddenly stood at my head a dream, END
BEGIN NOW Whose inward apparition gently moved END
BEGIN NOW My fancy to believe I yet had being, END
BEGIN NOW And lived: One came, methought, of shape divine, END
BEGIN NOW And said, "Thy mansion wants thee, Adam; rise, END
BEGIN NOW First Man, of men innumerable ordained END
BEGIN NOW First Father! called by thee, I come thy guide END
BEGIN NOW To the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared. END
BEGIN NOW So saying, by the hand he took me raised, END
BEGIN NOW And over fields and waters, as in air END
BEGIN NOW Smooth-sliding without step, last led me up END
BEGIN NOW A woody mountain; whose high top was plain, END
BEGIN NOW A circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees END
BEGIN NOW Planted, with walks, and bowers; that what I saw END
BEGIN NOW Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed. Each tree, END
BEGIN NOW Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye END
BEGIN NOW Tempting, stirred in me sudden appetite END
BEGIN NOW To pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found END
BEGIN NOW Before mine eyes all real, as the dream END
BEGIN NOW Had lively shadowed: Here had new begun END
BEGIN NOW My wandering, had not he, who was my guide END
BEGIN NOW Up hither, from among the trees appeared, END
BEGIN NOW Presence Divine. Rejoicing, but with awe, END
BEGIN NOW In adoration at his feet I fell END
BEGIN NOW Submiss: He reared me, and "Whom thou soughtest I am, END
BEGIN NOW Said mildly, "Author of all this thou seest END
BEGIN NOW Above, or round about thee, or beneath. END
BEGIN NOW This Paradise I give thee, count it thine END
BEGIN NOW To till and keep, and of the fruit to eat: END
BEGIN NOW Of every tree that in the garden grows END
BEGIN NOW Eat freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: END
BEGIN NOW But of the tree whose operation brings END
BEGIN NOW Knowledge of good and ill, which I have set END
BEGIN NOW The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith, END
BEGIN NOW Amid the garden by the tree of life, END
BEGIN NOW Remember what I warn thee, shun to taste, END
BEGIN NOW And shun the bitter consequence: for know, END
BEGIN NOW The day thou eatest thereof, my sole command END
BEGIN NOW Transgressed, inevitably thou shalt die, END
BEGIN NOW From that day mortal; and this happy state END
BEGIN NOW Shalt lose, expelled from hence into a world END
BEGIN NOW Of woe and sorrow." Sternly he pronounced END
BEGIN NOW The rigid interdiction, which resounds END
BEGIN NOW Yet dreadful in mine ear, though in my choice END
BEGIN NOW Not to incur; but soon his clear aspect END
BEGIN NOW Returned, and gracious purpose thus renewed. END
BEGIN NOW Not only these fair bounds, but all the Earth END
BEGIN NOW To thee and to thy race I give; as lords END
BEGIN NOW Possess it, and all things that therein live, END
BEGIN NOW Or live in sea, or air; beast, fish, and fowl. END
BEGIN NOW In sign whereof, each bird and beast behold END
BEGIN NOW After their kinds; I bring them to receive END
BEGIN NOW From thee their names, and pay thee fealty END
BEGIN NOW With low subjection; understand the same END
BEGIN NOW Of fish within their watery residence, END
BEGIN NOW Not hither summoned, since they cannot change END
BEGIN NOW Their element, to draw the thinner air. END
BEGIN NOW As thus he spake, each bird and beast behold END
BEGIN NOW Approaching two and two; these cowering low END
BEGIN NOW With blandishment; each bird stooped on his wing. END
BEGIN NOW I named them, as they passed, and understood END
BEGIN NOW Their nature, with such knowledge God endued END
BEGIN NOW My sudden apprehension: But in these END
BEGIN NOW I found not what methought I wanted still; END
BEGIN NOW And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed. END
BEGIN NOW O, by what name, for thou above all these, END
BEGIN NOW Above mankind, or aught than mankind higher, END
BEGIN NOW Surpassest far my naming; how may I END
BEGIN NOW Adore thee, Author of this universe, END
BEGIN NOW And all this good to man? for whose well being END
BEGIN NOW So amply, and with hands so liberal, END
BEGIN NOW Thou hast provided all things: But with me END
BEGIN NOW I see not who partakes. In solitude END
BEGIN NOW What happiness, who can enjoy alone, END
BEGIN NOW Or, all enjoying, what contentment find? END
BEGIN NOW Thus I presumptuous; and the Vision bright, END
BEGIN NOW As with a smile more brightened, thus replied. END
BEGIN NOW What callest thou solitude? Is not the Earth END
BEGIN NOW With various living creatures, and the air END
BEGIN NOW Replenished, and all these at thy command END
BEGIN NOW To come and play before thee? Knowest thou not END
BEGIN NOW Their language and their ways? They also know, END
BEGIN NOW And reason not contemptibly: With these END
BEGIN NOW Find pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Universal Lord, and seemed END
BEGIN NOW So ordering: I, with leave of speech implored, END
BEGIN NOW And humble deprecation, thus replied. END
BEGIN NOW Let not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power; END
BEGIN NOW My Maker, be propitious while I speak. END
BEGIN NOW Hast thou not made me here thy substitute, END
BEGIN NOW And these inferiour far beneath me set? END
BEGIN NOW Among unequals what society END
BEGIN NOW Can sort, what harmony, or true delight? END
BEGIN NOW Which must be mutual, in proportion due END
BEGIN NOW Given and received; but, in disparity END
BEGIN NOW The one intense, the other still remiss, END
BEGIN NOW Cannot well suit with either, but soon prove END
BEGIN NOW Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak END
BEGIN NOW Such as I seek, fit to participate END
BEGIN NOW All rational delight: wherein the brute END
BEGIN NOW Cannot be human consort: They rejoice END
BEGIN NOW Each with their kind, lion with lioness; END
BEGIN NOW So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined: END
BEGIN NOW Much less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl END
BEGIN NOW So well converse, nor with the ox the ape; END
BEGIN NOW Worse then can man with beast, and least of all. END
BEGIN NOW Whereto the Almighty answered, not displeased. END
BEGIN NOW A nice and subtle happiness, I see, END
BEGIN NOW Thou to thyself proposest, in the choice END
BEGIN NOW Of thy associates, Adam! and wilt taste END
BEGIN NOW No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary. END
BEGIN NOW What thinkest thou then of me, and this my state? END
BEGIN NOW Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed END
BEGIN NOW Of happiness, or not? who am alone END
BEGIN NOW From all eternity; for none I know END
BEGIN NOW Second to me or like, equal much less. END
BEGIN NOW How have I then with whom to hold converse, END
BEGIN NOW Save with the creatures which I made, and those END
BEGIN NOW To me inferiour, infinite descents END
BEGIN NOW Beneath what other creatures are to thee? END
BEGIN NOW He ceased; I lowly answered. To attain END
BEGIN NOW The highth and depth of thy eternal ways END
BEGIN NOW All human thoughts come short, Supreme of things! END
BEGIN NOW Thou in thyself art perfect, and in thee END
BEGIN NOW Is no deficience found: Not so is Man, END
BEGIN NOW But in degree; the cause of his desire END
BEGIN NOW By conversation with his like to help END
BEGIN NOW Or solace his defects. No need that thou END
BEGIN NOW Shouldst propagate, already Infinite; END
BEGIN NOW And through all numbers absolute, though One: END
BEGIN NOW But Man by number is to manifest END
BEGIN NOW His single imperfection, and beget END
BEGIN NOW Like of his like, his image multiplied, END
BEGIN NOW In unity defective; which requires END
BEGIN NOW Collateral love, and dearest amity. END
BEGIN NOW Thou in thy secresy although alone, END
BEGIN NOW Best with thyself accompanied, seekest not END
BEGIN NOW Social communication; yet, so pleased, END
BEGIN NOW Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt END
BEGIN NOW Of union or communion, deified: END
BEGIN NOW I, by conversing, cannot these erect END
BEGIN NOW From prone; nor in their ways complacence find. END
BEGIN NOW Thus I emboldened spake, and freedom used END
BEGIN NOW Permissive, and acceptance found; which gained END
BEGIN NOW This answer from the gracious Voice Divine. END
BEGIN NOW Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased; END
BEGIN NOW And find thee knowing, not of beasts alone, END
BEGIN NOW Which thou hast rightly named, but of thyself; END
BEGIN NOW Expressing well the spirit within thee free, END
BEGIN NOW My image, not imparted to the brute; END
BEGIN NOW Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee END
BEGIN NOW Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike; END
BEGIN NOW And be so minded still: I, ere thou spakest, END
BEGIN NOW Knew it not good for Man to be alone; END
BEGIN NOW And no such company as then thou sawest END
BEGIN NOW Intended thee; for trial only brought, END
BEGIN NOW To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet: END
BEGIN NOW What next I bring shall please thee, be assured, END
BEGIN NOW Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self, END
BEGIN NOW Thy wish exactly to thy heart's desire. END
BEGIN NOW He ended, or I heard no more; for now END
BEGIN NOW My earthly by his heavenly overpowered, END
BEGIN NOW Which it had long stood under, strained to the highth END
BEGIN NOW In that celestial colloquy sublime, END
BEGIN NOW As with an object that excels the sense END
BEGIN NOW Dazzled and spent, sunk down; and sought repair END
BEGIN NOW Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, called END
BEGIN NOW By Nature as in aid, and closed mine eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Mine eyes he closed, but open left the cell END
BEGIN NOW Of fancy, my internal sight; by which, END
BEGIN NOW Abstract as in a trance, methought I saw, END
BEGIN NOW Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape END
BEGIN NOW Still glorious before whom awake I stood: END
BEGIN NOW Who stooping opened my left side, and took END
BEGIN NOW From thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm, END
BEGIN NOW And life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, END
BEGIN NOW But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed: END
BEGIN NOW The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands; END
BEGIN NOW Under his forming hands a creature grew, END
BEGIN NOW Man-like, but different sex; so lovely fair, END
BEGIN NOW That what seemed fair in all the world, seemed now END
BEGIN NOW Mean, or in her summed up, in her contained END
BEGIN NOW And in her looks; which from that time infused END
BEGIN NOW Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, END
BEGIN NOW And into all things from her air inspired END
BEGIN NOW The spirit of love and amorous delight. END
BEGIN NOW She disappeared, and left me dark; I waked END
BEGIN NOW To find her, or for ever to deplore END
BEGIN NOW Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: END
BEGIN NOW When out of hope, behold her, not far off, END
BEGIN NOW Such as I saw her in my dream, adorned END
BEGIN NOW With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow END
BEGIN NOW To make her amiable: On she came, END
BEGIN NOW Led by her heavenly Maker, though unseen, END
BEGIN NOW And guided by his voice; nor uninformed END
BEGIN NOW Of nuptial sanctity, and marriage rites: END
BEGIN NOW Grace was in all her steps, Heaven in her eye, END
BEGIN NOW In every gesture dignity and love. END
BEGIN NOW I, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud. END
BEGIN NOW This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilled END
BEGIN NOW Thy words, Creator bounteous and benign, END
BEGIN NOW Giver of all things fair! but fairest this END
BEGIN NOW Of all thy gifts! nor enviest. I now see END
BEGIN NOW Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, myself END
BEGIN NOW Before me: Woman is her name; of Man END
BEGIN NOW Extracted: for this cause he shall forego END
BEGIN NOW Father and mother, and to his wife adhere; END
BEGIN NOW And they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul. END
BEGIN NOW She heard me thus; and though divinely brought, END
BEGIN NOW Yet innocence, and virgin modesty, END
BEGIN NOW Her virtue, and the conscience of her worth, END
BEGIN NOW That would be wooed, and not unsought be won, END
BEGIN NOW Not obvious, not obtrusive, but, retired, END
BEGIN NOW The more desirable; or, to say all, END
BEGIN NOW Nature herself, though pure of sinful thought, END
BEGIN NOW Wrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned: END
BEGIN NOW I followed her; she what was honour knew, END
BEGIN NOW And with obsequious majesty approved END
BEGIN NOW My pleaded reason. To the nuptial bower END
BEGIN NOW I led her blushing like the morn: All Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW And happy constellations, on that hour END
BEGIN NOW Shed their selectest influence; the Earth END
BEGIN NOW Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill; END
BEGIN NOW Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs END
BEGIN NOW Whispered it to the woods, and from their wings END
BEGIN NOW Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub, END
BEGIN NOW Disporting, till the amorous bird of night END
BEGIN NOW Sung spousal, and bid haste the evening-star END
BEGIN NOW On his hill top, to light the bridal lamp. END
BEGIN NOW Thus have I told thee all my state, and brought END
BEGIN NOW My story to the sum of earthly bliss, END
BEGIN NOW Which I enjoy; and must confess to find END
BEGIN NOW In all things else delight indeed, but such END
BEGIN NOW As, used or not, works in the mind no change, END
BEGIN NOW Nor vehement desire; these delicacies END
BEGIN NOW I mean of taste, sight, smell, herbs, fruits, and flowers, END
BEGIN NOW Walks, and the melody of birds: but here END
BEGIN NOW Far otherwise, transported I behold, END
BEGIN NOW Transported touch; here passion first I felt, END
BEGIN NOW Commotion strange! in all enjoyments else END
BEGIN NOW Superiour and unmoved; here only weak END
BEGIN NOW Against the charm of Beauty's powerful glance. END
BEGIN NOW Or Nature failed in me, and left some part END
BEGIN NOW Not proof enough such object to sustain; END
BEGIN NOW Or, from my side subducting, took perhaps END
BEGIN NOW More than enough; at least on her bestowed END
BEGIN NOW Too much of ornament, in outward show END
BEGIN NOW Elaborate, of inward less exact. END
BEGIN NOW For well I understand in the prime end END

BEGIN NOW Her loveliness, so absolute she seems END
BEGIN NOW And in herself complete, so well to know END
BEGIN NOW Her own, that what she wills to do or say, END

BEGIN NOW Degraded; Wisdom in discourse with her END

BEGIN NOW As one intended first, not after made END
BEGIN NOW Occasionally; and, to consummate all, END
BEGIN NOW Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat END
BEGIN NOW Build in her loveliest, and create an awe END

BEGIN NOW To whom the Angel with contracted brow. END
BEGIN NOW Accuse not Nature, she hath done her part; END
BEGIN NOW Do thou but thine; and be not diffident END
BEGIN NOW Of Wisdom; she deserts thee not, if thou END
BEGIN NOW Dismiss not her, when most thou needest her nigh, END
BEGIN NOW By attributing overmuch to things END
BEGIN NOW Less excellent, as thou thyself perceivest. END
BEGIN NOW For, what admirest thou, what transports thee so, END
BEGIN NOW An outside? fair, no doubt, and worthy well END

BEGIN NOW Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right END
BEGIN NOW Well managed; of that skill the more thou knowest, END
BEGIN NOW The more she will acknowledge thee her head, END
BEGIN NOW And to realities yield all her shows: END
BEGIN NOW Made so adorn for thy delight the more, END
BEGIN NOW So awful, that with honour thou mayest love END
BEGIN NOW Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise. END
BEGIN NOW But if the sense of touch, whereby mankind END

BEGIN NOW The thoughts, and heart enlarges; hath his seat END

BEGIN NOW Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose END

BEGIN NOW Who meet with various objects, from the sense END

BEGIN NOW Approve the best, and follow what I approve. END
BEGIN NOW To love, thou blamest me not; for Love, thou sayest, END
BEGIN NOW Leads up to Heaven, is both the way and guide; END
BEGIN NOW Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask: END
BEGIN NOW Love not the heavenly Spirits, and how their love END
BEGIN NOW Express they? by looks only? or do they mix END
BEGIN NOW Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Angel, with a smile that glowed END
BEGIN NOW Celestial rosy red, Love's proper hue, END
BEGIN NOW Answered. Let it suffice thee that thou knowest END
BEGIN NOW Us happy, and without love no happiness. END
BEGIN NOW Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest, END
BEGIN NOW (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy END
BEGIN NOW In eminence; and obstacle find none END
BEGIN NOW Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars; END
BEGIN NOW Easier than air with air, if Spirits embrace, END
BEGIN NOW Total they mix, union of pure with pure END
BEGIN NOW Desiring, nor restrained conveyance need, END

BEGIN NOW But I can now no more; the parting sun END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the Earth's green Cape and verdant Isles END

BEGIN NOW Be strong, live happy, and love! But, first of all, END
BEGIN NOW Him, whom to love is to obey, and keep END
BEGIN NOW His great command; take heed lest passion sway END
BEGIN NOW Thy judgement to do aught, which else free will END
BEGIN NOW Would not admit: thine, and of all thy sons, END
BEGIN NOW The weal or woe in thee is placed; beware! END
BEGIN NOW I in thy persevering shall rejoice, END
BEGIN NOW And all the Blest: Stand fast; to stand or fall END
BEGIN NOW Free in thine own arbitrement it lies. END
BEGIN NOW Perfect within, no outward aid require; END
BEGIN NOW And all temptation to transgress repel. END
BEGIN NOW So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus END
BEGIN NOW Followed with benediction. Since to part, END
BEGIN NOW Go, heavenly guest, ethereal Messenger, END
BEGIN NOW Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore! END
BEGIN NOW Gentle to me and affable hath been END
BEGIN NOW Thy condescension, and shall be honoured ever END
BEGIN NOW With grateful memory: Thou to mankind END
BEGIN NOW Be good and friendly still, and oft return! END
BEGIN NOW So parted they; the Angel up to Heaven END
BEGIN NOW From the thick shade, and Adam to his bower. END
BEGIN NOW No more of talk where God or Angel guest END
BEGIN NOW With Man, as with his friend, familiar us'd, END
BEGIN NOW To sit indulgent, and with him partake END
BEGIN NOW Rural repast; permitting him the while END
BEGIN NOW Venial discourse unblam'd. I now must change END
BEGIN NOW Those notes to tragick; foul distrust, and breach END
BEGIN NOW Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt, END
BEGIN NOW And disobedience: on the part of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Now alienated, distance and distaste, END
BEGIN NOW Anger and just rebuke, and judgement given, END
BEGIN NOW That brought into this world a world of woe, END
BEGIN NOW Sin and her shadow Death, and Misery END
BEGIN NOW Death's harbinger: Sad task! yet argument END
BEGIN NOW Not less but more heroick than the wrath END
BEGIN NOW Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued END
BEGIN NOW Thrice fugitive about Troy wall; or rage END
BEGIN NOW Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous'd; END
BEGIN NOW Or Neptune's ire, or Juno's, that so long END

BEGIN NOW If answerable style I can obtain END
BEGIN NOW Of my celestial patroness, who deigns END
BEGIN NOW Her nightly visitation unimplor'd, END
BEGIN NOW And dictates to me slumbering; or inspires END
BEGIN NOW Easy my unpremeditated verse: END
BEGIN NOW Since first this subject for heroick song END
BEGIN NOW Pleas'd me long choosing, and beginning late; END
BEGIN NOW Not sedulous by nature to indite END
BEGIN NOW Wars, hitherto the only argument END
BEGIN NOW Heroick deem'd chief mastery to dissect END
BEGIN NOW With long and tedious havock fabled knights END
BEGIN NOW In battles feign'd; the better fortitude END
BEGIN NOW Of patience and heroick martyrdom END
BEGIN NOW Unsung; or to describe races and games, END
BEGIN NOW Or tilting furniture, imblazon'd shields, END
BEGIN NOW Impresses quaint, caparisons and steeds, END
BEGIN NOW Bases and tinsel trappings, gorgeous knights END
BEGIN NOW At joust and tournament; then marshall'd feast END
BEGIN NOW Serv'd up in hall with sewers and seneshals; END
BEGIN NOW The skill of artifice or office mean, END
BEGIN NOW Not that which justly gives heroick name END
BEGIN NOW To person, or to poem. Me, of these END
BEGIN NOW Nor skill'd nor studious, higher argument END
BEGIN NOW Remains; sufficient of itself to raise END
BEGIN NOW That name, unless an age too late, or cold END
BEGIN NOW Climate, or years, damp my intended wing END
BEGIN NOW Depress'd; and much they may, if all be mine, END
BEGIN NOW Not hers, who brings it nightly to my ear. END
BEGIN NOW The sun was sunk, and after him the star END
BEGIN NOW Of Hesperus, whose office is to bring END
BEGIN NOW Twilight upon the earth, short arbiter END
BEGIN NOW 'Twixt day and night, and now from end to end END
BEGIN NOW Night's hemisphere had veil'd the horizon round: END
BEGIN NOW When satan, who late fled before the threats END
BEGIN NOW Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improv'd END
BEGIN NOW In meditated fraud and malice, bent END
BEGIN NOW On Man's destruction, maugre what might hap END
BEGIN NOW Of heavier on himself, fearless returned END
BEGIN NOW By night he fled, and at midnight returned END
BEGIN NOW From compassing the earth; cautious of day, END
BEGIN NOW Since Uriel, regent of the sun, descried END
BEGIN NOW His entrance, and foreworned the Cherubim END
BEGIN NOW That kept their watch; thence full of anguish driven, END
BEGIN NOW The space of seven continued nights he rode END
BEGIN NOW With darkness; thrice the equinoctial line END
BEGIN NOW He circled; four times crossed the car of night END
BEGIN NOW From pole to pole, traversing each colure; END
BEGIN NOW On the eighth returned; and, on the coast averse END
BEGIN NOW From entrance or Cherubick watch, by stealth END
BEGIN NOW Found unsuspected way. There was a place, END
BEGIN NOW Now not, though sin, not time, first wrought the change, END
BEGIN NOW Where Tigris, at the foot of Paradise, END
BEGIN NOW Into a gulf shot under ground, till part END
BEGIN NOW Rose up a fountain by the tree of life: END
BEGIN NOW In with the river sunk, and with it rose END
BEGIN NOW Satan, involved in rising mist; then sought END
BEGIN NOW Where to lie hid; sea he had searched, and land, END
BEGIN NOW From Eden over Pontus and the pool END
BEGIN NOW Maeotis, up beyond the river Ob; END
BEGIN NOW Downward as far antarctick; and in length, END
BEGIN NOW West from Orontes to the ocean barred END
BEGIN NOW At Darien; thence to the land where flows END
BEGIN NOW Ganges and Indus: Thus the orb he roamed END
BEGIN NOW With narrow search; and with inspection deep END
BEGIN NOW Considered every creature, which of all END
BEGIN NOW Most opportune might serve his wiles; and found END
BEGIN NOW The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field. END
BEGIN NOW Him after long debate, irresolute END
BEGIN NOW Of thoughts revolved, his final sentence chose END
BEGIN NOW Fit vessel, fittest imp of fraud, in whom END
BEGIN NOW To enter, and his dark suggestions hide END
BEGIN NOW From sharpest sight: for, in the wily snake END
BEGIN NOW Whatever sleights, none would suspicious mark, END
BEGIN NOW As from his wit and native subtlety END
BEGIN NOW Proceeding; which, in other beasts observed, END
BEGIN NOW Doubt might beget of diabolick power END
BEGIN NOW Active within, beyond the sense of brute. END
BEGIN NOW Thus he resolved, but first from inward grief END
BEGIN NOW His bursting passion into plaints thus poured. END
BEGIN NOW More justly, seat worthier of Gods, as built END
BEGIN NOW With second thoughts, reforming what was old! END
BEGIN NOW O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred END
BEGIN NOW For what God, after better, worse would build? END
BEGIN NOW Terrestrial Heaven, danced round by other Heavens END
BEGIN NOW That shine, yet bear their bright officious lamps, END
BEGIN NOW Light above light, for thee alone, as seems, END
BEGIN NOW In thee concentring all their precious beams END
BEGIN NOW Of sacred influence! As God in Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Is center, yet extends to all; so thou, END
BEGIN NOW Centring, receivest from all those orbs: in thee, END
BEGIN NOW Not in themselves, all their known virtue appears END
BEGIN NOW Productive in herb, plant, and nobler birth END
BEGIN NOW Of creatures animate with gradual life END
BEGIN NOW Of growth, sense, reason, all summed up in Man. END
BEGIN NOW With what delight could I have walked thee round, END
BEGIN NOW If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange END
BEGIN NOW Of hill, and valley, rivers, woods, and plains, END
BEGIN NOW Now land, now sea and shores with forest crowned, END
BEGIN NOW Rocks, dens, and caves! But I in none of these END
BEGIN NOW Find place or refuge; and the more I see END
BEGIN NOW Pleasures about me, so much more I feel END
BEGIN NOW Torment within me, as from the hateful siege END
BEGIN NOW Of contraries: all good to me becomes END
BEGIN NOW Bane, and in Heaven much worse would be my state. END
BEGIN NOW But neither here seek I, no nor in Heaven END
BEGIN NOW To dwell, unless by mastering Heaven's Supreme; END
BEGIN NOW Nor hope to be myself less miserable END
BEGIN NOW By what I seek, but others to make such END
BEGIN NOW As I, though thereby worse to me redound: END
BEGIN NOW For only in destroying I find ease END
BEGIN NOW To my relentless thoughts; and, him destroyed, END
BEGIN NOW Or won to what may work his utter loss, END
BEGIN NOW For whom all this was made, all this will soon END
BEGIN NOW Follow, as to him linked in weal or woe; END
BEGIN NOW In woe then; that destruction wide may range: END
BEGIN NOW To me shall be the glory sole among END
BEGIN NOW The infernal Powers, in one day to have marred END
BEGIN NOW What he, Almighty styled, six nights and days END
BEGIN NOW Continued making; and who knows how long END
BEGIN NOW Before had been contriving? though perhaps END
BEGIN NOW Not longer than since I, in one night, freed END
BEGIN NOW From servitude inglorious well nigh half END
BEGIN NOW The angelick name, and thinner left the throng END
BEGIN NOW Of his adorers: He, to be avenged, END
BEGIN NOW And to repair his numbers thus impaired, END
BEGIN NOW Whether such virtue spent of old now failed END
BEGIN NOW More Angels to create, if they at least END
BEGIN NOW Are his created, or, to spite us more, END
BEGIN NOW Determined to advance into our room END
BEGIN NOW A creature formed of earth, and him endow, END
BEGIN NOW Exalted from so base original, END
BEGIN NOW With heavenly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed, END
BEGIN NOW He effected; Man he made, and for him built END
BEGIN NOW Magnificent this world, and earth his seat, END
BEGIN NOW Him lord pronounced; and, O indignity! END
BEGIN NOW Subjected to his service angel-wings, END
BEGIN NOW And flaming ministers to watch and tend END
BEGIN NOW Their earthly charge: Of these the vigilance END
BEGIN NOW I dread; and, to elude, thus wrapt in mist END
BEGIN NOW Of midnight vapour glide obscure, and pry END
BEGIN NOW In every bush and brake, where hap may find END
BEGIN NOW The serpent sleeping; in whose mazy folds END
BEGIN NOW To hide me, and the dark intent I bring. END
BEGIN NOW O foul descent! that I, who erst contended END
BEGIN NOW With Gods to sit the highest, am now constrained END
BEGIN NOW Into a beast; and, mixed with bestial slime, END
BEGIN NOW This essence to incarnate and imbrute, END
BEGIN NOW That to the highth of Deity aspired! END
BEGIN NOW But what will not ambition and revenge END
BEGIN NOW Descend to? Who aspires, must down as low END
BEGIN NOW As high he soared; obnoxious, first or last, END
BEGIN NOW To basest things. Revenge, at first though sweet, END
BEGIN NOW Bitter ere long, back on itself recoils: END
BEGIN NOW Let it; I reck not, so it light well aimed, END
BEGIN NOW Since higher I fall short, on him who next END
BEGIN NOW Provokes my envy, this new favourite END
BEGIN NOW Of Heaven, this man of clay, son of despite, END
BEGIN NOW Whom, us the more to spite, his Maker raised END
BEGIN NOW From dust: Spite then with spite is best repaid. END
BEGIN NOW So saying, through each thicket dank or dry, END
BEGIN NOW Like a black mist low-creeping, he held on END
BEGIN NOW His midnight-search, where soonest he might find END
BEGIN NOW The serpent; him fast-sleeping soon he found END
BEGIN NOW In labyrinth of many a round self-rolled, END
BEGIN NOW His head the midst, well stored with subtile wiles: END
BEGIN NOW Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den, END
BEGIN NOW Nor nocent yet; but, on the grassy herb, END
BEGIN NOW Fearless unfeared he slept: in at his mouth END
BEGIN NOW The Devil entered; and his brutal sense, END
BEGIN NOW In heart or head, possessing, soon inspired END
BEGIN NOW With act intelligential; but his sleep END
BEGIN NOW Disturbed not, waiting close the approach of morn. END
BEGIN NOW Now, when as sacred light began to dawn END
BEGIN NOW In Eden on the humid flowers, that breathed END
BEGIN NOW Their morning incense, when all things, that breathe, END
BEGIN NOW From the Earth's great altar send up silent praise END
BEGIN NOW To the Creator, and his nostrils fill END
BEGIN NOW With grateful smell, forth came the human pair, END
BEGIN NOW And joined their vocal worship to the quire END
BEGIN NOW Of creatures wanting voice; that done, partake END
BEGIN NOW The season prime for sweetest scents and airs: END
BEGIN NOW Then commune, how that day they best may ply END
BEGIN NOW Their growing work: for much their work out-grew END
BEGIN NOW The hands' dispatch of two gardening so wide, END
BEGIN NOW And Eve first to her husband thus began. END
BEGIN NOW Adam, well may we labour still to dress END
BEGIN NOW This garden, still to tend plant, herb, and flower, END
BEGIN NOW Our pleasant task enjoined; but, till more hands END
BEGIN NOW Aid us, the work under our labour grows, END
BEGIN NOW Luxurious by restraint; what we by day END
BEGIN NOW Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, END
BEGIN NOW One night or two with wanton growth derides END
BEGIN NOW Tending to wild. Thou therefore now advise, END
BEGIN NOW Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present: END
BEGIN NOW Let us divide our labours; thou, where choice END
BEGIN NOW Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind END
BEGIN NOW The woodbine round this arbour, or direct END
BEGIN NOW The clasping ivy where to climb; while I, END
BEGIN NOW In yonder spring of roses intermixed END
BEGIN NOW With myrtle, find what to redress till noon: END
BEGIN NOW For, while so near each other thus all day END
BEGIN NOW Our task we choose, what wonder if so near END
BEGIN NOW Looks intervene and smiles, or object new END
BEGIN NOW Casual discourse draw on; which intermits END
BEGIN NOW Our day's work, brought to little, though begun END
BEGIN NOW Early, and the hour of supper comes unearned? END
BEGIN NOW To whom mild answer Adam thus returned. END
BEGIN NOW Sole Eve, associate sole, to me beyond END
BEGIN NOW Compare above all living creatures dear! END
BEGIN NOW Well hast thou motioned, well thy thoughts employed, END
BEGIN NOW How we might best fulfil the work which here END
BEGIN NOW God hath assigned us; nor of me shalt pass END
BEGIN NOW Unpraised: for nothing lovelier can be found END
BEGIN NOW In woman, than to study houshold good, END
BEGIN NOW And good works in her husband to promote. END
BEGIN NOW Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed END
BEGIN NOW Labour, as to debar us when we need END
BEGIN NOW Refreshment, whether food, or talk between, END
BEGIN NOW Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse END
BEGIN NOW Of looks and smiles; for smiles from reason flow, END
BEGIN NOW To brute denied, and are of love the food; END
BEGIN NOW Love, not the lowest end of human life. END
BEGIN NOW For not to irksome toil, but to delight, END
BEGIN NOW He made us, and delight to reason joined. END
BEGIN NOW These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands END
BEGIN NOW Will keep from wilderness with ease, as wide END
BEGIN NOW As we need walk, till younger hands ere long END
BEGIN NOW Assist us; But, if much converse perhaps END
BEGIN NOW Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield: END
BEGIN NOW For solitude sometimes is best society, END
BEGIN NOW And short retirement urges sweet return. END
BEGIN NOW But other doubt possesses me, lest harm END
BEGIN NOW Befall thee severed from me; for thou knowest END
BEGIN NOW What hath been warned us, what malicious foe END
BEGIN NOW Envying our happiness, and of his own END
BEGIN NOW Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame END
BEGIN NOW By sly assault; and somewhere nigh at hand END
BEGIN NOW Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find END
BEGIN NOW His wish and best advantage, us asunder; END
BEGIN NOW Hopeless to circumvent us joined, where each END
BEGIN NOW To other speedy aid might lend at need: END
BEGIN NOW Whether his first design be to withdraw END
BEGIN NOW Our fealty from God, or to disturb END
BEGIN NOW Conjugal love, than which perhaps no bliss END
BEGIN NOW Enjoyed by us excites his envy more; END
BEGIN NOW Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side END
BEGIN NOW That gave thee being, still shades thee, and protects. END
BEGIN NOW The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, END
BEGIN NOW Safest and seemliest by her husband stays, END
BEGIN NOW Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the virgin majesty of Eve, END
BEGIN NOW As one who loves, and some unkindness meets, END
BEGIN NOW With sweet austere composure thus replied. END
BEGIN NOW Offspring of Heaven and Earth, and all Earth's Lord! END
BEGIN NOW That such an enemy we have, who seeks END
BEGIN NOW Our ruin, both by thee informed I learn, END
BEGIN NOW And from the parting Angel over-heard, END
BEGIN NOW As in a shady nook I stood behind, END
BEGIN NOW Just then returned at shut of evening flowers. END
BEGIN NOW But, that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt END
BEGIN NOW To God or thee, because we have a foe END
BEGIN NOW May tempt it, I expected not to hear. END
BEGIN NOW His violence thou fearest not, being such END
BEGIN NOW As we, not capable of death or pain, END
BEGIN NOW Can either not receive, or can repel. END
BEGIN NOW His fraud is then thy fear; which plain infers END
BEGIN NOW Thy equal fear, that my firm faith and love END
BEGIN NOW Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced; END
BEGIN NOW Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy breast, END
BEGIN NOW Adam, mis-thought of her to thee so dear? END
BEGIN NOW To whom with healing words Adam replied. END
BEGIN NOW Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve! END
BEGIN NOW For such thou art; from sin and blame entire: END
BEGIN NOW Not diffident of thee do I dissuade END
BEGIN NOW Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid END
BEGIN NOW The attempt itself, intended by our foe. END
BEGIN NOW For he who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses END
BEGIN NOW The tempted with dishonour foul; supposed END
BEGIN NOW Not incorruptible of faith, not proof END
BEGIN NOW Against temptation: Thou thyself with scorn END
BEGIN NOW And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong, END
BEGIN NOW Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, END
BEGIN NOW If such affront I labour to avert END
BEGIN NOW From thee alone, which on us both at once END
BEGIN NOW The enemy, though bold, will hardly dare; END
BEGIN NOW Or daring, first on me the assault shall light. END
BEGIN NOW Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; END
BEGIN NOW Subtle he needs must be, who could seduce END
BEGIN NOW Angels; nor think superfluous other's aid. END
BEGIN NOW I, from the influence of thy looks, receive END
BEGIN NOW Access in every virtue; in thy sight END
BEGIN NOW More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were END
BEGIN NOW Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, END
BEGIN NOW Shame to be overcome or over-reached, END
BEGIN NOW Would utmost vigour raise, and raised unite. END
BEGIN NOW Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel END
BEGIN NOW When I am present, and thy trial choose END
BEGIN NOW With me, best witness of thy virtue tried? END
BEGIN NOW So spake domestick Adam in his care END
BEGIN NOW And matrimonial love; but Eve, who thought END
BEGIN NOW Less attributed to her faith sincere, END
BEGIN NOW Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed. END
BEGIN NOW If this be our condition, thus to dwell END
BEGIN NOW In narrow circuit straitened by a foe, END
BEGIN NOW Subtle or violent, we not endued END
BEGIN NOW Single with like defence, wherever met; END
BEGIN NOW How are we happy, still in fear of harm? END
BEGIN NOW But harm precedes not sin: only our foe, END
BEGIN NOW Tempting, affronts us with his foul esteem END
BEGIN NOW Of our integrity: his foul esteem END
BEGIN NOW Sticks no dishonour on our front, but turns END
BEGIN NOW Foul on himself; then wherefore shunned or feared END
BEGIN NOW By us? who rather double honour gain END
BEGIN NOW From his surmise proved false; find peace within, END
BEGIN NOW Favour from Heaven, our witness, from the event. END
BEGIN NOW And what is faith, love, virtue, unassayed END
BEGIN NOW Alone, without exteriour help sustained? END
BEGIN NOW Let us not then suspect our happy state END
BEGIN NOW Left so imperfect by the Maker wise, END
BEGIN NOW As not secure to single or combined. END
BEGIN NOW Frail is our happiness, if this be so, END
BEGIN NOW And Eden were no Eden, thus exposed. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Adam fervently replied. END
BEGIN NOW O Woman, best are all things as the will END
BEGIN NOW Of God ordained them: His creating hand END
BEGIN NOW Nothing imperfect or deficient left END
BEGIN NOW Of all that he created, much less Man, END
BEGIN NOW Or aught that might his happy state secure, END
BEGIN NOW Secure from outward force; within himself END
BEGIN NOW The danger lies, yet lies within his power: END
BEGIN NOW Against his will he can receive no harm. END
BEGIN NOW But God left free the will; for what obeys END
BEGIN NOW Reason, is free; and Reason he made right, END
BEGIN NOW But bid her well be ware, and still erect; END
BEGIN NOW Lest, by some fair-appearing good surprised, END
BEGIN NOW She dictate false; and mis-inform the will END
BEGIN NOW To do what God expressly hath forbid. END
BEGIN NOW Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoins, END
BEGIN NOW That I should mind thee oft; and mind thou me. END
BEGIN NOW Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve; END
BEGIN NOW Since Reason not impossibly may meet END
BEGIN NOW Some specious object by the foe suborned, END
BEGIN NOW And fall into deception unaware, END
BEGIN NOW Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warned. END
BEGIN NOW Seek not temptation then, which to avoid END
BEGIN NOW Were better, and most likely if from me END
BEGIN NOW Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought. END
BEGIN NOW Wouldst thou approve thy constancy, approve END
BEGIN NOW First thy obedience; the other who can know, END
BEGIN NOW Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? END
BEGIN NOW But, if thou think, trial unsought may find END
BEGIN NOW Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest, END
BEGIN NOW Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; END
BEGIN NOW Go in thy native innocence, rely END
BEGIN NOW On what thou hast of virtue; summon all! END
BEGIN NOW For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the patriarch of mankind; but Eve END
BEGIN NOW Persisted; yet submiss, though last, replied. END
BEGIN NOW With thy permission then, and thus forewarned END
BEGIN NOW Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words END
BEGIN NOW Touched only; that our trial, when least sought, END
BEGIN NOW May find us both perhaps far less prepared, END
BEGIN NOW The willinger I go, nor much expect END
BEGIN NOW A foe so proud will first the weaker seek; END
BEGIN NOW So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. END
BEGIN NOW Thus saying, from her husband's hand her hand END
BEGIN NOW Soft she withdrew; and, like a Wood-Nymph light, END
BEGIN NOW Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's train, END
BEGIN NOW Betook her to the groves; but Delia's self END
BEGIN NOW In gait surpassed, and Goddess-like deport, END
BEGIN NOW Though not as she with bow and quiver armed, END
BEGIN NOW But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude, END
BEGIN NOW Guiltless of fire, had formed, or Angels brought. END
BEGIN NOW To Pales, or Pomona, thus adorned, END
BEGIN NOW Likest she seemed, Pomona when she fled END
BEGIN NOW Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her prime, END
BEGIN NOW Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove. END
BEGIN NOW Her long with ardent look his eye pursued END
BEGIN NOW Delighted, but desiring more her stay. END
BEGIN NOW Oft he to her his charge of quick return END
BEGIN NOW Repeated; she to him as oft engaged END
BEGIN NOW To be returned by noon amid the bower, END
BEGIN NOW And all things in best order to invite END
BEGIN NOW Noontide repast, or afternoon's repose. END
BEGIN NOW O much deceived, much failing, hapless Eve, END
BEGIN NOW Of thy presumed return! event perverse! END
BEGIN NOW Thou never from that hour in Paradise END
BEGIN NOW Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose; END
BEGIN NOW Such ambush, hid among sweet flowers and shades, END
BEGIN NOW Waited with hellish rancour imminent END
BEGIN NOW To intercept thy way, or send thee back END
BEGIN NOW Despoiled of innocence, of faith, of bliss! END
BEGIN NOW For now, and since first break of dawn, the Fiend, END
BEGIN NOW Mere serpent in appearance, forth was come; END
BEGIN NOW And on his quest, where likeliest he might find END
BEGIN NOW The only two of mankind, but in them END
BEGIN NOW The whole included race, his purposed prey. END
BEGIN NOW In bower and field he sought, where any tuft END
BEGIN NOW Of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay, END
BEGIN NOW Their tendance, or plantation for delight; END
BEGIN NOW By fountain or by shady rivulet END
BEGIN NOW He sought them both, but wished his hap might find END
BEGIN NOW Eve separate; he wished, but not with hope END
BEGIN NOW Of what so seldom chanced; when to his wish, END
BEGIN NOW Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, END
BEGIN NOW Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood, END
BEGIN NOW Half spied, so thick the roses blushing round END
BEGIN NOW About her glowed, oft stooping to support END
BEGIN NOW Each flower of slender stalk, whose head, though gay END
BEGIN NOW Carnation, purple, azure, or specked with gold, END
BEGIN NOW Hung drooping unsustained; them she upstays END
BEGIN NOW Gently with myrtle band, mindless the while END
BEGIN NOW Herself, though fairest unsupported flower, END
BEGIN NOW From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh. END
BEGIN NOW Nearer he drew, and many a walk traversed END
BEGIN NOW Of stateliest covert, cedar, pine, or palm; END
BEGIN NOW Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen, END
BEGIN NOW Among thick-woven arborets, and flowers END
BEGIN NOW Imbordered on each bank, the hand of Eve: END
BEGIN NOW Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned END
BEGIN NOW Or of revived Adonis, or renowned END
BEGIN NOW Alcinous, host of old Laertes' son; END
BEGIN NOW Or that, not mystick, where the sapient king END
BEGIN NOW Much he the place admired, the person more. END
BEGIN NOW As one who long in populous city pent, END
BEGIN NOW Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air, END
BEGIN NOW Forth issuing on a summer's morn, to breathe END
BEGIN NOW Among the pleasant villages and farms END
BEGIN NOW Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight; END
BEGIN NOW The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine, END
BEGIN NOW Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound; END
BEGIN NOW If chance, with nymph-like step, fair virgin pass, END
BEGIN NOW What pleasing seemed, for her now pleases more; END
BEGIN NOW She most, and in her look sums all delight: END
BEGIN NOW Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold END
BEGIN NOW This flowery plat, the sweet recess of Eve END
BEGIN NOW Thus early, thus alone: Her heavenly form END
BEGIN NOW Angelick, but more soft, and feminine, END
BEGIN NOW Her graceful innocence, her every air END
BEGIN NOW Of gesture, or least action, overawed END
BEGIN NOW His malice, and with rapine sweet bereaved END
BEGIN NOW His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: END
BEGIN NOW That space the Evil-one abstracted stood END
BEGIN NOW From his own evil, and for the time remained END
BEGIN NOW Stupidly good; of enmity disarmed, END
BEGIN NOW Of guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge: END
BEGIN NOW But the hot Hell that always in him burns, END
BEGIN NOW Though in mid Heaven, soon ended his delight, END
BEGIN NOW And tortures him now more, the more he sees END
BEGIN NOW Of pleasure, not for him ordained: then soon END
BEGIN NOW Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts END
BEGIN NOW Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. END
BEGIN NOW Thoughts, whither have ye led me! with what sweet END
BEGIN NOW Compulsion thus transported, to forget END
BEGIN NOW What hither brought us! hate, not love; nor hope END
BEGIN NOW Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste END
BEGIN NOW Of pleasure; but all pleasure to destroy, END
BEGIN NOW Save what is in destroying; other joy END
BEGIN NOW To me is lost. Then, let me not let pass END
BEGIN NOW Occasion which now smiles; behold alone END
BEGIN NOW The woman, opportune to all attempts, END
BEGIN NOW Her husband, for I view far round, not nigh, END
BEGIN NOW Whose higher intellectual more I shun, END
BEGIN NOW And strength, of courage haughty, and of limb END
BEGIN NOW Heroick built, though of terrestrial mould; END
BEGIN NOW Foe not informidable! exempt from wound, END
BEGIN NOW I not; so much hath Hell debased, and pain END
BEGIN NOW Enfeebled me, to what I was in Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW She fair, divinely fair, fit love for Gods! END
BEGIN NOW Not terrible, though terrour be in love END
BEGIN NOW And beauty, not approached by stronger hate, END
BEGIN NOW Hate stronger, under show of love well feigned; END
BEGIN NOW The way which to her ruin now I tend. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the enemy of mankind, enclosed END
BEGIN NOW In serpent, inmate bad! and toward Eve END
BEGIN NOW Addressed his way: not with indented wave, END
BEGIN NOW Prone on the ground, as since; but on his rear, END
BEGIN NOW Circular base of rising folds, that towered END
BEGIN NOW Fold above fold, a surging maze! his head END
BEGIN NOW Crested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes; END
BEGIN NOW With burnished neck of verdant gold, erect END
BEGIN NOW Amidst his circling spires, that on the grass END
BEGIN NOW Floated redundant: pleasing was his shape END
BEGIN NOW And lovely; never since of serpent-kind END
BEGIN NOW Lovelier, not those that in Illyria changed, END
BEGIN NOW In Epidaurus; nor to which transformed END
BEGIN NOW Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline, was seen; END
BEGIN NOW He with Olympias; this with her who bore END
BEGIN NOW Scipio, the highth of Rome. With tract oblique END
BEGIN NOW At first, as one who sought access, but feared END
BEGIN NOW To interrupt, side-long he works his way. END
BEGIN NOW As when a ship, by skilful steersmen wrought END
BEGIN NOW Nigh river's mouth or foreland, where the wind END
BEGIN NOW Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail: END
BEGIN NOW So varied he, and of his tortuous train END
BEGIN NOW Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, END
BEGIN NOW To lure her eye; she, busied, heard the sound END
BEGIN NOW Of rusling leaves, but minded not, as used END
BEGIN NOW To such disport before her through the field, END
BEGIN NOW From every beast; more duteous at her call, END
BEGIN NOW Than at Circean call the herd disguised. END
BEGIN NOW He, bolder now, uncalled before her stood, END
BEGIN NOW But as in gaze admiring: oft he bowed END
BEGIN NOW His turret crest, and sleek enamelled neck, END
BEGIN NOW Fawning; and licked the ground whereon she trod. END
BEGIN NOW The eye of Eve to mark his play; he, glad END
BEGIN NOW Of her attention gained, with serpent-tongue END
BEGIN NOW Organick, or impulse of vocal air, END
BEGIN NOW His fraudulent temptation thus began. END
BEGIN NOW Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps END
BEGIN NOW Thou canst, who art sole wonder! much less arm END
BEGIN NOW Thy looks, the Heaven of mildness, with disdain, END
BEGIN NOW Displeased that I approach thee thus, and gaze END
BEGIN NOW Insatiate; I thus single; nor have feared END
BEGIN NOW Thy awful brow, more awful thus retired. END
BEGIN NOW Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair, END
BEGIN NOW Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine END
BEGIN NOW By gift, and thy celestial beauty adore END
BEGIN NOW With ravishment beheld! there best beheld, END
BEGIN NOW Where universally admired; but here END
BEGIN NOW In this enclosure wild, these beasts among, END
BEGIN NOW Beholders rude, and shallow to discern END
BEGIN NOW Half what in thee is fair, one man except, END
BEGIN NOW Who sees thee? and what is one? who should be seen END
BEGIN NOW A Goddess among Gods, adored and served END
BEGIN NOW By Angels numberless, thy daily train. END
BEGIN NOW So glozed the Tempter, and his proem tuned: END
BEGIN NOW Into the heart of Eve his words made way, END
BEGIN NOW Though at the voice much marvelling; at length, END
BEGIN NOW Not unamazed, she thus in answer spake. END
BEGIN NOW What may this mean? language of man pronounced END
BEGIN NOW By tongue of brute, and human sense expressed? END
BEGIN NOW The first, at least, of these I thought denied END
BEGIN NOW To beasts; whom God, on their creation-day, END
BEGIN NOW Created mute to all articulate sound: END
BEGIN NOW The latter I demur; for in their looks END
BEGIN NOW Much reason, and in their actions, oft appears. END
BEGIN NOW Thee, Serpent, subtlest beast of all the field END
BEGIN NOW I knew, but not with human voice endued; END
BEGIN NOW Redouble then this miracle, and say, END
BEGIN NOW How camest thou speakable of mute, and how END
BEGIN NOW To me so friendly grown above the rest END
BEGIN NOW Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? END
BEGIN NOW Say, for such wonder claims attention due. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied. END
BEGIN NOW Empress of this fair world, resplendent Eve! END
BEGIN NOW Easy to me it is to tell thee all END
BEGIN NOW What thou commandest; and right thou shouldst be obeyed: END
BEGIN NOW I was at first as other beasts that graze END
BEGIN NOW The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low, END
BEGIN NOW As was my food; nor aught but food discerned END
BEGIN NOW Or sex, and apprehended nothing high: END
BEGIN NOW Till, on a day roving the field, I chanced END
BEGIN NOW A goodly tree far distant to behold END
BEGIN NOW Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed, END
BEGIN NOW Ruddy and gold: I nearer drew to gaze; END
BEGIN NOW When from the boughs a savoury odour blown, END
BEGIN NOW Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense END
BEGIN NOW Than smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats END
BEGIN NOW Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even, END
BEGIN NOW Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play. END
BEGIN NOW To satisfy the sharp desire I had END
BEGIN NOW Of tasting those fair apples, I resolved END
BEGIN NOW Not to defer; hunger and thirst at once, END
BEGIN NOW Powerful persuaders, quickened at the scent END
BEGIN NOW Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen. END
BEGIN NOW About the mossy trunk I wound me soon; END
BEGIN NOW For, high from ground, the branches would require END
BEGIN NOW Thy utmost reach or Adam's: Round the tree END
BEGIN NOW All other beasts that saw, with like desire END
BEGIN NOW Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. END
BEGIN NOW Amid the tree now got, where plenty hung END
BEGIN NOW Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill END
BEGIN NOW I spared not; for, such pleasure till that hour, END
BEGIN NOW At feed or fountain, never had I found. END
BEGIN NOW Sated at length, ere long I might perceive END
BEGIN NOW Strange alteration in me, to degree END
BEGIN NOW Of reason in my inward powers; and speech END
BEGIN NOW Wanted not long; though to this shape retained. END
BEGIN NOW Thenceforth to speculations high or deep END
BEGIN NOW I turned my thoughts, and with capacious mind END
BEGIN NOW Considered all things visible in Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Or Earth, or Middle; all things fair and good: END
BEGIN NOW But all that fair and good in thy divine END
BEGIN NOW Semblance, and in thy beauty's heavenly ray, END
BEGIN NOW United I beheld; no fair to thine END
BEGIN NOW Equivalent or second! which compelled END
BEGIN NOW Me thus, though importune perhaps, to come END
BEGIN NOW And gaze, and worship thee of right declared END
BEGIN NOW Sovran of creatures, universal Dame! END
BEGIN NOW So talked the spirited sly Snake; and Eve, END
BEGIN NOW Yet more amazed, unwary thus replied. END
BEGIN NOW Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt END
BEGIN NOW The virtue of that fruit, in thee first proved: END
BEGIN NOW But say, where grows the tree? from hence how far? END
BEGIN NOW For many are the trees of God that grow END
BEGIN NOW In Paradise, and various, yet unknown END
BEGIN NOW To us; in such abundance lies our choice, END
BEGIN NOW As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched, END
BEGIN NOW Still hanging incorruptible, till men END
BEGIN NOW Grow up to their provision, and more hands END
BEGIN NOW Help to disburden Nature of her birth. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad. END
BEGIN NOW Empress, the way is ready, and not long; END
BEGIN NOW Beyond a row of myrtles, on a flat, END
BEGIN NOW Fast by a fountain, one small thicket past END
BEGIN NOW Of blowing myrrh and balm: if thou accept END
BEGIN NOW My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon END
BEGIN NOW Lead then, said Eve. He, leading, swiftly rolled END
BEGIN NOW In tangles, and made intricate seem straight, END
BEGIN NOW To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy END
BEGIN NOW Brightens his crest; as when a wandering fire, END
BEGIN NOW Compact of unctuous vapour, which the night END
BEGIN NOW Condenses, and the cold environs round, END
BEGIN NOW Kindled through agitation to a flame, END
BEGIN NOW Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends, END
BEGIN NOW Hovering and blazing with delusive light, END
BEGIN NOW Misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way END
BEGIN NOW To bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool; END
BEGIN NOW There swallowed up and lost, from succour far. END
BEGIN NOW So glistered the dire Snake, and into fraud END
BEGIN NOW Led Eve, our credulous mother, to the tree END
BEGIN NOW Of prohibition, root of all our woe; END
BEGIN NOW Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. END
BEGIN NOW Serpent, we might have spared our coming hither, END
BEGIN NOW Fruitless to me, though fruit be here to excess, END
BEGIN NOW The credit of whose virtue rest with thee; END
BEGIN NOW Wonderous indeed, if cause of such effects. END
BEGIN NOW But of this tree we may not taste nor touch; END
BEGIN NOW God so commanded, and left that command END
BEGIN NOW Sole daughter of his voice; the rest, we live END
BEGIN NOW Law to ourselves; our reason is our law. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Tempter guilefully replied. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed! hath God then said that of the fruit END
BEGIN NOW Of all these garden-trees ye shall not eat, END
BEGIN NOW Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air? END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Eve, yet sinless. Of the fruit END
BEGIN NOW Of each tree in the garden we may eat; END
BEGIN NOW But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst END
BEGIN NOW The garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat END
BEGIN NOW Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die. END
BEGIN NOW She scarce had said, though brief, when now more bold END
BEGIN NOW The Tempter, but with show of zeal and love END
BEGIN NOW To Man, and indignation at his wrong, END
BEGIN NOW New part puts on; and, as to passion moved, END
BEGIN NOW Fluctuates disturbed, yet comely and in act END
BEGIN NOW Raised, as of some great matter to begin. END
BEGIN NOW As when of old some orator renowned, END
BEGIN NOW In Athens or free Rome, where eloquence END
BEGIN NOW Flourished, since mute! to some great cause addressed, END
BEGIN NOW Stood in himself collected; while each part, END
BEGIN NOW Motion, each act, won audience ere the tongue; END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes in highth began, as no delay END
BEGIN NOW Of preface brooking, through his zeal of right: END
BEGIN NOW So standing, moving, or to highth up grown, END
BEGIN NOW The Tempter, all impassioned, thus began. END
BEGIN NOW O sacred, wise, and wisdom-giving Plant, END
BEGIN NOW Mother of science! now I feel thy power END
BEGIN NOW Within me clear; not only to discern END
BEGIN NOW Things in their causes, but to trace the ways END
BEGIN NOW Of highest agents, deemed however wise. END
BEGIN NOW Queen of this universe! do not believe END
BEGIN NOW Those rigid threats of death: ye shall not die: END
BEGIN NOW How should you? by the fruit? it gives you life END
BEGIN NOW To knowledge; by the threatener? look on me, END
BEGIN NOW Me, who have touched and tasted; yet both live, END
BEGIN NOW And life more perfect have attained than Fate END
BEGIN NOW Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot. END
BEGIN NOW Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast END
BEGIN NOW Is open? or will God incense his ire END
BEGIN NOW For such a petty trespass? and not praise END
BEGIN NOW Rather your dauntless virtue, whom the pain END
BEGIN NOW Of death denounced, whatever thing death be, END
BEGIN NOW Deterred not from achieving what might lead END
BEGIN NOW To happier life, knowledge of good and evil; END
BEGIN NOW Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil END
BEGIN NOW Be real, why not known, since easier shunned? END
BEGIN NOW God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; END
BEGIN NOW Not just, not God; not feared then, nor obeyed: END
BEGIN NOW Your fear itself of death removes the fear. END
BEGIN NOW Why then was this forbid? Why, but to awe; END
BEGIN NOW Why, but to keep ye low and ignorant, END
BEGIN NOW His worshippers? He knows that in the day END
BEGIN NOW Ye eat thereof, your eyes that seem so clear, END
BEGIN NOW Yet are but dim, shall perfectly be then END
BEGIN NOW Opened and cleared, and ye shall be as Gods, END
BEGIN NOW Knowing both good and evil, as they know. END
BEGIN NOW That ye shall be as Gods, since I as Man, END
BEGIN NOW Internal Man, is but proportion meet; END
BEGIN NOW I, of brute, human; ye, of human, Gods. END
BEGIN NOW So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off END
BEGIN NOW Human, to put on Gods; death to be wished, END
BEGIN NOW Though threatened, which no worse than this can bring. END
BEGIN NOW And what are Gods, that Man may not become END
BEGIN NOW As they, participating God-like food? END
BEGIN NOW The Gods are first, and that advantage use END
BEGIN NOW On our belief, that all from them proceeds: END
BEGIN NOW I question it; for this fair earth I see, END
BEGIN NOW Warmed by the sun, producing every kind; END
BEGIN NOW Them, nothing: if they all things, who enclosed END
BEGIN NOW Knowledge of good and evil in this tree, END
BEGIN NOW That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains END
BEGIN NOW Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies END
BEGIN NOW The offence, that Man should thus attain to know? END
BEGIN NOW What can your knowledge hurt him, or this tree END
BEGIN NOW Impart against his will, if all be his? END
BEGIN NOW Or is it envy? and can envy dwell END
BEGIN NOW In heavenly breasts? These, these, and many more END
BEGIN NOW Causes import your need of this fair fruit. END
BEGIN NOW Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste! END
BEGIN NOW He ended; and his words, replete with guile, END
BEGIN NOW Into her heart too easy entrance won: END
BEGIN NOW Fixed on the fruit she gazed, which to behold END
BEGIN NOW Might tempt alone; and in her ears the sound END
BEGIN NOW Yet rung of his persuasive words, impregned END
BEGIN NOW With reason, to her seeming, and with truth: END
BEGIN NOW Mean while the hour of noon drew on, and waked END
BEGIN NOW An eager appetite, raised by the smell END
BEGIN NOW So savoury of that fruit, which with desire, END
BEGIN NOW Inclinable now grown to touch or taste, END
BEGIN NOW Solicited her longing eye; yet first END
BEGIN NOW Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused. END
BEGIN NOW Great are thy virtues, doubtless, best of fruits, END
BEGIN NOW Though kept from man, and worthy to be admired; END
BEGIN NOW Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay END
BEGIN NOW Gave elocution to the mute, and taught END
BEGIN NOW The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise: END
BEGIN NOW Thy praise he also, who forbids thy use, END
BEGIN NOW Conceals not from us, naming thee the tree END
BEGIN NOW Of knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; END
BEGIN NOW Forbids us then to taste! but his forbidding END
BEGIN NOW Commends thee more, while it infers the good END
BEGIN NOW By thee communicated, and our want: END
BEGIN NOW For good unknown sure is not had; or, had END
BEGIN NOW And yet unknown, is as not had at all. END
BEGIN NOW In plain then, what forbids he but to know, END
BEGIN NOW Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? END
BEGIN NOW Such prohibitions bind not. But, if death END
BEGIN NOW Bind us with after-bands, what profits then END
BEGIN NOW Our inward freedom? In the day we eat END
BEGIN NOW Of this fair fruit, our doom is, we shall die! END
BEGIN NOW How dies the Serpent? he hath eaten and lives, END
BEGIN NOW And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns, END
BEGIN NOW Irrational till then. For us alone END
BEGIN NOW Was death invented? or to us denied END
BEGIN NOW This intellectual food, for beasts reserved? END
BEGIN NOW For beasts it seems: yet that one beast which first END
BEGIN NOW Hath tasted envies not, but brings with joy END
BEGIN NOW The good befallen him, author unsuspect, END
BEGIN NOW Friendly to man, far from deceit or guile. END
BEGIN NOW What fear I then? rather, what know to fear END
BEGIN NOW Under this ignorance of good and evil, END
BEGIN NOW Of God or death, of law or penalty? END
BEGIN NOW Here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine, END
BEGIN NOW Fair to the eye, inviting to the taste, END
BEGIN NOW Of virtue to make wise: What hinders then END
BEGIN NOW To reach, and feed at once both body and mind? END
BEGIN NOW So saying, her rash hand in evil hour END
BEGIN NOW Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat! END
BEGIN NOW Earth felt the wound; and Nature from her seat, END
BEGIN NOW Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe, END
BEGIN NOW That all was lost. Back to the thicket slunk END
BEGIN NOW The guilty Serpent; and well might; for Eve, END
BEGIN NOW Intent now wholly on her taste, nought else END
BEGIN NOW Regarded; such delight till then, as seemed, END
BEGIN NOW In fruit she never tasted, whether true END
BEGIN NOW Or fancied so, through expectation high END
BEGIN NOW Of knowledge; not was Godhead from her thought. END
BEGIN NOW Greedily she ingorged without restraint, END
BEGIN NOW And knew not eating death: Satiate at length, END
BEGIN NOW And hightened as with wine, jocund and boon, END
BEGIN NOW Thus to herself she pleasingly began. END
BEGIN NOW O sovran, virtuous, precious of all trees END
BEGIN NOW In Paradise! of operation blest END
BEGIN NOW To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed. END
BEGIN NOW And thy fair fruit let hang, as to no end END
BEGIN NOW Created; but henceforth my early care, END
BEGIN NOW Not without song, each morning, and due praise, END
BEGIN NOW Shall tend thee, and the fertile burden ease END
BEGIN NOW Of thy full branches offered free to all; END
BEGIN NOW Till, dieted by thee, I grow mature END
BEGIN NOW In knowledge, as the Gods, who all things know; END
BEGIN NOW Though others envy what they cannot give: END
BEGIN NOW For, had the gift been theirs, it had not here END
BEGIN NOW Thus grown. Experience, next, to thee I owe, END
BEGIN NOW Best guide; not following thee, I had remained END
BEGIN NOW In ignorance; thou openest wisdom's way, END
BEGIN NOW And givest access, though secret she retire. END
BEGIN NOW And I perhaps am secret: Heaven is high, END
BEGIN NOW High, and remote to see from thence distinct END
BEGIN NOW Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps END
BEGIN NOW May have diverted from continual watch END
BEGIN NOW Our great Forbidder, safe with all his spies END
BEGIN NOW About him. But to Adam in what sort END
BEGIN NOW Shall I appear? shall I to him make known END
BEGIN NOW As yet my change, and give him to partake END
BEGIN NOW Full happiness with me, or rather not, END
BEGIN NOW But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power END
BEGIN NOW Without copartner? so to add what wants END
BEGIN NOW In female sex, the more to draw his love, END
BEGIN NOW And render me more equal; and perhaps, END
BEGIN NOW A thing not undesirable, sometime END
BEGIN NOW Superiour; for, inferiour, who is free END
BEGIN NOW This may be well: But what if God have seen, END
BEGIN NOW And death ensue? then I shall be no more! END
BEGIN NOW And Adam, wedded to another Eve, END
BEGIN NOW Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; END
BEGIN NOW A death to think! Confirmed then I resolve, END
BEGIN NOW Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: END
BEGIN NOW So dear I love him, that with him all deaths END
BEGIN NOW I could endure, without him live no life. END
BEGIN NOW So saying, from the tree her step she turned; END
BEGIN NOW But first low reverence done, as to the Power END
BEGIN NOW That dwelt within, whose presence had infused END
BEGIN NOW Into the plant sciential sap, derived END
BEGIN NOW From nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while, END
BEGIN NOW Waiting desirous her return, had wove END
BEGIN NOW Of choicest flowers a garland, to adorn END
BEGIN NOW Her tresses, and her rural labours crown; END
BEGIN NOW As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen. END
BEGIN NOW Great joy he promised to his thoughts, and new END
BEGIN NOW Solace in her return, so long delayed: END
BEGIN NOW Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill, END
BEGIN NOW Misgave him; he the faltering measure felt; END
BEGIN NOW And forth to meet her went, the way she took END
BEGIN NOW That morn when first they parted: by the tree END
BEGIN NOW Of knowledge he must pass; there he her met, END
BEGIN NOW Scarce from the tree returning; in her hand END
BEGIN NOW A bough of fairest fruit, that downy smiled, END
BEGIN NOW New gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused. END
BEGIN NOW To him she hasted; in her face excuse END
BEGIN NOW Came prologue, and apology too prompt; END
BEGIN NOW Which, with bland words at will, she thus addressed. END
BEGIN NOW Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay? END
BEGIN NOW Thee I have missed, and thought it long, deprived END
BEGIN NOW Thy presence; agony of love till now END
BEGIN NOW Not felt, nor shall be twice; for never more END
BEGIN NOW Mean I to try, what rash untried I sought, END
BEGIN NOW The pain of absence from thy sight. But strange END
BEGIN NOW Hath been the cause, and wonderful to hear: END
BEGIN NOW This tree is not, as we are told, a tree END
BEGIN NOW Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown END
BEGIN NOW Opening the way, but of divine effect END
BEGIN NOW To open eyes, and make them Gods who taste; END
BEGIN NOW And hath been tasted such: The serpent wise, END
BEGIN NOW Or not restrained as we, or not obeying, END
BEGIN NOW Hath eaten of the fruit; and is become, END
BEGIN NOW Not dead, as we are threatened, but thenceforth END
BEGIN NOW Endued with human voice and human sense, END
BEGIN NOW Reasoning to admiration; and with me END
BEGIN NOW Persuasively hath so prevailed, that I END
BEGIN NOW Have also tasted, and have also found END
BEGIN NOW The effects to correspond; opener mine eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Dim erst, dilated spirits, ampler heart, END
BEGIN NOW And growing up to Godhead; which for thee END
BEGIN NOW Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. END
BEGIN NOW For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss; END
BEGIN NOW Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon. END
BEGIN NOW Thou therefore also taste, that equal lot END
BEGIN NOW May join us, equal joy, as equal love; END
BEGIN NOW Lest, thou not tasting, different degree END
BEGIN NOW Disjoin us, and I then too late renounce END
BEGIN NOW Deity for thee, when Fate will not permit. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told; END
BEGIN NOW But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed. END
BEGIN NOW On the other side Adam, soon as he heard END
BEGIN NOW The fatal trespass done by Eve, amazed, END
BEGIN NOW Astonied stood and blank, while horrour chill END
BEGIN NOW Ran through his veins, and all his joints relaxed; END
BEGIN NOW From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve END
BEGIN NOW Down dropt, and all the faded roses shed: END
BEGIN NOW Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length END
BEGIN NOW First to himself he inward silence broke. END
BEGIN NOW O fairest of Creation, last and best END
BEGIN NOW Of all God's works, Creature in whom excelled END
BEGIN NOW Whatever can to sight or thought be formed, END
BEGIN NOW Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! END
BEGIN NOW How art thou lost! how on a sudden lost, END
BEGIN NOW Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote! END
BEGIN NOW Rather, how hast thou yielded to transgress END
BEGIN NOW The strict forbiddance, how to violate END
BEGIN NOW The sacred fruit forbidden! Some cursed fraud END
BEGIN NOW Of enemy hath beguiled thee, yet unknown, END
BEGIN NOW And me with thee hath ruined; for with thee END
BEGIN NOW Certain my resolution is to die: END
BEGIN NOW How can I live without thee! how forego END
BEGIN NOW Thy sweet converse, and love so dearly joined, END
BEGIN NOW To live again in these wild woods forlorn! END
BEGIN NOW Should God create another Eve, and I END
BEGIN NOW Another rib afford, yet loss of thee END
BEGIN NOW Would never from my heart: no, no! I feel END
BEGIN NOW The link of Nature draw me: flesh of flesh, END
BEGIN NOW Bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state END
BEGIN NOW Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. END
BEGIN NOW So having said, as one from sad dismay END
BEGIN NOW Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbed END
BEGIN NOW Submitting to what seemed remediless, END
BEGIN NOW Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned. END
BEGIN NOW Bold deed thou hast presumed, adventurous Eve, END
BEGIN NOW And peril great provoked, who thus hast dared, END
BEGIN NOW Had it been only coveting to eye END
BEGIN NOW That sacred fruit, sacred to abstinence, END
BEGIN NOW Much more to taste it under ban to touch. END
BEGIN NOW But past who can recall, or done undo? END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps thou shalt not die, perhaps the fact END
BEGIN NOW Is not so heinous now, foretasted fruit, END
BEGIN NOW Profaned first by the serpent, by him first END
BEGIN NOW Made common, and unhallowed, ere our taste; END
BEGIN NOW Nor yet on him found deadly; yet he lives; END
BEGIN NOW Lives, as thou saidst, and gains to live, as Man, END
BEGIN NOW Higher degree of life; inducement strong END
BEGIN NOW To us, as likely tasting to attain END
BEGIN NOW Proportional ascent; which cannot be END
BEGIN NOW But to be Gods, or Angels, demi-Gods. END
BEGIN NOW Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, END
BEGIN NOW Though threatening, will in earnest so destroy END
BEGIN NOW Us his prime creatures, dignified so high, END
BEGIN NOW Set over all his works; which in our fall, END
BEGIN NOW For us created, needs with us must fail, END
BEGIN NOW Dependant made; so God shall uncreate, END
BEGIN NOW Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour lose; END
BEGIN NOW Not well conceived of God, who, though his power END
BEGIN NOW Creation could repeat, yet would be loth END
BEGIN NOW Us to abolish, lest the Adversary END
BEGIN NOW Triumph, and say; "Fickle their state whom God END
BEGIN NOW Most favours; who can please him long? Me first END
BEGIN NOW He ruined, now Mankind; whom will he next? END
BEGIN NOW Matter of scorn, not to be given the Foe. END
BEGIN NOW However I with thee have fixed my lot, END
BEGIN NOW Certain to undergo like doom: If death END
BEGIN NOW Consort with thee, death is to me as life; END
BEGIN NOW So forcible within my heart I feel END
BEGIN NOW The bond of Nature draw me to my own; END
BEGIN NOW My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; END
BEGIN NOW Our state cannot be severed; we are one, END
BEGIN NOW One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself. END
BEGIN NOW So Adam; and thus Eve to him replied. END
BEGIN NOW O glorious trial of exceeding love, END
BEGIN NOW Illustrious evidence, example high! END
BEGIN NOW Engaging me to emulate; but, short END
BEGIN NOW Of thy perfection, how shall I attain, END
BEGIN NOW Adam, from whose dear side I boast me sprung, END
BEGIN NOW And gladly of our union hear thee speak, END
BEGIN NOW One heart, one soul in both; whereof good proof END
BEGIN NOW This day affords, declaring thee resolved, END
BEGIN NOW Rather than death, or aught than death more dread, END
BEGIN NOW Shall separate us, linked in love so dear, END
BEGIN NOW To undergo with me one guilt, one crime, END
BEGIN NOW If any be, of tasting this fair fruit; END
BEGIN NOW Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds, END
BEGIN NOW Direct, or by occasion, hath presented END
BEGIN NOW This happy trial of thy love, which else END
BEGIN NOW So eminently never had been known? END
BEGIN NOW Were it I thought death menaced would ensue END
BEGIN NOW This my attempt, I would sustain alone END
BEGIN NOW The worst, and not persuade thee, rather die END
BEGIN NOW Deserted, than oblige thee with a fact END
BEGIN NOW Pernicious to thy peace; chiefly assured END
BEGIN NOW Remarkably so late of thy so true, END
BEGIN NOW So faithful, love unequalled: but I feel END
BEGIN NOW Far otherwise the event; not death, but life END
BEGIN NOW Augmented, opened eyes, new hopes, new joys, END
BEGIN NOW Taste so divine, that what of sweet before END
BEGIN NOW Hath touched my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. END
BEGIN NOW On my experience, Adam, freely taste, END
BEGIN NOW And fear of death deliver to the winds. END
BEGIN NOW So saying, she embraced him, and for joy END
BEGIN NOW Tenderly wept; much won, that he his love END
BEGIN NOW Had so ennobled, as of choice to incur END
BEGIN NOW Divine displeasure for her sake, or death. END
BEGIN NOW In recompence (for such compliance bad END
BEGIN NOW Such recompence best merits) from the bough END
BEGIN NOW She gave him of that fair enticing fruit END
BEGIN NOW With liberal hand: he scrupled not to eat, END
BEGIN NOW Against his better knowledge; not deceived, END
BEGIN NOW But fondly overcome with female charm. END
BEGIN NOW Earth trembled from her entrails, as again END
BEGIN NOW In pangs; and Nature gave a second groan; END
BEGIN NOW Sky loured; and, muttering thunder, some sad drops END
BEGIN NOW Wept at completing of the mortal sin END
BEGIN NOW Original: while Adam took no thought, END
BEGIN NOW Eating his fill; nor Eve to iterate END
BEGIN NOW Her former trespass feared, the more to sooth END
BEGIN NOW Him with her loved society; that now, END
BEGIN NOW As with new wine intoxicated both, END
BEGIN NOW They swim in mirth, and fancy that they feel END
BEGIN NOW Divinity within them breeding wings, END
BEGIN NOW Wherewith to scorn the earth: But that false fruit END
BEGIN NOW Far other operation first displayed, END
BEGIN NOW Carnal desire inflaming; he on Eve END
BEGIN NOW Began to cast lascivious eyes; she him END
BEGIN NOW As wantonly repaid; in lust they burn: END
BEGIN NOW Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move. END
BEGIN NOW Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste, END
BEGIN NOW And elegant, of sapience no small part; END
BEGIN NOW Since to each meaning savour we apply, END
BEGIN NOW And palate call judicious; I the praise END
BEGIN NOW Yield thee, so well this day thou hast purveyed. END
BEGIN NOW Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstained END
BEGIN NOW From this delightful fruit, nor known till now END
BEGIN NOW True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be END
BEGIN NOW In things to us forbidden, it might be wished, END
BEGIN NOW For this one tree had been forbidden ten. END
BEGIN NOW But come, so well refreshed, now let us play, END
BEGIN NOW As meet is, after such delicious fare; END
BEGIN NOW For never did thy beauty, since the day END
BEGIN NOW I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorned END
BEGIN NOW With all perfections, so inflame my sense END
BEGIN NOW With ardour to enjoy thee, fairer now END
BEGIN NOW Than ever; bounty of this virtuous tree! END
BEGIN NOW So said he, and forbore not glance or toy END
BEGIN NOW Of amorous intent; well understood END
BEGIN NOW Of Eve, whose eye darted contagious fire. END
BEGIN NOW Her hand he seised; and to a shady bank, END
BEGIN NOW Thick over-head with verdant roof imbowered, END
BEGIN NOW He led her nothing loth; flowers were the couch, END
BEGIN NOW Pansies, and violets, and asphodel, END
BEGIN NOW And hyacinth; Earth's freshest softest lap. END
BEGIN NOW There they their fill of love and love's disport END
BEGIN NOW Took largely, of their mutual guilt the seal, END
BEGIN NOW The solace of their sin; till dewy sleep END
BEGIN NOW Oppressed them, wearied with their amorous play, END
BEGIN NOW Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit, END
BEGIN NOW That with exhilarating vapour bland END
BEGIN NOW About their spirits had played, and inmost powers END
BEGIN NOW Made err, was now exhaled; and grosser sleep, END
BEGIN NOW Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams END
BEGIN NOW Incumbered, now had left them; up they rose END
BEGIN NOW As from unrest; and, each the other viewing, END
BEGIN NOW Soon found their eyes how opened, and their minds END
BEGIN NOW How darkened; innocence, that as a veil END
BEGIN NOW Had shadowed them from knowing ill, was gone; END
BEGIN NOW Just confidence, and native righteousness, END
BEGIN NOW And honour, from about them, naked left END
BEGIN NOW To guilty Shame; he covered, but his robe END
BEGIN NOW Uncovered more. So rose the Danite strong, END
BEGIN NOW Herculean Samson, from the harlot-lap END
BEGIN NOW Of Philistean Dalilah, and waked END
BEGIN NOW Shorn of his strength. They destitute and bare END
BEGIN NOW Of all their virtue: Silent, and in face END
BEGIN NOW Confounded, long they sat, as strucken mute: END
BEGIN NOW Till Adam, though not less than Eve abashed, END
BEGIN NOW At length gave utterance to these words constrained. END
BEGIN NOW O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear END
BEGIN NOW To that false worm, of whomsoever taught END
BEGIN NOW To counterfeit Man's voice; true in our fall, END
BEGIN NOW False in our promised rising; since our eyes END
BEGIN NOW Opened we find indeed, and find we know END
BEGIN NOW Both good and evil; good lost, and evil got; END
BEGIN NOW Bad fruit of knowledge, if this be to know; END
BEGIN NOW Which leaves us naked thus, of honour void, END
BEGIN NOW Of innocence, of faith, of purity, END
BEGIN NOW Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained, END
BEGIN NOW And in our faces evident the signs END
BEGIN NOW Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store; END
BEGIN NOW Even shame, the last of evils; of the first END
BEGIN NOW Be sure then.--How shall I behold the face END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth of God or Angel, erst with joy END
BEGIN NOW And rapture so oft beheld? Those heavenly shapes END
BEGIN NOW Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze END
BEGIN NOW Insufferably bright. O! might I here END
BEGIN NOW In solitude live savage; in some glade END
BEGIN NOW Obscured, where highest woods, impenetrable END
BEGIN NOW To star or sun-light, spread their umbrage broad END
BEGIN NOW And brown as evening: Cover me, ye Pines! END
BEGIN NOW Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs END
BEGIN NOW Hide me, where I may never see them more!-- END
BEGIN NOW But let us now, as in bad plight, devise END
BEGIN NOW What best may for the present serve to hide END
BEGIN NOW The parts of each from other, that seem most END
BEGIN NOW To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen; END
BEGIN NOW Some tree, whose broad smooth leaves together sewed, END
BEGIN NOW And girded on our loins, may cover round END
BEGIN NOW Those middle parts; that this new comer, Shame, END
BEGIN NOW There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. END
BEGIN NOW So counselled he, and both together went END
BEGIN NOW Into the thickest wood; there soon they chose END
BEGIN NOW The fig-tree; not that kind for fruit renowned, END
BEGIN NOW But such as at this day, to Indians known, END
BEGIN NOW In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms END
BEGIN NOW Branching so broad and long, that in the ground END
BEGIN NOW The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow END
BEGIN NOW About the mother tree, a pillared shade END
BEGIN NOW High over-arched, and echoing walks between: END
BEGIN NOW There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat, END
BEGIN NOW Shelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds END
BEGIN NOW At loop-holes cut through thickest shade: Those leaves END
BEGIN NOW They gathered, broad as Amazonian targe; END
BEGIN NOW And, with what skill they had, together sewed, END
BEGIN NOW To gird their waist; vain covering, if to hide END
BEGIN NOW Their guilt and dreaded shame! O, how unlike END
BEGIN NOW To that first naked glory! Such of late END
BEGIN NOW Columbus found the American, so girt END
BEGIN NOW With feathered cincture; naked else, and wild END
BEGIN NOW Among the trees on isles and woody shores. END
BEGIN NOW Thus fenced, and, as they thought, their shame in part END
BEGIN NOW Covered, but not at rest or ease of mind, END
BEGIN NOW They sat them down to weep; nor only tears END
BEGIN NOW Rained at their eyes, but high winds worse within END
BEGIN NOW Began to rise, high passions, anger, hate, END
BEGIN NOW Mistrust, suspicion, discord; and shook sore END
BEGIN NOW Their inward state of mind, calm region once END
BEGIN NOW And full of peace, now tost and turbulent: END
BEGIN NOW For Understanding ruled not, and the Will END
BEGIN NOW Heard not her lore; both in subjection now END
BEGIN NOW To sensual Appetite, who from beneath END
BEGIN NOW Usurping over sovran Reason claimed END
BEGIN NOW Superiour sway: From thus distempered breast, END
BEGIN NOW Adam, estranged in look and altered style, END
BEGIN NOW Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed. END
BEGIN NOW Would thou hadst hearkened to my words, and staid END
BEGIN NOW With me, as I besought thee, when that strange END
BEGIN NOW Desire of wandering, this unhappy morn, END
BEGIN NOW I know not whence possessed thee; we had then END
BEGIN NOW Remained still happy; not, as now, despoiled END
BEGIN NOW Of all our good; shamed, naked, miserable! END
BEGIN NOW Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve END
BEGIN NOW The faith they owe; when earnestly they seek END
BEGIN NOW Such proof, conclude, they then begin to fail. END
BEGIN NOW To whom, soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve. END
BEGIN NOW What words have passed thy lips, Adam severe! END
BEGIN NOW Imputest thou that to my default, or will END
BEGIN NOW Of wandering, as thou callest it, which who knows END
BEGIN NOW But might as ill have happened thou being by, END
BEGIN NOW Or to thyself perhaps? Hadst thou been there, END
BEGIN NOW Or here the attempt, thou couldst not have discerned END
BEGIN NOW Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; END
BEGIN NOW No ground of enmity between us known, END
BEGIN NOW Why he should mean me ill, or seek to harm. END
BEGIN NOW Was I to have never parted from thy side? END
BEGIN NOW As good have grown there still a lifeless rib. END
BEGIN NOW Being as I am, why didst not thou, the head, END
BEGIN NOW Command me absolutely not to go, END
BEGIN NOW Going into such danger, as thou saidst? END
BEGIN NOW Too facile then, thou didst not much gainsay; END
BEGIN NOW Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. END
BEGIN NOW Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent, END
BEGIN NOW Neither had I transgressed, nor thou with me. END
BEGIN NOW To whom, then first incensed, Adam replied. END
BEGIN NOW Is this the love, is this the recompence END
BEGIN NOW Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve! expressed END
BEGIN NOW Immutable, when thou wert lost, not I; END
BEGIN NOW Who might have lived, and joyed immortal bliss, END
BEGIN NOW Yet willingly chose rather death with thee? END
BEGIN NOW And am I now upbraided as the cause END
BEGIN NOW Of thy transgressing? Not enough severe, END
BEGIN NOW It seems, in thy restraint: What could I more END
BEGIN NOW I warned thee, I admonished thee, foretold END
BEGIN NOW The danger, and the lurking enemy END
BEGIN NOW That lay in wait; beyond this, had been force; END
BEGIN NOW And force upon free will hath here no place. END
BEGIN NOW But confidence then bore thee on; secure END
BEGIN NOW Either to meet no danger, or to find END
BEGIN NOW Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps END
BEGIN NOW I also erred, in overmuch admiring END
BEGIN NOW What seemed in thee so perfect, that I thought END
BEGIN NOW No evil durst attempt thee; but I rue END
BEGIN NOW The errour now, which is become my crime, END
BEGIN NOW And thou the accuser. Thus it shall befall END
BEGIN NOW Him, who, to worth in women overtrusting, END
BEGIN NOW Lets her will rule: restraint she will not brook; END
BEGIN NOW And, left to herself, if evil thence ensue, END
BEGIN NOW She first his weak indulgence will accuse. END
BEGIN NOW Thus they in mutual accusation spent END
BEGIN NOW The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning; END
BEGIN NOW And of their vain contest appeared no end. END
BEGIN NOW Mean while the heinous and despiteful act END
BEGIN NOW Of Satan, done in Paradise; and how END
BEGIN NOW He, in the serpent, had perverted Eve, END
BEGIN NOW Her husband she, to taste the fatal fruit, END
BEGIN NOW Was known in Heaven; for what can 'scape the eye END
BEGIN NOW Of God all-seeing, or deceive his heart END
BEGIN NOW Omniscient? who, in all things wise and just, END
BEGIN NOW Hindered not Satan to attempt the mind END
BEGIN NOW Of Man, with strength entire and free will armed, END
BEGIN NOW Complete to have discovered and repulsed END
BEGIN NOW Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend. END
BEGIN NOW For still they knew, and ought to have still remembered, END
BEGIN NOW The high injunction, not to taste that fruit, END
BEGIN NOW Whoever tempted; which they not obeying, END
BEGIN NOW (Incurred what could they less?) the penalty; END
BEGIN NOW And, manifold in sin, deserved to fall. END
BEGIN NOW Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste END
BEGIN NOW The angelick guards ascended, mute, and sad, END
BEGIN NOW For Man; for of his state by this they knew, END
BEGIN NOW Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen END
BEGIN NOW Entrance unseen. Soon as the unwelcome news END
BEGIN NOW From Earth arrived at Heaven-gate, displeased END
BEGIN NOW All were who heard; dim sadness did not spare END
BEGIN NOW That time celestial visages, yet, mixed END
BEGIN NOW With pity, violated not their bliss. END
BEGIN NOW About the new-arrived, in multitudes END
BEGIN NOW The ethereal people ran, to hear and know END
BEGIN NOW How all befel: They towards the throne supreme, END
BEGIN NOW Accountable, made haste, to make appear, END
BEGIN NOW With righteous plea, their utmost vigilance END
BEGIN NOW And easily approved; when the Most High END
BEGIN NOW Eternal Father, from his secret cloud, END
BEGIN NOW Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice. END
BEGIN NOW Assembled Angels, and ye Powers returned END
BEGIN NOW From unsuccessful charge; be not dismayed, END
BEGIN NOW Nor troubled at these tidings from the earth, END
BEGIN NOW Which your sincerest care could not prevent; END
BEGIN NOW Foretold so lately what would come to pass, END
BEGIN NOW When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell. END
BEGIN NOW I told ye then he should prevail, and speed END
BEGIN NOW On his bad errand; Man should be seduced, END
BEGIN NOW And flattered out of all, believing lies END
BEGIN NOW Against his Maker; no decree of mine END
BEGIN NOW Concurring to necessitate his fall, END
BEGIN NOW Or touch with lightest moment of impulse END
BEGIN NOW His free will, to her own inclining left END
BEGIN NOW In even scale. But fallen he is; and now END
BEGIN NOW What rests, but that the mortal sentence pass END
BEGIN NOW On his transgression,--death denounced that day? END
BEGIN NOW Which he presumes already vain and void, END
BEGIN NOW Because not yet inflicted, as he feared, END
BEGIN NOW By some immediate stroke; but soon shall find END
BEGIN NOW Forbearance no acquittance, ere day end. END
BEGIN NOW Justice shall not return as bounty scorned. END
BEGIN NOW But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee, END
BEGIN NOW Vicegerent Son? To thee I have transferred END
BEGIN NOW All judgement, whether in Heaven, or Earth, or Hell. END
BEGIN NOW Easy it may be seen that I intend END
BEGIN NOW Mercy colleague with justice, sending thee END
BEGIN NOW Man's friend, his Mediator, his designed END
BEGIN NOW Both ransom and Redeemer voluntary, END
BEGIN NOW And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Father; and, unfolding bright END
BEGIN NOW Toward the right hand his glory, on the Son END
BEGIN NOW Blazed forth unclouded Deity: He full END
BEGIN NOW Resplendent all his Father manifest END
BEGIN NOW Expressed, and thus divinely answered mild. END
BEGIN NOW Father Eternal, thine is to decree; END
BEGIN NOW Mine, both in Heaven and Earth, to do thy will END
BEGIN NOW Supreme; that thou in me, thy Son beloved, END
BEGIN NOW Mayest ever rest well pleased. I go to judge END
BEGIN NOW On earth these thy transgressours; but thou knowest, END
BEGIN NOW Whoever judged, the worst on me must light, END
BEGIN NOW When time shall be; for so I undertook END
BEGIN NOW Before thee; and, not repenting, this obtain END
BEGIN NOW Of right, that I may mitigate their doom END
BEGIN NOW On me derived; yet I shall temper so END
BEGIN NOW Justice with mercy, as may illustrate most END
BEGIN NOW Them fully satisfied, and thee appease. END
BEGIN NOW Attendance none shall need, nor train, where none END
BEGIN NOW Are to behold the judgement, but the judged, END
BEGIN NOW Those two; the third best absent is condemned, END
BEGIN NOW Convict by flight, and rebel to all law: END
BEGIN NOW Conviction to the serpent none belongs. END
BEGIN NOW Thus saying, from his radiant seat he rose END
BEGIN NOW Of high collateral glory: Him Thrones, and Powers, END
BEGIN NOW Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant, END
BEGIN NOW Accompanied to Heaven-gate; from whence END
BEGIN NOW Eden, and all the coast, in prospect lay. END
BEGIN NOW Down he descended straight; the speed of Gods END
BEGIN NOW Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes winged. END
BEGIN NOW Now was the sun in western cadence low END
BEGIN NOW From noon, and gentle airs, due at their hour, END
BEGIN NOW To fan the earth now waked, and usher in END
BEGIN NOW The evening cool; when he, from wrath more cool, END
BEGIN NOW Came the mild Judge, and Intercessour both, END
BEGIN NOW To sentence Man: The voice of God they heard END
BEGIN NOW Now walking in the garden, by soft winds END
BEGIN NOW Brought to their ears, while day declined; they heard, END
BEGIN NOW And from his presence hid themselves among END
BEGIN NOW The thickest trees, both man and wife; till God, END
BEGIN NOW Approaching, thus to Adam called aloud. END
BEGIN NOW Where art thou, Adam, wont with joy to meet END
BEGIN NOW My coming seen far off? I miss thee here, END
BEGIN NOW Not pleased, thus entertained with solitude, END
BEGIN NOW Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought: END
BEGIN NOW Or come I less conspicuous, or what change END
BEGIN NOW Absents thee, or what chance detains?--Come forth! END
BEGIN NOW He came; and with him Eve, more loth, though first END
BEGIN NOW To offend; discountenanced both, and discomposed; END
BEGIN NOW Love was not in their looks, either to God, END
BEGIN NOW Or to each other; but apparent guilt, END
BEGIN NOW And shame, and perturbation, and despair, END
BEGIN NOW Anger, and obstinacy, and hate, and guile. END
BEGIN NOW Whence Adam, faltering long, thus answered brief. END
BEGIN NOW I heard thee in the garden, and of thy voice END
BEGIN NOW Afraid, being naked, hid myself. To whom END
BEGIN NOW The gracious Judge without revile replied. END
BEGIN NOW My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not feared, END
BEGIN NOW But still rejoiced; how is it now become END
BEGIN NOW So dreadful to thee? That thou art naked, who END
BEGIN NOW Hath told thee? Hast thou eaten of the tree, END
BEGIN NOW Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat? END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Adam sore beset replied. END
BEGIN NOW O Heaven! in evil strait this day I stand END
BEGIN NOW Before my Judge; either to undergo END
BEGIN NOW Myself the total crime, or to accuse END
BEGIN NOW My other self, the partner of my life; END
BEGIN NOW Whose failing, while her faith to me remains, END
BEGIN NOW I should conceal, and not expose to blame END
BEGIN NOW By my complaint: but strict necessity END
BEGIN NOW Subdues me, and calamitous constraint; END
BEGIN NOW Lest on my head both sin and punishment, END
BEGIN NOW However insupportable, be all END
BEGIN NOW Devolved; though should I hold my peace, yet thou END
BEGIN NOW Wouldst easily detect what I conceal.-- END
BEGIN NOW This Woman, whom thou madest to be my help, END
BEGIN NOW And gavest me as thy perfect gift, so good, END
BEGIN NOW So fit, so acceptable, so divine, END
BEGIN NOW That from her hand I could suspect no ill, END
BEGIN NOW And what she did, whatever in itself, END
BEGIN NOW Her doing seemed to justify the deed; END
BEGIN NOW She gave me of the tree, and I did eat. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied. END
BEGIN NOW Was she thy God, that her thou didst obey END
BEGIN NOW Before his voice? or was she made thy guide, END
BEGIN NOW Superiour, or but equal, that to her END
BEGIN NOW Thou didst resign thy manhood, and the place END
BEGIN NOW Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, END
BEGIN NOW And for thee, whose perfection far excelled END
BEGIN NOW Hers in all real dignity? Adorned END
BEGIN NOW She was indeed, and lovely, to attract END
BEGIN NOW Thy love, not thy subjection; and her gifts END
BEGIN NOW Were such, as under government well seemed; END
BEGIN NOW Unseemly to bear rule; which was thy part END
BEGIN NOW And person, hadst thou known thyself aright. END
BEGIN NOW So having said, he thus to Eve in few. END
BEGIN NOW Say, Woman, what is this which thou hast done? END
BEGIN NOW To whom sad Eve, with shame nigh overwhelmed, END
BEGIN NOW Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge END
BEGIN NOW Bold or loquacious, thus abashed replied. END
BEGIN NOW The Serpent me beguiled, and I did eat. END
BEGIN NOW Which when the Lord God heard, without delay END
BEGIN NOW To judgement he proceeded on the accused END
BEGIN NOW Serpent, though brute; unable to transfer END
BEGIN NOW The guilt on him, who made him instrument END
BEGIN NOW Of mischief, and polluted from the end END
BEGIN NOW Of his creation; justly then accursed, END
BEGIN NOW As vitiated in nature: More to know END
BEGIN NOW Concerned not Man, (since he no further knew) END
BEGIN NOW Nor altered his offence; yet God at last END
BEGIN NOW To Satan first in sin his doom applied, END
BEGIN NOW Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best: END
BEGIN NOW And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. END
BEGIN NOW Because thou hast done this, thou art accursed END
BEGIN NOW Above all cattle, each beast of the field; END
BEGIN NOW Upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go, END
BEGIN NOW And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life. END
BEGIN NOW Between thee and the woman I will put END
BEGIN NOW Enmity, and between thine and her seed; END
BEGIN NOW Her seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel. END
BEGIN NOW So spake this oracle, then verified END
BEGIN NOW When Jesus, Son of Mary, second Eve, END
BEGIN NOW Saw Satan fall, like lightning, down from Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Prince of the air; then, rising from his grave END
BEGIN NOW Spoiled Principalities and Powers, triumphed END
BEGIN NOW In open show; and, with ascension bright, END
BEGIN NOW Captivity led captive through the air, END
BEGIN NOW The realm itself of Satan, long usurped; END
BEGIN NOW Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; END
BEGIN NOW Even he, who now foretold his fatal bruise; END
BEGIN NOW And to the Woman thus his sentence turned. END
BEGIN NOW Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply END
BEGIN NOW By thy conception; children thou shalt bring END
BEGIN NOW In sorrow forth; and to thy husband's will END
BEGIN NOW Thine shall submit; he over thee shall rule. END
BEGIN NOW On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced. END
BEGIN NOW Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, END
BEGIN NOW And eaten of the tree, concerning which END
BEGIN NOW I charged thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat thereof: END
BEGIN NOW Cursed is the ground for thy sake; thou in sorrow END
BEGIN NOW Shalt eat thereof, all the days of thy life; END
BEGIN NOW Thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth END
BEGIN NOW Unbid; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; END
BEGIN NOW In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, END
BEGIN NOW Till thou return unto the ground; for thou END
BEGIN NOW Out of the ground wast taken, know thy birth, END
BEGIN NOW For dust thou art, and shalt to dust return. END
BEGIN NOW So judged he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent; END
BEGIN NOW And the instant stroke of death, denounced that day, END
BEGIN NOW Removed far off; then, pitying how they stood END
BEGIN NOW Before him naked to the air, that now END
BEGIN NOW Must suffer change, disdained not to begin END
BEGIN NOW Thenceforth the form of servant to assume; END
BEGIN NOW As when he washed his servants feet; so now, END
BEGIN NOW As father of his family, he clad END
BEGIN NOW Their nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain, END
BEGIN NOW Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid; END
BEGIN NOW And thought not much to clothe his enemies; END
BEGIN NOW Nor he their outward only with the skins END
BEGIN NOW Of beasts, but inward nakedness, much more. END
BEGIN NOW Opprobrious, with his robe of righteousness, END
BEGIN NOW Arraying, covered from his Father's sight. END
BEGIN NOW To him with swift ascent he up returned, END
BEGIN NOW Into his blissful bosom reassumed END
BEGIN NOW In glory, as of old; to him appeased END
BEGIN NOW All, though all-knowing, what had passed with Man END
BEGIN NOW Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. END
BEGIN NOW Mean while, ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth, END
BEGIN NOW Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death, END
BEGIN NOW In counterview within the gates, that now END
BEGIN NOW Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame END
BEGIN NOW Far into Chaos, since the Fiend passed through, END
BEGIN NOW Sin opening; who thus now to Death began. END
BEGIN NOW O Son, why sit we here each other viewing END
BEGIN NOW Idly, while Satan, our great author, thrives END
BEGIN NOW In other worlds, and happier seat provides END
BEGIN NOW For us, his offspring dear? It cannot be END
BEGIN NOW But that success attends him; if mishap, END
BEGIN NOW Ere this he had returned, with fury driven END
BEGIN NOW By his avengers; since no place like this END
BEGIN NOW Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. END
BEGIN NOW Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, END
BEGIN NOW Wings growing, and dominion given me large END
BEGIN NOW Beyond this deep; whatever draws me on, END
BEGIN NOW Or sympathy, or some connatural force, END
BEGIN NOW Powerful at greatest distance to unite, END
BEGIN NOW With secret amity, things of like kind, END
BEGIN NOW By secretest conveyance. Thou, my shade END
BEGIN NOW Inseparable, must with me along; END
BEGIN NOW For Death from Sin no power can separate. END
BEGIN NOW But, lest the difficulty of passing back END
BEGIN NOW Stay his return perhaps over this gulf END
BEGIN NOW Impassable, impervious; let us try END
BEGIN NOW Adventurous work, yet to thy power and mine END
BEGIN NOW Not unagreeable, to found a path END
BEGIN NOW Over this main from Hell to that new world, END
BEGIN NOW Where Satan now prevails; a monument END
BEGIN NOW Of merit high to all the infernal host, END
BEGIN NOW Easing their passage hence, for intercourse, END
BEGIN NOW Or transmigration, as their lot shall lead. END
BEGIN NOW Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn END
BEGIN NOW By this new-felt attraction and instinct. END
BEGIN NOW Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon. END
BEGIN NOW Go, whither Fate, and inclination strong, END
BEGIN NOW Leads thee; I shall not lag behind, nor err END
BEGIN NOW The way, thou leading; such a scent I draw END
BEGIN NOW Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste END
BEGIN NOW The savour of death from all things there that live: END
BEGIN NOW Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest END
BEGIN NOW Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. END
BEGIN NOW So saying, with delight he snuffed the smell END
BEGIN NOW Of mortal change on earth. As when a flock END
BEGIN NOW Of ravenous fowl, though many a league remote, END
BEGIN NOW Against the day of battle, to a field, END
BEGIN NOW Where armies lie encamped, come flying, lured END
BEGIN NOW With scent of living carcasses designed END
BEGIN NOW For death, the following day, in bloody fight: END
BEGIN NOW So scented the grim Feature, and upturned END
BEGIN NOW His nostril wide into the murky air; END
BEGIN NOW Sagacious of his quarry from so far. END
BEGIN NOW Then both from out Hell-gates, into the waste END
BEGIN NOW Wide anarchy of Chaos, damp and dark, END
BEGIN NOW Flew diverse; and with power (their power was great) END
BEGIN NOW Hovering upon the waters, what they met END
BEGIN NOW Solid or slimy, as in raging sea END
BEGIN NOW Tost up and down, together crouded drove, END
BEGIN NOW From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell; END
BEGIN NOW As when two polar winds, blowing adverse END
BEGIN NOW Upon the Cronian sea, together drive END
BEGIN NOW Mountains of ice, that stop the imagined way END
BEGIN NOW Beyond Petsora eastward, to the rich END
BEGIN NOW Cathaian coast. The aggregated soil END
BEGIN NOW Death with his mace petrifick, cold and dry, END
BEGIN NOW As with a trident, smote; and fixed as firm END
BEGIN NOW As Delos, floating once; the rest his look END
BEGIN NOW Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move; END
BEGIN NOW And with Asphaltick slime, broad as the gate, END
BEGIN NOW Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach END
BEGIN NOW They fastened, and the mole immense wrought on END
BEGIN NOW Over the foaming deep high-arched, a bridge END
BEGIN NOW Of length prodigious, joining to the wall END
BEGIN NOW Immoveable of this now fenceless world, END
BEGIN NOW Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, END
BEGIN NOW Smooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell. END
BEGIN NOW So, if great things to small may be compared, END
BEGIN NOW Xerxes, the liberty of Greece to yoke, END
BEGIN NOW From Susa, his Memnonian palace high, END
BEGIN NOW Came to the sea: and, over Hellespont END
BEGIN NOW Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joined, END
BEGIN NOW And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves. END
BEGIN NOW Now had they brought the work by wonderous art END
BEGIN NOW Pontifical, a ridge of pendant rock, END
BEGIN NOW Over the vexed abyss, following the track END
BEGIN NOW Of Satan to the self-same place where he END
BEGIN NOW First lighted from his wing, and landed safe END
BEGIN NOW From out of Chaos, to the outside bare END
BEGIN NOW Of this round world: With pins of adamant END
BEGIN NOW And chains they made all fast, too fast they made END
BEGIN NOW And durable! And now in little space END
BEGIN NOW The confines met of empyrean Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW And of this World; and, on the left hand, Hell END
BEGIN NOW With long reach interposed; three several ways END
BEGIN NOW In sight, to each of these three places led. END
BEGIN NOW And now their way to Earth they had descried, END
BEGIN NOW To Paradise first tending; when, behold! END
BEGIN NOW Satan, in likeness of an Angel bright, END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering END
BEGIN NOW His zenith, while the sun in Aries rose: END
BEGIN NOW Disguised he came; but those his children dear END
BEGIN NOW Their parent soon discerned, though in disguise. END
BEGIN NOW He, after Eve seduced, unminded slunk END
BEGIN NOW Into the wood fast by; and, changing shape, END
BEGIN NOW To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act END
BEGIN NOW By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded END
BEGIN NOW Upon her husband; saw their shame that sought END
BEGIN NOW Vain covertures; but when he saw descend END
BEGIN NOW The Son of God to judge them, terrified END
BEGIN NOW He fled; not hoping to escape, but shun END
BEGIN NOW The present; fearing, guilty, what his wrath END
BEGIN NOW Might suddenly inflict; that past, returned END
BEGIN NOW By night, and listening where the hapless pair END
BEGIN NOW Sat in their sad discourse, and various plaint, END
BEGIN NOW Thence gathered his own doom; which understood END
BEGIN NOW Not instant, but of future time, with joy END
BEGIN NOW And tidings fraught, to Hell he now returned; END
BEGIN NOW And at the brink of Chaos, near the foot END
BEGIN NOW Of this new wonderous pontifice, unhoped END
BEGIN NOW Met, who to meet him came, his offspring dear. END
BEGIN NOW Great joy was at their meeting, and at sight END
BEGIN NOW Of that stupendous bridge his joy encreased. END
BEGIN NOW Long he admiring stood, till Sin, his fair END
BEGIN NOW Enchanting daughter, thus the silence broke. END
BEGIN NOW O Parent, these are thy magnifick deeds, END
BEGIN NOW Thy trophies! which thou viewest as not thine own; END
BEGIN NOW Thou art their author, and prime architect: END
BEGIN NOW For I no sooner in my heart divined, END
BEGIN NOW My heart, which by a secret harmony END
BEGIN NOW Still moves with thine, joined in connexion sweet, END
BEGIN NOW That thou on earth hadst prospered, which thy looks END
BEGIN NOW Now also evidence, but straight I felt, END
BEGIN NOW Though distant from thee worlds between, yet felt, END
BEGIN NOW That I must after thee, with this thy son; END
BEGIN NOW Such fatal consequence unites us three! END
BEGIN NOW Hell could no longer hold us in our bounds, END
BEGIN NOW Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure END
BEGIN NOW Detain from following thy illustrious track. END
BEGIN NOW Thou hast achieved our liberty, confined END
BEGIN NOW Within Hell-gates till now; thou us impowered END
BEGIN NOW To fortify thus far, and overlay, END
BEGIN NOW With this portentous bridge, the dark abyss. END
BEGIN NOW Thine now is all this world; thy virtue hath won END
BEGIN NOW What thy hands builded not; thy wisdom gained END
BEGIN NOW With odds what war hath lost, and fully avenged END
BEGIN NOW Our foil in Heaven; here thou shalt monarch reign, END
BEGIN NOW There didst not; there let him still victor sway, END
BEGIN NOW As battle hath adjudged; from this new world END
BEGIN NOW Retiring, by his own doom alienated; END
BEGIN NOW And henceforth monarchy with thee divide END
BEGIN NOW Of all things, parted by the empyreal bounds, END
BEGIN NOW His quadrature, from thy orbicular world; END
BEGIN NOW Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne. END
BEGIN NOW Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad. END
BEGIN NOW Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both; END
BEGIN NOW High proof ye now have given to be the race END
BEGIN NOW Of Satan (for I glory in the name, END
BEGIN NOW Antagonist of Heaven's Almighty King,) END
BEGIN NOW Amply have merited of me, of all END
BEGIN NOW The infernal empire, that so near Heaven's door END
BEGIN NOW Triumphal with triumphal act have met, END
BEGIN NOW Mine, with this glorious work; and made one realm, END
BEGIN NOW Hell and this world, one realm, one continent END
BEGIN NOW Of easy thorough-fare. Therefore, while I END
BEGIN NOW Descend through darkness, on your road with ease, END
BEGIN NOW To my associate Powers, them to acquaint END
BEGIN NOW With these successes, and with them rejoice; END
BEGIN NOW You two this way, among these numerous orbs, END
BEGIN NOW All yours, right down to Paradise descend; END
BEGIN NOW There dwell, and reign in bliss; thence on the earth END
BEGIN NOW Dominion exercise and in the air, END
BEGIN NOW Chiefly on Man, sole lord of all declared; END
BEGIN NOW Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. END
BEGIN NOW My substitutes I send ye, and create END
BEGIN NOW Plenipotent on earth, of matchless might END
BEGIN NOW Issuing from me: on your joint vigour now END
BEGIN NOW My hold of this new kingdom all depends, END
BEGIN NOW Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit. END
BEGIN NOW If your joint power prevail, the affairs of Hell END
BEGIN NOW No detriment need fear; go, and be strong! END
BEGIN NOW So saying he dismissed them; they with speed END
BEGIN NOW Their course through thickest constellations held, END
BEGIN NOW Spreading their bane; the blasted stars looked wan, END
BEGIN NOW And planets, planet-struck, real eclipse END
BEGIN NOW Then suffered. The other way Satan went down END
BEGIN NOW The causey to Hell-gate: On either side END
BEGIN NOW Disparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed, END
BEGIN NOW And with rebounding surge the bars assailed, END
BEGIN NOW That scorned his indignation: Through the gate, END
BEGIN NOW Wide open and unguarded, Satan passed, END
BEGIN NOW And all about found desolate; for those, END
BEGIN NOW Appointed to sit there, had left their charge, END
BEGIN NOW Flown to the upper world; the rest were all END
BEGIN NOW Far to the inland retired, about the walls END
BEGIN NOW Of Pandemonium; city and proud seat END
BEGIN NOW Of Lucifer, so by allusion called END
BEGIN NOW Of that bright star to Satan paragoned; END
BEGIN NOW There kept their watch the legions, while the Grand END
BEGIN NOW In council sat, solicitous what chance END
BEGIN NOW Might intercept their emperour sent; so he END
BEGIN NOW Departing gave command, and they observed. END
BEGIN NOW As when the Tartar from his Russian foe, END
BEGIN NOW By Astracan, over the snowy plains, END
BEGIN NOW Retires; or Bactrin Sophi, from the horns END
BEGIN NOW Of Turkish crescent, leaves all waste beyond END
BEGIN NOW The realm of Aladule, in his retreat END
BEGIN NOW To Tauris or Casbeen: So these, the late END
BEGIN NOW Heaven-banished host, left desart utmost Hell END
BEGIN NOW Many a dark league, reduced in careful watch END
BEGIN NOW Round their metropolis; and now expecting END
BEGIN NOW Each hour their great adventurer, from the search END
BEGIN NOW Of foreign worlds: He through the midst unmarked, END
BEGIN NOW In show plebeian Angel militant END
BEGIN NOW Of lowest order, passed; and from the door END
BEGIN NOW Of that Plutonian hall, invisible END
BEGIN NOW Ascended his high throne; which, under state END
BEGIN NOW Of richest texture spread, at the upper end END
BEGIN NOW Was placed in regal lustre. Down a while END
BEGIN NOW He sat, and round about him saw unseen: END
BEGIN NOW At last, as from a cloud, his fulgent head END
BEGIN NOW And shape star-bright appeared, or brighter; clad END
BEGIN NOW With what permissive glory since his fall END
BEGIN NOW Was left him, or false glitter: All amazed END
BEGIN NOW At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng END
BEGIN NOW Bent their aspect, and whom they wished beheld, END
BEGIN NOW Their mighty Chief returned: loud was the acclaim: END
BEGIN NOW Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers, END
BEGIN NOW Raised from their dark Divan, and with like joy END
BEGIN NOW Congratulant approached him; who with hand END
BEGIN NOW Silence, and with these words attention, won. END
BEGIN NOW For in possession such, not only of right, END
BEGIN NOW I call ye, and declare ye now; returned END
BEGIN NOW Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth END
BEGIN NOW Triumphant out of this infernal pit END
BEGIN NOW Abominable, accursed, the house of woe, END
BEGIN NOW And dungeon of our tyrant: Now possess, END
BEGIN NOW As Lords, a spacious world, to our native Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Little inferiour, by my adventure hard END
BEGIN NOW With peril great achieved. Long were to tell END
BEGIN NOW What I have done; what suffered; with what pain END
BEGIN NOW Voyaged th' unreal, vast, unbounded deep END
BEGIN NOW Of horrible confusion; over which END
BEGIN NOW By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved, END
BEGIN NOW To expedite your glorious march; but I END
BEGIN NOW Toiled out my uncouth passage, forced to ride END
BEGIN NOW The untractable abyss, plunged in the womb END
BEGIN NOW Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild; END
BEGIN NOW That, jealous of their secrets, fiercely opposed END
BEGIN NOW My journey strange, with clamorous uproar END
BEGIN NOW Protesting Fate supreme; thence how I found END
BEGIN NOW The new created world, which fame in Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Long had foretold, a fabrick wonderful END
BEGIN NOW Of absolute perfection! therein Man END
BEGIN NOW Placed in a Paradise, by our exile END
BEGIN NOW Made happy: Him by fraud I have seduced END
BEGIN NOW From his Creator; and, the more to encrease END
BEGIN NOW Your wonder, with an apple; he, thereat END
BEGIN NOW Offended, worth your laughter! hath given up END
BEGIN NOW Both his beloved Man, and all his world, END
BEGIN NOW To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, END
BEGIN NOW Without our hazard, labour, or alarm; END
BEGIN NOW To range in, and to dwell, and over Man END
BEGIN NOW To rule, as over all he should have ruled. END
BEGIN NOW True is, me also he hath judged, or rather END
BEGIN NOW Me not, but the brute serpent in whose shape END
BEGIN NOW Man I deceived: that which to me belongs, END
BEGIN NOW Is enmity which he will put between END
BEGIN NOW Me and mankind; I am to bruise his heel; END
BEGIN NOW His seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: END
BEGIN NOW A world who would not purchase with a bruise, END
BEGIN NOW Or much more grievous pain?--Ye have the account END
BEGIN NOW Of my performance: What remains, ye Gods, END
BEGIN NOW But up, and enter now into full bliss? END
BEGIN NOW So having said, a while he stood, expecting END
BEGIN NOW Their universal shout, and high applause, END
BEGIN NOW To fill his ear; when, contrary, he hears END
BEGIN NOW On all sides, from innumerable tongues, END
BEGIN NOW A dismal universal hiss, the sound END
BEGIN NOW Of publick scorn; he wondered, but not long END
BEGIN NOW Had leisure, wondering at himself now more, END
BEGIN NOW His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare; END
BEGIN NOW His arms clung to his ribs; his legs entwining END
BEGIN NOW Each other, till supplanted down he fell END
BEGIN NOW A monstrous serpent on his belly prone, END
BEGIN NOW Reluctant, but in vain; a greater power END
BEGIN NOW Now ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned, END
BEGIN NOW According to his doom: he would have spoke, END
BEGIN NOW But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue END
BEGIN NOW To forked tongue; for now were all transformed END
BEGIN NOW Alike, to serpents all, as accessories END
BEGIN NOW To his bold riot: Dreadful was the din END
BEGIN NOW Of hissing through the hall, thick swarming now END
BEGIN NOW With complicated monsters head and tail, END
BEGIN NOW Scorpion, and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, END
BEGIN NOW Cerastes horned, Hydrus, and Elops drear, END
BEGIN NOW And Dipsas; (not so thick swarmed once the soil END
BEGIN NOW Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the isle END
BEGIN NOW Ophiusa,) but still greatest he the midst, END
BEGIN NOW Now Dragon grown, larger than whom the sun END
BEGIN NOW Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime, END
BEGIN NOW Huge Python, and his power no less he seemed END
BEGIN NOW Above the rest still to retain; they all END
BEGIN NOW Him followed, issuing forth to the open field, END
BEGIN NOW Where all yet left of that revolted rout, END
BEGIN NOW Heaven-fallen, in station stood or just array; END
BEGIN NOW Sublime with expectation when to see END
BEGIN NOW In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief; END
BEGIN NOW They saw, but other sight instead! a croud END
BEGIN NOW Of ugly serpents; horrour on them fell, END
BEGIN NOW And horrid sympathy; for, what they saw, END
BEGIN NOW They felt themselves, now changing; down their arms, END
BEGIN NOW Down fell both spear and shield; down they as fast; END
BEGIN NOW And the dire hiss renewed, and the dire form END
BEGIN NOW Catched, by contagion; like in punishment, END
BEGIN NOW As in their crime. Thus was the applause they meant, END
BEGIN NOW Turned to exploding hiss, triumph to shame END
BEGIN NOW Cast on themselves from their own mouths. There stood END
BEGIN NOW A grove hard by, sprung up with this their change, END
BEGIN NOW His will who reigns above, to aggravate END
BEGIN NOW Their penance, laden with fair fruit, like that END
BEGIN NOW Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve END
BEGIN NOW Used by the Tempter: on that prospect strange END
BEGIN NOW Their earnest eyes they fixed, imagining END
BEGIN NOW For one forbidden tree a multitude END
BEGIN NOW Now risen, to work them further woe or shame; END
BEGIN NOW Yet, parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce, END
BEGIN NOW Though to delude them sent, could not abstain; END
BEGIN NOW But on they rolled in heaps, and, up the trees END
BEGIN NOW Climbing, sat thicker than the snaky locks END
BEGIN NOW That curled Megaera: greedily they plucked END
BEGIN NOW The fruitage fair to sight, like that which grew END
BEGIN NOW Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed; END
BEGIN NOW This more delusive, not the touch, but taste END
BEGIN NOW Deceived; they, fondly thinking to allay END
BEGIN NOW Their appetite with gust, instead of fruit END
BEGIN NOW Chewed bitter ashes, which the offended taste END
BEGIN NOW With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayed, END
BEGIN NOW Hunger and thirst constraining; drugged as oft, END
BEGIN NOW With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws, END
BEGIN NOW With soot and cinders filled; so oft they fell END
BEGIN NOW Into the same illusion, not as Man END
BEGIN NOW Whom they triumphed once lapsed. Thus were they plagued END
BEGIN NOW And worn with famine, long and ceaseless hiss, END
BEGIN NOW Till their lost shape, permitted, they resumed; END
BEGIN NOW Yearly enjoined, some say, to undergo, END
BEGIN NOW This annual humbling certain numbered days, END
BEGIN NOW To dash their pride, and joy, for Man seduced. END
BEGIN NOW However, some tradition they dispersed END
BEGIN NOW Among the Heathen, of their purchase got, END
BEGIN NOW And fabled how the Serpent, whom they called END
BEGIN NOW Ophion, with Eurynome, the wide-- END
BEGIN NOW Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule END
BEGIN NOW Of high Olympus; thence by Saturn driven END
BEGIN NOW And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. END
BEGIN NOW Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair END
BEGIN NOW Too soon arrived; Sin, there in power before, END
BEGIN NOW Once actual; now in body, and to dwell END
BEGIN NOW Habitual habitant; behind her Death, END
BEGIN NOW Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet END
BEGIN NOW On his pale horse: to whom Sin thus began. END
BEGIN NOW Second of Satan sprung, all-conquering Death! END
BEGIN NOW What thinkest thou of our empire now, though earned END
BEGIN NOW With travel difficult, not better far END
BEGIN NOW Than still at Hell's dark threshold to have sat watch, END
BEGIN NOW Unnamed, undreaded, and thyself half starved? END
BEGIN NOW Whom thus the Sin-born monster answered soon. END
BEGIN NOW To me, who with eternal famine pine, END
BEGIN NOW There best, where most with ravine I may meet; END
BEGIN NOW Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems END
BEGIN NOW To stuff this maw, this vast unhide-bound corps. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the incestuous mother thus replied. END
BEGIN NOW Thou therefore on these herbs, and fruits, and flowers, END
BEGIN NOW Feed first; on each beast next, and fish, and fowl; END
BEGIN NOW No homely morsels! and, whatever thing END
BEGIN NOW The sithe of Time mows down, devour unspared; END
BEGIN NOW Till I, in Man residing, through the race, END
BEGIN NOW His thoughts, his looks, words, actions, all infect; END
BEGIN NOW And season him thy last and sweetest prey. END
BEGIN NOW This said, they both betook them several ways, END
BEGIN NOW Both to destroy, or unimmortal make END
BEGIN NOW All kinds, and for destruction to mature END
BEGIN NOW Sooner or later; which the Almighty seeing, END
BEGIN NOW From his transcendent seat the Saints among, END
BEGIN NOW To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice. END
BEGIN NOW See, with what heat these dogs of Hell advance END
BEGIN NOW To waste and havock yonder world, which I END
BEGIN NOW So fair and good created; and had still END
BEGIN NOW Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man END
BEGIN NOW Let in these wasteful furies, who impute END
BEGIN NOW Folly to me; so doth the Prince of Hell END
BEGIN NOW And his adherents, that with so much ease END
BEGIN NOW I suffer them to enter and possess END
BEGIN NOW A place so heavenly; and, conniving, seem END
BEGIN NOW To gratify my scornful enemies, END
BEGIN NOW That laugh, as if, transported with some fit END
BEGIN NOW Of passion, I to them had quitted all, END
BEGIN NOW At random yielded up to their misrule; END
BEGIN NOW And know not that I called, and drew them thither, END
BEGIN NOW My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth END
BEGIN NOW Which Man's polluting sin with taint hath shed END
BEGIN NOW On what was pure; til, crammed and gorged, nigh burst END
BEGIN NOW With sucked and glutted offal, at one sling END
BEGIN NOW Of thy victorious arm, well-pleasing Son, END
BEGIN NOW Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave, at last, END
BEGIN NOW Through Chaos hurled, obstruct the mouth of Hell END
BEGIN NOW For ever, and seal up his ravenous jaws. END
BEGIN NOW Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure END
BEGIN NOW To sanctity, that shall receive no stain: END
BEGIN NOW Till then, the curse pronounced on both precedes. END
BEGIN NOW He ended, and the heavenly audience loud END
BEGIN NOW Sung Halleluiah, as the sound of seas, END
BEGIN NOW Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways, END
BEGIN NOW Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works; END
BEGIN NOW Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son, END
BEGIN NOW Destined Restorer of mankind, by whom END
BEGIN NOW New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise, END
BEGIN NOW Or down from Heaven descend.--Such was their song; END
BEGIN NOW While the Creator, calling forth by name END
BEGIN NOW His mighty Angels, gave them several charge, END
BEGIN NOW As sorted best with present things. The sun END
BEGIN NOW Had first his precept so to move, so shine, END
BEGIN NOW As might affect the earth with cold and heat END
BEGIN NOW Scarce tolerable; and from the north to call END
BEGIN NOW Decrepit winter; from the south to bring END
BEGIN NOW Solstitial summer's heat. To the blanc moon END
BEGIN NOW Her office they prescribed; to the other five END
BEGIN NOW Their planetary motions, and aspects, END
BEGIN NOW In sextile, square, and trine, and opposite, END
BEGIN NOW Of noxious efficacy, and when to join END
BEGIN NOW In synod unbenign; and taught the fixed END
BEGIN NOW Their influence malignant when to shower, END
BEGIN NOW Which of them rising with the sun, or falling, END
BEGIN NOW Should prove tempestuous: To the winds they set END
BEGIN NOW Their corners, when with bluster to confound END
BEGIN NOW Sea, air, and shore; the thunder when to roll END
BEGIN NOW With terrour through the dark aereal hall. END
BEGIN NOW Some say, he bid his Angels turn ascanse END
BEGIN NOW The poles of earth, twice ten degrees and more, END
BEGIN NOW From the sun's axle; they with labour pushed END
BEGIN NOW Oblique the centrick globe: Some say, the sun END
BEGIN NOW Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road END
BEGIN NOW Like distant breadth to Taurus with the seven END
BEGIN NOW Up to the Tropick Crab: thence down amain END
BEGIN NOW As deep as Capricorn; to bring in change END
BEGIN NOW Of seasons to each clime; else had the spring END
BEGIN NOW Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers, END
BEGIN NOW Equal in days and nights, except to those END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the polar circles; to them day END
BEGIN NOW Had unbenighted shone, while the low sun, END
BEGIN NOW To recompense his distance, in their sight END
BEGIN NOW Had rounded still the horizon, and not known END
BEGIN NOW Or east or west; which had forbid the snow END
BEGIN NOW From cold Estotiland, and south as far END
BEGIN NOW Beneath Magellan. At that tasted fruit END
BEGIN NOW The sun, as from Thyestean banquet, turned END
BEGIN NOW His course intended; else, how had the world END
BEGIN NOW Inhabited, though sinless, more than now, END
BEGIN NOW Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat? END
BEGIN NOW These changes in the Heavens, though slow, produced END
BEGIN NOW Like change on sea and land; sideral blast, END
BEGIN NOW Vapour, and mist, and exhalation hot, END
BEGIN NOW Corrupt and pestilent: Now from the north END
BEGIN NOW Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shore, END
BEGIN NOW Bursting their brazen dungeon, armed with ice, END
BEGIN NOW And snow, and hail, and stormy gust and flaw, END
BEGIN NOW Boreas, and Caecias, and Argestes loud, END
BEGIN NOW And Thrascias, rend the woods, and seas upturn; END
BEGIN NOW With adverse blast upturns them from the south END
BEGIN NOW Notus, and Afer black with thunderous clouds END
BEGIN NOW From Serraliona; thwart of these, as fierce, END
BEGIN NOW Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds, END
BEGIN NOW Eurus and Zephyr, with their lateral noise, END
BEGIN NOW Sirocco and Libecchio. Thus began END
BEGIN NOW Outrage from lifeless things; but Discord first, END
BEGIN NOW Daughter of Sin, among the irrational END
BEGIN NOW Death introduced, through fierce antipathy: END
BEGIN NOW Beast now with beast 'gan war, and fowl with fowl, END
BEGIN NOW And fish with fish; to graze the herb all leaving, END
BEGIN NOW Devoured each other; nor stood much in awe END
BEGIN NOW Of Man, but fled him; or, with countenance grim, END
BEGIN NOW Glared on him passing. These were from without END
BEGIN NOW The growing miseries, which Adam saw END
BEGIN NOW Already in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, END
BEGIN NOW To sorrow abandoned, but worse felt within; END
BEGIN NOW And, in a troubled sea of passion tost, END
BEGIN NOW Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint. END
BEGIN NOW O miserable of happy! Is this the end END
BEGIN NOW Of this new glorious world, and me so late END
BEGIN NOW The glory of that glory, who now become END
BEGIN NOW Accursed, of blessed? hide me from the face END
BEGIN NOW Of God, whom to behold was then my highth END
BEGIN NOW Of happiness!--Yet well, if here would end END
BEGIN NOW The misery; I deserved it, and would bear END
BEGIN NOW My own deservings; but this will not serve: END
BEGIN NOW All that I eat or drink, or shall beget, END
BEGIN NOW Is propagated curse. O voice, once heard END
BEGIN NOW Delightfully, Encrease and multiply; END
BEGIN NOW Now death to hear! for what can I encrease, END
BEGIN NOW Or multiply, but curses on my head? END
BEGIN NOW Who of all ages to succeed, but, feeling END
BEGIN NOW The evil on him brought by me, will curse END
BEGIN NOW My head? Ill fare our ancestor impure, END
BEGIN NOW For this we may thank Adam! but his thanks END
BEGIN NOW Shall be the execration: so, besides END
BEGIN NOW Mine own that bide upon me, all from me END
BEGIN NOW Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound; END
BEGIN NOW On me, as on their natural center, light END
BEGIN NOW Heavy, though in their place. O fleeting joys END
BEGIN NOW Of Paradise, dear bought with lasting woes! END
BEGIN NOW Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay END
BEGIN NOW To mould me Man? did I solicit thee END
BEGIN NOW From darkness to promote me, or here place END
BEGIN NOW In this delicious garden? As my will END
BEGIN NOW Concurred not to my being, it were but right END
BEGIN NOW And equal to reduce me to my dust; END
BEGIN NOW Desirous to resign and render back END
BEGIN NOW All I received; unable to perform END
BEGIN NOW Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold END
BEGIN NOW The good I sought not. To the loss of that, END
BEGIN NOW Sufficient penalty, why hast thou added END
BEGIN NOW The sense of endless woes? Inexplicable END
BEGIN NOW Thy justice seems; yet to say truth, too late END
BEGIN NOW I thus contest; then should have been refused END
BEGIN NOW Those terms whatever, when they were proposed: END
BEGIN NOW Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, END
BEGIN NOW Then cavil the conditions? And, though God END
BEGIN NOW Made thee without thy leave, what if thy son END
BEGIN NOW Prove disobedient, and reproved, retort, END
BEGIN NOW Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not! END
BEGIN NOW Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee END
BEGIN NOW That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, END
BEGIN NOW But natural necessity begot. END
BEGIN NOW God made thee of choice his own, and of his own END
BEGIN NOW To serve him; thy reward was of his grace; END
BEGIN NOW Thy punishment then, justly is at his will. END
BEGIN NOW Be it so, for I submit; his doom is fair, END
BEGIN NOW That dust I am, and shall to dust return. END
BEGIN NOW O welcome hour whenever! Why delays END
BEGIN NOW His hand to execute what his decree END
BEGIN NOW Fixed on this day? Why do I overlive, END
BEGIN NOW Why am I mocked with death, and lengthened out END
BEGIN NOW To deathless pain? How gladly would I meet END
BEGIN NOW Mortality my sentence, and be earth END
BEGIN NOW Insensible! How glad would lay me down END
BEGIN NOW As in my mother's lap! There I should rest, END
BEGIN NOW And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more END
BEGIN NOW Would thunder in my ears; no fear of worse END
BEGIN NOW To me, and to my offspring, would torment me END
BEGIN NOW With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt END
BEGIN NOW Pursues me still, lest all I cannot die; END
BEGIN NOW Lest that pure breath of life, the spirit of Man END
BEGIN NOW Which God inspired, cannot together perish END
BEGIN NOW With this corporeal clod; then, in the grave, END
BEGIN NOW Or in some other dismal place, who knows END
BEGIN NOW But I shall die a living death? O thought END
BEGIN NOW Horrid, if true! Yet why? It was but breath END
BEGIN NOW Of life that sinned; what dies but what had life END
BEGIN NOW And sin? The body properly had neither, END
BEGIN NOW All of me then shall die: let this appease END
BEGIN NOW The doubt, since human reach no further knows. END
BEGIN NOW For though the Lord of all be infinite, END
BEGIN NOW Is his wrath also? Be it, Man is not so, END
BEGIN NOW But mortal doomed. How can he exercise END
BEGIN NOW Wrath without end on Man, whom death must end? END
BEGIN NOW Can he make deathless death? That were to make END
BEGIN NOW Strange contradiction, which to God himself END
BEGIN NOW Impossible is held; as argument END
BEGIN NOW Of weakness, not of power. Will he draw out, END
BEGIN NOW For anger's sake, finite to infinite, END
BEGIN NOW In punished Man, to satisfy his rigour, END
BEGIN NOW Satisfied never? That were to extend END
BEGIN NOW His sentence beyond dust and Nature's law; END
BEGIN NOW By which all causes else, according still END
BEGIN NOW To the reception of their matter, act; END
BEGIN NOW Not to the extent of their own sphere. But say END
BEGIN NOW That death be not one stroke, as I supposed, END
BEGIN NOW Bereaving sense, but endless misery END
BEGIN NOW From this day onward; which I feel begun END
BEGIN NOW Both in me, and without me; and so last END
BEGIN NOW To perpetuity;--Ay me! that fear END
BEGIN NOW Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution END
BEGIN NOW On my defenceless head; both Death and I END
BEGIN NOW Am found eternal, and incorporate both; END
BEGIN NOW Nor I on my part single; in me all END
BEGIN NOW Posterity stands cursed: Fair patrimony END
BEGIN NOW That I must leave ye, Sons! O, were I able END
BEGIN NOW To waste it all myself, and leave ye none! END
BEGIN NOW So disinherited, how would you bless END
BEGIN NOW Me, now your curse! Ah, why should all mankind, END
BEGIN NOW For one man's fault, thus guiltless be condemned, END
BEGIN NOW It guiltless? But from me what can proceed, END
BEGIN NOW But all corrupt; both mind and will depraved END
BEGIN NOW Not to do only, but to will the same END
BEGIN NOW With me? How can they then acquitted stand END
BEGIN NOW In sight of God? Him, after all disputes, END
BEGIN NOW Forced I absolve: all my evasions vain, END
BEGIN NOW And reasonings, though through mazes, lead me still END
BEGIN NOW But to my own conviction: first and last END
BEGIN NOW On me, me only, as the source and spring END
BEGIN NOW Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; END
BEGIN NOW So might the wrath! Fond wish! couldst thou support END
BEGIN NOW That burden, heavier than the earth to bear; END
BEGIN NOW Than all the world much heavier, though divided END
BEGIN NOW With that bad Woman? Thus, what thou desirest, END
BEGIN NOW And what thou fearest, alike destroys all hope END
BEGIN NOW Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable END
BEGIN NOW Beyond all past example and future; END
BEGIN NOW To Satan only like both crime and doom. END
BEGIN NOW O Conscience! into what abyss of fears END
BEGIN NOW And horrours hast thou driven me; out of which END
BEGIN NOW I find no way, from deep to deeper plunged! END
BEGIN NOW Thus Adam to himself lamented loud, END
BEGIN NOW Through the still night; not now, as ere Man fell, END
BEGIN NOW Wholesome, and cool, and mild, but with black air END
BEGIN NOW Accompanied; with damps, and dreadful gloom; END
BEGIN NOW Which to his evil conscience represented END
BEGIN NOW All things with double terrour: On the ground END
BEGIN NOW Outstretched he lay, on the cold ground; and oft END
BEGIN NOW Cursed his creation; Death as oft accused END
BEGIN NOW The day of his offence. Why comes not Death, END
BEGIN NOW Said he, with one thrice-acceptable stroke END
BEGIN NOW To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, END
BEGIN NOW Justice Divine not hasten to be just? END
BEGIN NOW But Death comes not at call; Justice Divine END
BEGIN NOW Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries, END
BEGIN NOW O woods, O fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers! END
BEGIN NOW With other echo late I taught your shades END
BEGIN NOW To answer, and resound far other song.-- END
BEGIN NOW Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld, END
BEGIN NOW Desolate where she sat, approaching nigh, END
BEGIN NOW Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed: END
BEGIN NOW But her with stern regard he thus repelled. END
BEGIN NOW Out of my sight, thou Serpent! That name best END
BEGIN NOW Befits thee with him leagued, thyself as false END
BEGIN NOW And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, END
BEGIN NOW Like his, and colour serpentine, may show END
BEGIN NOW Thy inward fraud; to warn all creatures from thee END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth; lest that too heavenly form, pretended END
BEGIN NOW To hellish falshood, snare them! But for thee END
BEGIN NOW I had persisted happy; had not thy pride END
BEGIN NOW And wandering vanity, when least was safe, END
BEGIN NOW Rejected my forewarning, and disdained END
BEGIN NOW Not to be trusted; longing to be seen, END
BEGIN NOW Though by the Devil himself; him overweening END
BEGIN NOW To over-reach; but, with the serpent meeting, END
BEGIN NOW Fooled and beguiled; by him thou, I by thee END
BEGIN NOW To trust thee from my side; imagined wise, END
BEGIN NOW Constant, mature, proof against all assaults; END
BEGIN NOW And understood not all was but a show, END
BEGIN NOW Rather than solid virtue; all but a rib END
BEGIN NOW Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, END
BEGIN NOW More to the part sinister, from me drawn; END
BEGIN NOW Well if thrown out, as supernumerary END
BEGIN NOW To my just number found. O! why did God, END
BEGIN NOW Creator wise, that peopled highest Heaven END
BEGIN NOW With Spirits masculine, create at last END
BEGIN NOW This novelty on earth, this fair defect END
BEGIN NOW Of nature, and not fill the world at once END
BEGIN NOW With Men, as Angels, without feminine; END
BEGIN NOW Or find some other way to generate END
BEGIN NOW Mankind? This mischief had not been befallen, END
BEGIN NOW And more that shall befall; innumerable END
BEGIN NOW Disturbances on earth through female snares, END
BEGIN NOW And strait conjunction with this sex: for either END
BEGIN NOW He never shall find out fit mate, but such END
BEGIN NOW As some misfortune brings him, or mistake; END
BEGIN NOW Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain END
BEGIN NOW Through her perverseness, but shall see her gained END
BEGIN NOW By a far worse; or, if she love, withheld END
BEGIN NOW By parents; or his happiest choice too late END
BEGIN NOW Shall meet, already linked and wedlock-bound END
BEGIN NOW To a fell adversary, his hate or shame: END
BEGIN NOW Which infinite calamity shall cause END
BEGIN NOW To human life, and houshold peace confound. END
BEGIN NOW He added not, and from her turned; but Eve, END
BEGIN NOW Not so repulsed, with tears that ceased not flowing END
BEGIN NOW And tresses all disordered, at his feet END
BEGIN NOW Fell humble; and, embracing them, besought END
BEGIN NOW His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. END
BEGIN NOW Forsake me not thus, Adam! witness Heaven END
BEGIN NOW What love sincere, and reverence in my heart END
BEGIN NOW I bear thee, and unweeting have offended, END
BEGIN NOW Unhappily deceived! Thy suppliant END
BEGIN NOW I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, END
BEGIN NOW Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, END
BEGIN NOW Thy counsel, in this uttermost distress, END
BEGIN NOW My only strength and stay: Forlorn of thee, END
BEGIN NOW Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? END
BEGIN NOW While yet we live, scarce one short hour perhaps, END
BEGIN NOW Between us two let there be peace; both joining, END
BEGIN NOW As joined in injuries, one enmity END
BEGIN NOW Against a foe by doom express assigned us, END
BEGIN NOW That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not END
BEGIN NOW Thy hatred for this misery befallen; END
BEGIN NOW On me already lost, me than thyself END
BEGIN NOW More miserable! Both have sinned; but thou END
BEGIN NOW Against God only; I against God and thee; END
BEGIN NOW And to the place of judgement will return, END
BEGIN NOW There with my cries importune Heaven; that all END
BEGIN NOW The sentence, from thy head removed, may light END
BEGIN NOW On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe; END
BEGIN NOW Me, me only, just object of his ire! END
BEGIN NOW She ended weeping; and her lowly plight, END
BEGIN NOW Immoveable, till peace obtained from fault END
BEGIN NOW Acknowledged and deplored, in Adam wrought END
BEGIN NOW Commiseration: Soon his heart relented END
BEGIN NOW Towards her, his life so late, and sole delight, END
BEGIN NOW Now at his feet submissive in distress; END
BEGIN NOW Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking, END
BEGIN NOW His counsel, whom she had displeased, his aid: END
BEGIN NOW As one disarmed, his anger all he lost, END
BEGIN NOW And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon. END
BEGIN NOW Unwary, and too desirous, as before, END
BEGIN NOW So now of what thou knowest not, who desirest END
BEGIN NOW The punishment all on thyself; alas! END
BEGIN NOW Bear thine own first, ill able to sustain END
BEGIN NOW His full wrath, whose thou feelest as yet least part, END
BEGIN NOW And my displeasure bearest so ill. If prayers END
BEGIN NOW Could alter high decrees, I to that place END
BEGIN NOW Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, END
BEGIN NOW That on my head all might be visited; END
BEGIN NOW Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven, END
BEGIN NOW To me committed, and by me exposed. END
BEGIN NOW But rise;--let us no more contend, nor blame END
BEGIN NOW Each other, blamed enough elsewhere; but strive END
BEGIN NOW In offices of love, how we may lighten END
BEGIN NOW Each other's burden, in our share of woe; END
BEGIN NOW Since this day's death denounced, if aught I see, END
BEGIN NOW Will prove no sudden, but a slow-paced evil; END
BEGIN NOW A long day's dying, to augment our pain; END
BEGIN NOW And to our seed (O hapless seed!) derived. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, replied. END
BEGIN NOW Adam, by sad experiment I know END
BEGIN NOW How little weight my words with thee can find, END
BEGIN NOW Found so erroneous; thence by just event END
BEGIN NOW Found so unfortunate: Nevertheless, END
BEGIN NOW Restored by thee, vile as I am, to place END
BEGIN NOW Of new acceptance, hopeful to regain END
BEGIN NOW Thy love, the sole contentment of my heart END
BEGIN NOW Living or dying, from thee I will not hide END
BEGIN NOW What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen, END
BEGIN NOW Tending to some relief of our extremes, END
BEGIN NOW Or end; though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, END
BEGIN NOW As in our evils, and of easier choice. END
BEGIN NOW If care of our descent perplex us most, END
BEGIN NOW Which must be born to certain woe, devoured END
BEGIN NOW By Death at last; and miserable it is END
BEGIN NOW To be to others cause of misery, END
BEGIN NOW Our own begotten, and of our loins to bring END
BEGIN NOW Into this cursed world a woeful race, END
BEGIN NOW That after wretched life must be at last END
BEGIN NOW Food for so foul a monster; in thy power END
BEGIN NOW It lies, yet ere conception to prevent END
BEGIN NOW The race unblest, to being yet unbegot. END
BEGIN NOW Childless thou art, childless remain: so Death END
BEGIN NOW Shall be deceived his glut, and with us two END
BEGIN NOW Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw. END
BEGIN NOW But if thou judge it hard and difficult, END
BEGIN NOW Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain END
BEGIN NOW From love's due rights, nuptial embraces sweet; END
BEGIN NOW And with desire to languish without hope, END
BEGIN NOW Before the present object languishing END
BEGIN NOW With like desire; which would be misery END
BEGIN NOW And torment less than none of what we dread; END
BEGIN NOW Then, both ourselves and seed at once to free END
BEGIN NOW From what we fear for both, let us make short,-- END
BEGIN NOW Let us seek Death;--or, he not found, supply END
BEGIN NOW With our own hands his office on ourselves: END
BEGIN NOW Why stand we longer shivering under fears, END
BEGIN NOW That show no end but death, and have the power, END
BEGIN NOW Of many ways to die the shortest choosing, END
BEGIN NOW Destruction with destruction to destroy?-- END
BEGIN NOW She ended here, or vehement despair END
BEGIN NOW Broke off the rest: so much of death her thoughts END
BEGIN NOW Had entertained, as dyed her cheeks with pale. END
BEGIN NOW But Adam, with such counsel nothing swayed, END
BEGIN NOW To better hopes his more attentive mind END
BEGIN NOW Labouring had raised; and thus to Eve replied. END
BEGIN NOW Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems END
BEGIN NOW To argue in thee something more sublime END
BEGIN NOW And excellent, than what thy mind contemns; END
BEGIN NOW But self-destruction therefore sought, refutes END
BEGIN NOW That excellence thought in thee; and implies, END
BEGIN NOW Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret END
BEGIN NOW For loss of life and pleasure overloved. END
BEGIN NOW Or if thou covet death, as utmost end END
BEGIN NOW Of misery, so thinking to evade END
BEGIN NOW The penalty pronounced; doubt not but God END
BEGIN NOW Hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire, than so END
BEGIN NOW To be forestalled; much more I fear lest death, END
BEGIN NOW So snatched, will not exempt us from the pain END
BEGIN NOW We are by doom to pay; rather, such acts END
BEGIN NOW Of contumacy will provoke the Highest END
BEGIN NOW To make death in us live: Then let us seek END
BEGIN NOW Some safer resolution, which methinks END
BEGIN NOW I have in view, calling to mind with heed END
BEGIN NOW Part of our sentence, that thy seed shall bruise END
BEGIN NOW The Serpent's head; piteous amends! unless END
BEGIN NOW Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand foe, END
BEGIN NOW Satan; who, in the serpent, hath contrived END
BEGIN NOW Against us this deceit: To crush his head END
BEGIN NOW Would be revenge indeed! which will be lost END
BEGIN NOW By death brought on ourselves, or childless days END
BEGIN NOW Resolved, as thou proposest; so our foe END
BEGIN NOW Shal 'scape his punishment ordained, and we END
BEGIN NOW Instead shall double ours upon our heads. END
BEGIN NOW No more be mentioned then of violence END
BEGIN NOW Against ourselves; and wilful barrenness, END
BEGIN NOW That cuts us off from hope; and savours only END
BEGIN NOW Rancour and pride, impatience and despite, END
BEGIN NOW Reluctance against God and his just yoke END
BEGIN NOW Laid on our necks. Remember with what mild END
BEGIN NOW And gracious temper he both heard, and judged, END
BEGIN NOW Without wrath or reviling; we expected END
BEGIN NOW Immediate dissolution, which we thought END
BEGIN NOW Was meant by death that day; when lo! to thee END
BEGIN NOW Pains only in child-bearing were foretold, END
BEGIN NOW And bringing forth; soon recompensed with joy, END
BEGIN NOW Fruit of thy womb: On me the curse aslope END
BEGIN NOW Glanced on the ground; with labour I must earn END
BEGIN NOW My bread; what harm? Idleness had been worse; END
BEGIN NOW My labour will sustain me; and, lest cold END
BEGIN NOW Or heat should injure us, his timely care END
BEGIN NOW Hath, unbesought, provided; and his hands END
BEGIN NOW Clothed us unworthy, pitying while he judged; END
BEGIN NOW How much more, if we pray him, will his ear END
BEGIN NOW Be open, and his heart to pity incline, END
BEGIN NOW And teach us further by what means to shun END
BEGIN NOW The inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and snow! END
BEGIN NOW Which now the sky, with various face, begins END
BEGIN NOW To show us in this mountain; while the winds END
BEGIN NOW Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks END
BEGIN NOW Of these fair spreading trees; which bids us seek END
BEGIN NOW Some better shroud, some better warmth to cherish END
BEGIN NOW Our limbs benummed, ere this diurnal star END
BEGIN NOW Leave cold the night, how we his gathered beams END
BEGIN NOW Reflected may with matter sere foment; END
BEGIN NOW Or, by collision of two bodies, grind END
BEGIN NOW The air attrite to fire; as late the clouds END
BEGIN NOW Justling, or pushed with winds, rude in their shock, END
BEGIN NOW Tine the slant lightning; whose thwart flame, driven down END
BEGIN NOW Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine; END
BEGIN NOW And sends a comfortable heat from far, END
BEGIN NOW Which might supply the sun: Such fire to use, END
BEGIN NOW And what may else be remedy or cure END
BEGIN NOW To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought, END
BEGIN NOW He will instruct us praying, and of grace END
BEGIN NOW Beseeching him; so as we need not fear END
BEGIN NOW To pass commodiously this life, sustained END
BEGIN NOW By him with many comforts, till we end END
BEGIN NOW In dust, our final rest and native home. END
BEGIN NOW What better can we do, than, to the place END
BEGIN NOW Repairing where he judged us, prostrate fall END
BEGIN NOW Before him reverent; and there confess END
BEGIN NOW Humbly our faults, and pardon beg; with tears END
BEGIN NOW Watering the ground, and with our sighs the air END
BEGIN NOW Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign END
BEGIN NOW Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek. END
BEGIN NOW Undoubtedly he will relent, and turn END
BEGIN NOW From his displeasure; in whose look serene, END
BEGIN NOW When angry most he seemed and most severe, END
BEGIN NOW What else but favour, grace, and mercy, shone? END
BEGIN NOW So spake our father penitent; nor Eve END
BEGIN NOW Felt less remorse: they, forthwith to the place END
BEGIN NOW Repairing where he judged them, prostrate fell END
BEGIN NOW Before him reverent; and both confessed END
BEGIN NOW Humbly their faults, and pardon begged; with tears END
BEGIN NOW Watering the ground, and with their sighs the air END
BEGIN NOW Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign END
BEGIN NOW Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek. END
BEGIN NOW Thus they, in lowliest plight, repentant stood END
BEGIN NOW Praying; for from the mercy-seat above END
BEGIN NOW Prevenient grace descending had removed END
BEGIN NOW The stony from their hearts, and made new flesh END
BEGIN NOW Regenerate grow instead; that sighs now breathed END
BEGIN NOW Unutterable; which the Spirit of prayer END
BEGIN NOW Inspired, and winged for Heaven with speedier flight END
BEGIN NOW Than loudest oratory: Yet their port END
BEGIN NOW Not of mean suitors; nor important less END
BEGIN NOW Seemed their petition, than when the ancient pair END
BEGIN NOW In fables old, less ancient yet than these, END
BEGIN NOW Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha, to restore END
BEGIN NOW The race of mankind drowned, before the shrine END
BEGIN NOW Of Themis stood devout. To Heaven their prayers END
BEGIN NOW Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious winds END
BEGIN NOW Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passed END
BEGIN NOW Dimensionless through heavenly doors; then clad END
BEGIN NOW With incense, where the golden altar fumed, END
BEGIN NOW By their great intercessour, came in sight END
BEGIN NOW Before the Father's throne: them the glad Son END
BEGIN NOW Presenting, thus to intercede began. END
BEGIN NOW See Father, what first-fruits on earth are sprung END
BEGIN NOW From thy implanted grace in Man; these sighs END
BEGIN NOW And prayers, which in this golden censer mixed END
BEGIN NOW With incense, I thy priest before thee bring; END
BEGIN NOW Fruits of more pleasing savour, from thy seed END
BEGIN NOW Sown with contrition in his heart, than those END
BEGIN NOW Which, his own hand manuring, all the trees END
BEGIN NOW Of Paradise could have produced, ere fallen END
BEGIN NOW From innocence. Now therefore, bend thine ear END
BEGIN NOW To supplication; hear his sighs, though mute; END
BEGIN NOW Unskilful with what words to pray, let me END
BEGIN NOW Interpret for him; me, his advocate END
BEGIN NOW And propitiation; all his works on me, END
BEGIN NOW Good, or not good, ingraft; my merit those END
BEGIN NOW Shall perfect, and for these my death shall pay. END
BEGIN NOW Accept me; and, in me, from these receive END
BEGIN NOW The smell of peace toward mankind: let him live END
BEGIN NOW Before thee reconciled, at least his days END
BEGIN NOW Numbered, though sad; till death, his doom, (which I END
BEGIN NOW To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse,) END
BEGIN NOW To better life shall yield him: where with me END
BEGIN NOW All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss; END
BEGIN NOW Made one with me, as I with thee am one. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Father, without cloud, serene. END
BEGIN NOW All thy request for Man, accepted Son, END
BEGIN NOW Obtain; all thy request was my decree: END
BEGIN NOW But, longer in that Paradise to dwell, END
BEGIN NOW The law I gave to Nature him forbids: END
BEGIN NOW Those pure immortal elements, that know, END
BEGIN NOW No gross, no unharmonious mixture foul, END
BEGIN NOW Eject him, tainted now; and purge him off, END
BEGIN NOW As a distemper, gross, to air as gross, END
BEGIN NOW And mortal food; as may dispose him best END
BEGIN NOW For dissolution wrought by sin, that first END
BEGIN NOW Distempered all things, and of incorrupt END
BEGIN NOW Corrupted. I, at first, with two fair gifts END
BEGIN NOW Created him endowed; with happiness, END
BEGIN NOW And immortality: that fondly lost, END
BEGIN NOW This other served but to eternize woe; END
BEGIN NOW Till I provided death: so death becomes END
BEGIN NOW His final remedy; and, after life, END
BEGIN NOW Tried in sharp tribulation, and refined END
BEGIN NOW By faith and faithful works, to second life, END
BEGIN NOW Waked in the renovation of the just, END
BEGIN NOW Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed. END
BEGIN NOW But let us call to synod all the Blest, END
BEGIN NOW Through Heaven's wide bounds: from them I will not hide END
BEGIN NOW My judgements; how with mankind I proceed, END
BEGIN NOW As how with peccant Angels late they saw, END
BEGIN NOW And in their state, though firm, stood more confirmed. END
BEGIN NOW He ended, and the Son gave signal high END
BEGIN NOW To the bright minister that watched; he blew END
BEGIN NOW His trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps END
BEGIN NOW When God descended, and perhaps once more END
BEGIN NOW To sound at general doom. The angelick blast END
BEGIN NOW Filled all the regions: from their blisful bowers END
BEGIN NOW Of amarantine shade, fountain or spring, END
BEGIN NOW By the waters of life, where'er they sat END
BEGIN NOW In fellowships of joy, the sons of light END
BEGIN NOW Hasted, resorting to the summons high; END
BEGIN NOW And took their seats; till from his throne supreme END
BEGIN NOW The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will. END
BEGIN NOW O Sons, like one of us Man is become END
BEGIN NOW To know both good and evil, since his taste END
BEGIN NOW Of that defended fruit; but let him boast END
BEGIN NOW His knowledge of good lost, and evil got; END
BEGIN NOW Happier! had it sufficed him to have known END
BEGIN NOW Good by itself, and evil not at all. END
BEGIN NOW He sorrows now, repents, and prays contrite, END
BEGIN NOW My motions in him; longer than they move, END
BEGIN NOW His heart I know, how variable and vain, END
BEGIN NOW Self-left. Lest therefore his now bolder hand END
BEGIN NOW Reach also of the tree of life, and eat, END
BEGIN NOW And live for ever, dream at least to live END
BEGIN NOW For ever, to remove him I decree, END
BEGIN NOW And send him from the garden forth to till END
BEGIN NOW The ground whence he was taken, fitter soil. END
BEGIN NOW Michael, this my behest have thou in charge; END
BEGIN NOW Take to thee from among the Cherubim END
BEGIN NOW Thy choice of flaming warriours, lest the Fiend, END
BEGIN NOW Or in behalf of Man, or to invade END
BEGIN NOW Vacant possession, some new trouble raise: END
BEGIN NOW Haste thee, and from the Paradise of God END
BEGIN NOW Without remorse drive out the sinful pair; END
BEGIN NOW From hallowed ground the unholy; and denounce END
BEGIN NOW To them, and to their progeny, from thence END
BEGIN NOW Perpetual banishment. Yet, lest they faint END
BEGIN NOW At the sad sentence rigorously urged, END
BEGIN NOW (For I behold them softened, and with tears END
BEGIN NOW Bewailing their excess,) all terrour hide. END
BEGIN NOW If patiently thy bidding they obey, END
BEGIN NOW Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveal END
BEGIN NOW To Adam what shall come in future days, END
BEGIN NOW As I shall thee enlighten; intermix END
BEGIN NOW My covenant in the Woman's seed renewed; END
BEGIN NOW So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace: END
BEGIN NOW And on the east side of the garden place, END
BEGIN NOW Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs, END
BEGIN NOW Cherubick watch; and of a sword the flame END
BEGIN NOW Wide-waving; all approach far off to fright, END
BEGIN NOW And guard all passage to the tree of life: END
BEGIN NOW Lest Paradise a receptacle prove END
BEGIN NOW To Spirits foul, and all my trees their prey; END
BEGIN NOW With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude. END
BEGIN NOW He ceased; and the arch-angelick Power prepared END
BEGIN NOW For swift descent; with him the cohort bright END
BEGIN NOW Of watchful Cherubim: four faces each END
BEGIN NOW Had, like a double Janus; all their shape END
BEGIN NOW Spangled with eyes more numerous than those END
BEGIN NOW Of Argus, and more wakeful than to drouse, END
BEGIN NOW Charmed with Arcadian pipe, the pastoral reed END
BEGIN NOW Of Hermes, or his opiate rod. Mean while, END
BEGIN NOW To re-salute the world with sacred light, END
BEGIN NOW Leucothea waked; and with fresh dews imbalmed END
BEGIN NOW The earth; when Adam and first matron Eve END
BEGIN NOW Had ended now their orisons, and found END
BEGIN NOW Strength added from above; new hope to spring END
BEGIN NOW Out of despair; joy, but with fear yet linked; END
BEGIN NOW Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed. END
BEGIN NOW Eve, easily my faith admit, that all END
BEGIN NOW The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends; END
BEGIN NOW But, that from us aught should ascend to Heaven END
BEGIN NOW So prevalent as to concern the mind END
BEGIN NOW Of God high-blest, or to incline his will, END
BEGIN NOW Hard to belief may seem; yet this will prayer END
BEGIN NOW Or one short sigh of human breath, upborne END
BEGIN NOW Even to the seat of God. For since I sought END
BEGIN NOW By prayer the offended Deity to appease; END
BEGIN NOW Kneeled, and before him humbled all my heart; END
BEGIN NOW Methought I saw him placable and mild, END
BEGIN NOW Bending his ear; persuasion in me grew END
BEGIN NOW That I was heard with favour; peace returned END
BEGIN NOW Home to my breast, and to my memory END
BEGIN NOW His promise, that thy seed shall bruise our foe; END
BEGIN NOW Which, then not minded in dismay, yet now END
BEGIN NOW Assures me that the bitterness of death END
BEGIN NOW Is past, and we shall live. Whence hail to thee, END
BEGIN NOW Eve rightly called, mother of all mankind, END
BEGIN NOW Mother of all things living, since by thee END
BEGIN NOW Man is to live; and all things live for Man. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek. END
BEGIN NOW Ill-worthy I such title should belong END
BEGIN NOW To me transgressour; who, for thee ordained END
BEGIN NOW A help, became thy snare; to me reproach END
BEGIN NOW Rather belongs, distrust, and all dispraise: END
BEGIN NOW But infinite in pardon was my Judge, END
BEGIN NOW That I, who first brought death on all, am graced END
BEGIN NOW The source of life; next favourable thou, END
BEGIN NOW Who highly thus to entitle me vouchsaf'st, END
BEGIN NOW Far other name deserving. But the field END
BEGIN NOW To labour calls us, now with sweat imposed, END
BEGIN NOW Though after sleepless night; for see! the morn, END
BEGIN NOW All unconcerned with our unrest, begins END
BEGIN NOW Her rosy progress smiling: let us forth; END
BEGIN NOW I never from thy side henceforth to stray, END
BEGIN NOW Where'er our day's work lies, though now enjoined END
BEGIN NOW Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, END
BEGIN NOW What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks? END
BEGIN NOW Here let us live, though in fallen state, content. END
BEGIN NOW So spake, so wished much humbled Eve; but Fate END
BEGIN NOW Subscribed not: Nature first gave signs, impressed END
BEGIN NOW On bird, beast, air; air suddenly eclipsed, END
BEGIN NOW After short blush of morn; nigh in her sight END
BEGIN NOW The bird of Jove, stooped from his aery tour, END
BEGIN NOW Two birds of gayest plume before him drove; END
BEGIN NOW Down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods, END
BEGIN NOW First hunter then, pursued a gentle brace, END
BEGIN NOW Goodliest of all the forest, hart and hind; END
BEGIN NOW Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight. END
BEGIN NOW Adam observed, and with his eye the chase END
BEGIN NOW Pursuing, not unmoved, to Eve thus spake. END
BEGIN NOW O Eve, some further change awaits us nigh, END
BEGIN NOW Which Heaven, by these mute signs in Nature, shows END
BEGIN NOW Forerunners of his purpose; or to warn END
BEGIN NOW Us, haply too secure, of our discharge END
BEGIN NOW From penalty, because from death released END
BEGIN NOW Some days: how long, and what till then our life, END
BEGIN NOW Who knows? or more than this, that we are dust, END
BEGIN NOW And thither must return, and be no more? END
BEGIN NOW Why else this double object in our sight END
BEGIN NOW Of flight pursued in the air, and o'er the ground, END
BEGIN NOW One way the self-same hour? why in the east END
BEGIN NOW Darkness ere day's mid-course, and morning-light END
BEGIN NOW More orient in yon western cloud, that draws END
BEGIN NOW O'er the blue firmament a radiant white, END
BEGIN NOW And slow descends with something heavenly fraught? END
BEGIN NOW He erred not; for by this the heavenly bands END
BEGIN NOW Down from a sky of jasper lighted now END
BEGIN NOW In Paradise, and on a hill made halt; END
BEGIN NOW A glorious apparition, had not doubt END
BEGIN NOW And carnal fear that day dimmed Adam's eye. END
BEGIN NOW Not that more glorious, when the Angels met END
BEGIN NOW Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw END
BEGIN NOW The field pavilioned with his guardians bright; END
BEGIN NOW Nor that, which on the flaming mount appeared END
BEGIN NOW In Dothan, covered with a camp of fire, END
BEGIN NOW Against the Syrian king, who to surprise END
BEGIN NOW One man, assassin-like, had levied war, END
BEGIN NOW War unproclaimed. The princely Hierarch END
BEGIN NOW In their bright stand there left his Powers, to seise END
BEGIN NOW Possession of the garden; he alone, END
BEGIN NOW To find where Adam sheltered, took his way, END
BEGIN NOW Not unperceived of Adam; who to Eve, END
BEGIN NOW While the great visitant approached, thus spake. END
BEGIN NOW Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps END
BEGIN NOW Of us will soon determine, or impose END
BEGIN NOW New laws to be observed; for I descry, END
BEGIN NOW From yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill, END
BEGIN NOW One of the heavenly host; and, by his gait, END
BEGIN NOW None of the meanest; some great Potentate END
BEGIN NOW Or of the Thrones above; such majesty END
BEGIN NOW Invests him coming! yet not terrible, END
BEGIN NOW That I should fear; nor sociably mild, END
BEGIN NOW As Raphael, that I should much confide; END
BEGIN NOW But solemn and sublime; whom not to offend, END
BEGIN NOW With reverence I must meet, and thou retire. END
BEGIN NOW He ended: and the Arch-Angel soon drew nigh, END
BEGIN NOW Not in his shape celestial, but as man END
BEGIN NOW Clad to meet man; over his lucid arms END
BEGIN NOW A military vest of purple flowed, END
BEGIN NOW Livelier than Meliboean, or the grain END
BEGIN NOW Of Sarra, worn by kings and heroes old END
BEGIN NOW In time of truce; Iris had dipt the woof; END
BEGIN NOW His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime END
BEGIN NOW In manhood where youth ended; by his side, END
BEGIN NOW As in a glistering zodiack, hung the sword, END
BEGIN NOW Satan's dire dread; and in his hand the spear. END
BEGIN NOW Adam bowed low; he, kingly, from his state END
BEGIN NOW Inclined not, but his coming thus declared. END
BEGIN NOW Adam, Heaven's high behest no preface needs: END
BEGIN NOW Sufficient that thy prayers are heard; and Death, END
BEGIN NOW Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, END
BEGIN NOW Defeated of his seisure many days END
BEGIN NOW Given thee of grace; wherein thou mayest repent, END
BEGIN NOW And one bad act with many deeds well done END
BEGIN NOW Mayest cover: Well may then thy Lord, appeased, END
BEGIN NOW Redeem thee quite from Death's rapacious claim; END
BEGIN NOW But longer in this Paradise to dwell END
BEGIN NOW Permits not: to remove thee I am come, END
BEGIN NOW And send thee from the garden forth to till END
BEGIN NOW The ground whence thou wast taken, fitter soil. END
BEGIN NOW He added not; for Adam at the news END
BEGIN NOW Heart-struck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, END
BEGIN NOW That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen END
BEGIN NOW Yet all had heard, with audible lament END
BEGIN NOW Discovered soon the place of her retire. END
BEGIN NOW O unexpected stroke, worse than of Death! END
BEGIN NOW Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave END
BEGIN NOW Thee, native soil! these happy walks and shades, END
BEGIN NOW Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, END
BEGIN NOW Quiet though sad, the respite of that day END
BEGIN NOW That must be mortal to us both. O flowers, END
BEGIN NOW That never will in other climate grow, END
BEGIN NOW My early visitation, and my last END
BEGIN NOW At even, which I bred up with tender hand END
BEGIN NOW From the first opening bud, and gave ye names, END
BEGIN NOW Who now shall rear ye to the sun, or rank END
BEGIN NOW Your tribes, and water from the ambrosial fount? END
BEGIN NOW Thee lastly, nuptial bower! by me adorned END
BEGIN NOW With what to sight or smell was sweet! from thee END
BEGIN NOW How shall I part, and whither wander down END
BEGIN NOW Into a lower world; to this obscure END
BEGIN NOW And wild, how shall we breathe in other air END
BEGIN NOW Less pure, accustomed to immortal fruits? END
BEGIN NOW Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild. END
BEGIN NOW Lament not, Eve, but patiently resign END
BEGIN NOW What justly thou hast lost, nor set thy heart, END
BEGIN NOW Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine: END
BEGIN NOW Thy going is not lonely; with thee goes END
BEGIN NOW Thy husband; whom to follow thou art bound; END
BEGIN NOW Where he abides, think there thy native soil. END
BEGIN NOW Adam, by this from the cold sudden damp END
BEGIN NOW Recovering, and his scattered spirits returned, END
BEGIN NOW To Michael thus his humble words addressed. END
BEGIN NOW Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or named END
BEGIN NOW Of them the highest; for such of shape may seem END
BEGIN NOW Prince above princes! gently hast thou told END
BEGIN NOW Thy message, which might else in telling wound, END
BEGIN NOW And in performing end us; what besides END
BEGIN NOW Of sorrow, and dejection, and despair, END
BEGIN NOW Our frailty can sustain, thy tidings bring, END
BEGIN NOW Departure from this happy place, our sweet END
BEGIN NOW Recess, and only consolation left END
BEGIN NOW Familiar to our eyes! all places else END
BEGIN NOW Inhospitable appear, and desolate; END
BEGIN NOW Nor knowing us, nor known: And, if by prayer END
BEGIN NOW Incessant I could hope to change the will END
BEGIN NOW Of Him who all things can, I would not cease END
BEGIN NOW To weary him with my assiduous cries: END
BEGIN NOW But prayer against his absolute decree END
BEGIN NOW No more avails than breath against the wind, END
BEGIN NOW Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth: END
BEGIN NOW Therefore to his great bidding I submit. END
BEGIN NOW This most afflicts me, that, departing hence, END
BEGIN NOW As from his face I shall be hid, deprived END
BEGIN NOW His blessed countenance: Here I could frequent END
BEGIN NOW With worship place by place where he vouchsafed END
BEGIN NOW Presence Divine; and to my sons relate, END
BEGIN NOW On this mount he appeared; under this tree END
BEGIN NOW Stood visible; among these pines his voice END
BEGIN NOW I heard; here with him at this fountain talked: END
BEGIN NOW So many grateful altars I would rear END
BEGIN NOW Of grassy turf, and pile up every stone END
BEGIN NOW Of lustre from the brook, in memory, END
BEGIN NOW Or monument to ages; and theron END
BEGIN NOW Offer sweet-smelling gums, and fruits, and flowers: END
BEGIN NOW In yonder nether world where shall I seek END
BEGIN NOW His bright appearances, or foot-step trace? END
BEGIN NOW For though I fled him angry, yet recalled END
BEGIN NOW To life prolonged and promised race, I now END
BEGIN NOW Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts END
BEGIN NOW Of glory; and far off his steps adore. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Michael with regard benign. END
BEGIN NOW Adam, thou knowest Heaven his, and all the Earth; END
BEGIN NOW Not this rock only; his Omnipresence fills END
BEGIN NOW Land, sea, and air, and every kind that lives, END
BEGIN NOW Fomented by his virtual power and warmed: END
BEGIN NOW All the earth he gave thee to possess and rule, END
BEGIN NOW No despicable gift; surmise not then END
BEGIN NOW His presence to these narrow bounds confined END
BEGIN NOW Of Paradise, or Eden: this had been END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps thy capital seat, from whence had spread END
BEGIN NOW All generations; and had hither come END
BEGIN NOW From all the ends of the earth, to celebrate END
BEGIN NOW And reverence thee, their great progenitor. END
BEGIN NOW But this pre-eminence thou hast lost, brought down END
BEGIN NOW To dwell on even ground now with thy sons: END
BEGIN NOW Yet doubt not but in valley, and in plain, END
BEGIN NOW God is, as here; and will be found alike END
BEGIN NOW Present; and of his presence many a sign END
BEGIN NOW Still following thee, still compassing thee round END
BEGIN NOW With goodness and paternal love, his face END
BEGIN NOW Express, and of his steps the track divine. END
BEGIN NOW Which that thou mayest believe, and be confirmed END
BEGIN NOW Ere thou from hence depart; know, I am sent END
BEGIN NOW To show thee what shall come in future days END
BEGIN NOW To thee, and to thy offspring: good with bad END
BEGIN NOW Expect to hear; supernal grace contending END
BEGIN NOW With sinfulness of men; thereby to learn END
BEGIN NOW True patience, and to temper joy with fear END
BEGIN NOW And pious sorrow; equally inured END
BEGIN NOW By moderation either state to bear, END
BEGIN NOW Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead END
BEGIN NOW Safest thy life, and best prepared endure END
BEGIN NOW Thy mortal passage when it comes.--Ascend END
BEGIN NOW This hill; let Eve (for I have drenched her eyes) END
BEGIN NOW Here sleep below; while thou to foresight wakest; END
BEGIN NOW As once thou sleptst, while she to life was formed. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Adam gratefully replied. END
BEGIN NOW Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path END
BEGIN NOW Thou leadest me; and to the hand of Heaven submit, END
BEGIN NOW However chastening; to the evil turn END
BEGIN NOW My obvious breast; arming to overcome END
BEGIN NOW By suffering, and earn rest from labour won, END
BEGIN NOW If so I may attain.--So both ascend END
BEGIN NOW In the visions of God. It was a hill, END
BEGIN NOW Of Paradise the highest; from whose top END
BEGIN NOW The hemisphere of earth, in clearest ken, END
BEGIN NOW Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay. END
BEGIN NOW Not higher that hill, nor wider looking round, END
BEGIN NOW Whereon, for different cause, the Tempter set END
BEGIN NOW Our second Adam, in the wilderness; END
BEGIN NOW To show him all Earth's kingdoms, and their glory. END
BEGIN NOW His eye might there command wherever stood END
BEGIN NOW City of old or modern fame, the seat END
BEGIN NOW Of mightiest empire, from the destined walls END
BEGIN NOW Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can, END
BEGIN NOW And Samarchand by Oxus, Temir's throne, END
BEGIN NOW To Paquin of Sinaean kings; and thence END
BEGIN NOW To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul, END
BEGIN NOW Down to the golden Chersonese; or where END
BEGIN NOW The Persian in Ecbatan sat, or since END
BEGIN NOW In Hispahan; or where the Russian Ksar END
BEGIN NOW Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken END
BEGIN NOW The empire of Negus to his utmost port END
BEGIN NOW Ercoco, and the less maritim kings END
BEGIN NOW And Sofala, thought Ophir, to the realm END
BEGIN NOW Of Congo, and Angola farthest south; END
BEGIN NOW Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount END
BEGIN NOW The kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus, END
BEGIN NOW On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway END
BEGIN NOW The world: in spirit perhaps he also saw END
BEGIN NOW Rich Mexico, the seat of Montezume, END
BEGIN NOW And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat END
BEGIN NOW Of Atabalipa; and yet unspoiled END
BEGIN NOW Guiana, whose great city Geryon's sons END
BEGIN NOW Call El Dorado. But to nobler sights END
BEGIN NOW Michael from Adam's eyes the film removed, END
BEGIN NOW Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight END
BEGIN NOW Had bred; then purged with euphrasy and rue END
BEGIN NOW The visual nerve, for he had much to see; END
BEGIN NOW And from the well of life three drops instilled. END
BEGIN NOW So deep the power of these ingredients pierced, END
BEGIN NOW Even to the inmost seat of mental sight, END
BEGIN NOW That Adam, now enforced to close his eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Sunk down, and all his spirits became entranced; END
BEGIN NOW But him the gentle Angel by the hand END
BEGIN NOW Soon raised, and his attention thus recalled. END
BEGIN NOW Adam, now ope thine eyes; and first behold END
BEGIN NOW The effects, which thy original crime hath wrought END
BEGIN NOW In some to spring from thee; who never touched END
BEGIN NOW The excepted tree; nor with the snake conspired; END
BEGIN NOW Nor sinned thy sin; yet from that sin derive END
BEGIN NOW Corruption, to bring forth more violent deeds. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes he opened, and beheld a field, END
BEGIN NOW Part arable and tilth, whereon were sheaves END
BEGIN NOW New reaped; the other part sheep-walks and folds; END
BEGIN NOW I' the midst an altar as the land-mark stood, END
BEGIN NOW Rustick, of grassy sord; thither anon END
BEGIN NOW A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought END
BEGIN NOW First fruits, the green ear, and the yellow sheaf, END
BEGIN NOW Unculled, as came to hand; a shepherd next, END
BEGIN NOW More meek, came with the firstlings of his flock, END
BEGIN NOW Choicest and best; then, sacrificing, laid END
BEGIN NOW The inwards and their fat, with incense strowed, END
BEGIN NOW On the cleft wood, and all due rights performed: END
BEGIN NOW His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Consumed with nimble glance, and grateful steam; END
BEGIN NOW The other's not, for his was not sincere; END
BEGIN NOW Whereat he inly raged, and, as they talked, END
BEGIN NOW Smote him into the midriff with a stone END
BEGIN NOW That beat out life; he fell; and, deadly pale, END
BEGIN NOW Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused. END
BEGIN NOW Much at that sight was Adam in his heart END
BEGIN NOW Dismayed, and thus in haste to the Angel cried. END
BEGIN NOW O Teacher, some great mischief hath befallen END
BEGIN NOW To that meek man, who well had sacrificed; END
BEGIN NOW Is piety thus and pure devotion paid? END
BEGIN NOW To whom Michael thus, he also moved, replied. END
BEGIN NOW These two are brethren, Adam, and to come END
BEGIN NOW Out of thy loins; the unjust the just hath slain, END
BEGIN NOW For envy that his brother's offering found END
BEGIN NOW From Heaven acceptance; but the bloody fact END
BEGIN NOW Will be avenged; and the other's faith, approved, END
BEGIN NOW Lose no reward; though here thou see him die, END
BEGIN NOW Rolling in dust and gore. To which our sire. END
BEGIN NOW Alas! both for the deed, and for the cause! END
BEGIN NOW But have I now seen Death? Is this the way END
BEGIN NOW I must return to native dust? O sight END
BEGIN NOW Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, END
BEGIN NOW Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen END
BEGIN NOW In his first shape on Man; but many shapes END
BEGIN NOW Of Death, and many are the ways that lead END
BEGIN NOW To his grim cave, all dismal; yet to sense END
BEGIN NOW More terrible at the entrance, than within. END
BEGIN NOW Some, as thou sawest, by violent stroke shall die; END
BEGIN NOW By fire, flood, famine, by intemperance more END
BEGIN NOW In meats and drinks, which on the earth shall bring END
BEGIN NOW Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew END
BEGIN NOW Before thee shall appear; that thou mayest know END
BEGIN NOW What misery the inabstinence of Eve END
BEGIN NOW Shall bring on Men. Immediately a place END
BEGIN NOW Before his eyes appeared, sad, noisome, dark; END
BEGIN NOW A lazar-house it seemed; wherein were laid END
BEGIN NOW Numbers of all diseased; all maladies END
BEGIN NOW Of ghastly spasm, or racking torture, qualms END
BEGIN NOW Of heart-sick agony, all feverous kinds, END
BEGIN NOW Convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs, END
BEGIN NOW Intestine stone and ulcer, colick-pangs, END
BEGIN NOW Demoniack phrenzy, moaping melancholy, END
BEGIN NOW And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy, END
BEGIN NOW Marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence, END
BEGIN NOW Dropsies, and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums. END
BEGIN NOW Dire was the tossing, deep the groans; Despair END
BEGIN NOW Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch; END
BEGIN NOW And over them triumphant Death his dart END
BEGIN NOW Shook, but delayed to strike, though oft invoked END
BEGIN NOW With vows, as their chief good, and final hope. END
BEGIN NOW Sight so deform what heart of rock could long END
BEGIN NOW Dry-eyed behold? Adam could not, but wept, END
BEGIN NOW Though not of woman born; compassion quelled END
BEGIN NOW His best of man, and gave him up to tears END
BEGIN NOW A space, till firmer thoughts restrained excess; END
BEGIN NOW And, scarce recovering words, his plaint renewed. END
BEGIN NOW O miserable mankind, to what fall END
BEGIN NOW Degraded, to what wretched state reserved! END
BEGIN NOW Better end here unborn. Why is life given END
BEGIN NOW To be thus wrested from us? rather, why END
BEGIN NOW Obtruded on us thus? who, if we knew END
BEGIN NOW What we receive, would either no accept END
BEGIN NOW Life offered, or soon beg to lay it down; END
BEGIN NOW Glad to be so dismissed in peace. Can thus END
BEGIN NOW The image of God in Man, created once END
BEGIN NOW So goodly and erect, though faulty since, END
BEGIN NOW To such unsightly sufferings be debased END
BEGIN NOW Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, END
BEGIN NOW Retaining still divine similitude END
BEGIN NOW In part, from such deformities be free, END
BEGIN NOW And, for his Maker's image sake, exempt? END
BEGIN NOW Their Maker's image, answered Michael, then END
BEGIN NOW Forsook them, when themselves they vilified END
BEGIN NOW To serve ungoverned Appetite; and took END
BEGIN NOW His image whom they served, a brutish vice, END
BEGIN NOW Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore so abject is their punishment, END
BEGIN NOW Disfiguring not God's likeness, but their own; END
BEGIN NOW Or if his likeness, by themselves defaced; END
BEGIN NOW While they pervert pure Nature's healthful rules END
BEGIN NOW To loathsome sickness; worthily, since they END
BEGIN NOW God's image did not reverence in themselves. END
BEGIN NOW I yield it just, said Adam, and submit. END
BEGIN NOW But is there yet no other way, besides END
BEGIN NOW These painful passages, how we may come END
BEGIN NOW To death, and mix with our connatural dust? END
BEGIN NOW There is, said Michael, if thou well observe END
BEGIN NOW The rule of Not too much; by temperance taught, END
BEGIN NOW In what thou eatest and drinkest; seeking from thence END
BEGIN NOW Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, END
BEGIN NOW Till many years over thy head return: END
BEGIN NOW So mayest thou live; till, like ripe fruit, thou drop END
BEGIN NOW Into thy mother's lap; or be with ease END
BEGIN NOW Gathered, nor harshly plucked; for death mature: END
BEGIN NOW This is Old Age; but then, thou must outlive END
BEGIN NOW Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty; which will change END
BEGIN NOW To withered, weak, and gray; thy senses then, END
BEGIN NOW Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forego, END
BEGIN NOW To what thou hast; and, for the air of youth, END
BEGIN NOW Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reign END
BEGIN NOW A melancholy damp of cold and dry END
BEGIN NOW To weigh thy spirits down, and last consume END
BEGIN NOW The balm of life. To whom our ancestor. END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth I fly not death, nor would prolong END
BEGIN NOW Life much; bent rather, how I may be quit, END
BEGIN NOW Fairest and easiest, of this cumbrous charge; END
BEGIN NOW Which I must keep till my appointed day END
BEGIN NOW Of rendering up, and patiently attend END
BEGIN NOW My dissolution. Michael replied. END
BEGIN NOW Nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou livest END
BEGIN NOW Live well; how long, or short, permit to Heaven: END
BEGIN NOW And now prepare thee for another sight. END
BEGIN NOW He looked, and saw a spacious plain, whereon END
BEGIN NOW Were tents of various hue; by some, were herds END
BEGIN NOW Of cattle grazing; others, whence the sound END
BEGIN NOW Of instruments, that made melodious chime, END
BEGIN NOW Was heard, of harp and organ; and, who moved END
BEGIN NOW Their stops and chords, was seen; his volant touch, END
BEGIN NOW Instinct through all proportions, low and high, END
BEGIN NOW Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue. END
BEGIN NOW In other part stood one who, at the forge END
BEGIN NOW Labouring, two massy clods of iron and brass END
BEGIN NOW Had melted, (whether found where casual fire END
BEGIN NOW Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale, END
BEGIN NOW Down to the veins of earth; thence gliding hot END
BEGIN NOW To some cave's mouth; or whether washed by stream END
BEGIN NOW From underground;) the liquid ore he drained END
BEGIN NOW Into fit moulds prepared; from which he formed END
BEGIN NOW First his own tools; then, what might else be wrought END
BEGIN NOW Fusil or graven in metal. After these, END
BEGIN NOW But on the hither side, a different sort END
BEGIN NOW From the high neighbouring hills, which was their seat, END
BEGIN NOW Down to the plain descended; by their guise END
BEGIN NOW Just men they seemed, and all their study bent END
BEGIN NOW To worship God aright, and know his works END
BEGIN NOW Not hid; nor those things last, which might preserve END
BEGIN NOW Freedom and peace to Men; they on the plain END
BEGIN NOW Long had not walked, when from the tents, behold! END
BEGIN NOW A bevy of fair women, richly gay END
BEGIN NOW In gems and wanton dress; to the harp they sung END
BEGIN NOW Soft amorous ditties, and in dance came on: END
BEGIN NOW The men, though grave, eyed them; and let their eyes END
BEGIN NOW Rove without rein; till, in the amorous net END
BEGIN NOW Fast caught, they liked; and each his liking chose; END
BEGIN NOW And now of love they treat, till the evening-star, END
BEGIN NOW Love's harbinger, appeared; then, all in heat END
BEGIN NOW They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke END
BEGIN NOW Hymen, then first to marriage rites invoked: END
BEGIN NOW With feast and musick all the tents resound. END
BEGIN NOW Such happy interview, and fair event END
BEGIN NOW Of love and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flowers, END
BEGIN NOW And charming symphonies, attached the heart END
BEGIN NOW Of Adam, soon inclined to admit delight, END
BEGIN NOW The bent of nature; which he thus expressed. END
BEGIN NOW True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest; END
BEGIN NOW Much better seems this vision, and more hope END
BEGIN NOW Of peaceful days portends, than those two past; END
BEGIN NOW Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse; END
BEGIN NOW Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Michael. Judge not what is best END
BEGIN NOW By pleasure, though to nature seeming meet; END
BEGIN NOW Created, as thou art, to nobler end END
BEGIN NOW Holy and pure, conformity divine. END
BEGIN NOW Those tents thou sawest so pleasant, were the tents END
BEGIN NOW Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his race END
BEGIN NOW Who slew his brother; studious they appear END
BEGIN NOW Of arts that polish life, inventers rare; END
BEGIN NOW Unmindful of their Maker, though his Spirit END
BEGIN NOW Taught them; but they his gifts acknowledged none. END
BEGIN NOW Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget; END
BEGIN NOW For that fair female troop thou sawest, that seemed END
BEGIN NOW Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, END
BEGIN NOW Yet empty of all good wherein consists END
BEGIN NOW Woman's domestick honour and chief praise; END
BEGIN NOW Bred only and completed to the taste END
BEGIN NOW Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance, END
BEGIN NOW To dress, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye: END
BEGIN NOW To these that sober race of men, whose lives END
BEGIN NOW Religious titled them the sons of God, END
BEGIN NOW Shall yield up all their virtue, all their fame END
BEGIN NOW Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles END
BEGIN NOW Of these fair atheists; and now swim in joy, END
BEGIN NOW Erelong to swim at large; and laugh, for which END
BEGIN NOW The world erelong a world of tears must weep. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Adam, of short joy bereft. END
BEGIN NOW O pity and shame, that they, who to live well END
BEGIN NOW Entered so fair, should turn aside to tread END
BEGIN NOW Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! END
BEGIN NOW But still I see the tenour of Man's woe END
BEGIN NOW Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. END
BEGIN NOW From Man's effeminate slackness it begins, END
BEGIN NOW Said the Angel, who should better hold his place END
BEGIN NOW By wisdom, and superiour gifts received. END
BEGIN NOW But now prepare thee for another scene. END
BEGIN NOW He looked, and saw wide territory spread END
BEGIN NOW Before him, towns, and rural works between; END
BEGIN NOW Cities of men with lofty gates and towers, END
BEGIN NOW Concourse in arms, fierce faces threatening war, END
BEGIN NOW Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise; END
BEGIN NOW Part wield their arms, part curb the foaming steed, END
BEGIN NOW Single or in array of battle ranged END
BEGIN NOW Both horse and foot, nor idly mustering stood; END
BEGIN NOW One way a band select from forage drives END
BEGIN NOW A herd of beeves, fair oxen and fair kine, END
BEGIN NOW From a fat meadow ground; or fleecy flock, END
BEGIN NOW Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain, END
BEGIN NOW Their booty; scarce with life the shepherds fly, END
BEGIN NOW But call in aid, which makes a bloody fray; END
BEGIN NOW With cruel tournament the squadrons join; END
BEGIN NOW Where cattle pastured late, now scattered lies END
BEGIN NOW With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field, END
BEGIN NOW Deserted: Others to a city strong END
BEGIN NOW Lay siege, encamped; by battery, scale, and mine, END
BEGIN NOW Assaulting; others from the wall defend END
BEGIN NOW With dart and javelin, stones, and sulphurous fire; END
BEGIN NOW On each hand slaughter, and gigantick deeds. END
BEGIN NOW In other part the sceptered heralds call END
BEGIN NOW To council, in the city-gates; anon END
BEGIN NOW Gray-headed men and grave, with warriours mixed, END
BEGIN NOW Assemble, and harangues are heard; but soon, END
BEGIN NOW In factious opposition; till at last, END
BEGIN NOW Of middle age one rising, eminent END
BEGIN NOW In wise deport, spake much of right and wrong, END
BEGIN NOW Of justice, or religion, truth, and peace, END
BEGIN NOW And judgement from above: him old and young END
BEGIN NOW Exploded, and had seized with violent hands, END
BEGIN NOW Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence END
BEGIN NOW Unseen amid the throng: so violence END
BEGIN NOW Proceeded, and oppression, and sword-law, END
BEGIN NOW Through all the plain, and refuge none was found. END
BEGIN NOW Adam was all in tears, and to his guide END
BEGIN NOW Lamenting turned full sad; O! what are these, END
BEGIN NOW Death's ministers, not men? who thus deal death END
BEGIN NOW Inhumanly to men, and multiply END
BEGIN NOW Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew END
BEGIN NOW His brother: for of whom such massacre END
BEGIN NOW Make they, but of their brethren; men of men END
BEGIN NOW But who was that just man, whom had not Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Rescued, had in his righteousness been lost? END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Michael. These are the product END
BEGIN NOW Of those ill-mated marriages thou sawest; END
BEGIN NOW Where good with bad were matched, who of themselves END
BEGIN NOW Abhor to join; and, by imprudence mixed, END
BEGIN NOW Produce prodigious births of body or mind. END
BEGIN NOW Such were these giants, men of high renown; END
BEGIN NOW For in those days might only shall be admired, END
BEGIN NOW And valour and heroick virtue called; END
BEGIN NOW To overcome in battle, and subdue END
BEGIN NOW Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite END
BEGIN NOW Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch END
BEGIN NOW Of human glory; and for glory done END
BEGIN NOW Of triumph, to be styled great conquerours END
BEGIN NOW Patrons of mankind, Gods, and sons of Gods; END
BEGIN NOW Destroyers rightlier called, and plagues of men. END
BEGIN NOW Thus fame shall be achieved, renown on earth; END
BEGIN NOW And what most merits fame, in silence hid. END
BEGIN NOW But he, the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst END
BEGIN NOW The only righteous in a world preverse, END
BEGIN NOW And therefore hated, therefore so beset END
BEGIN NOW With foes, for daring single to be just, END
BEGIN NOW And utter odious truth, that God would come END
BEGIN NOW To judge them with his Saints; him the Most High END
BEGIN NOW Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds END
BEGIN NOW Did, as thou sawest, receive, to walk with God END
BEGIN NOW High in salvation and the climes of bliss, END
BEGIN NOW Exempt from death; to show thee what reward END
BEGIN NOW Awaits the good; the rest what punishment; END
BEGIN NOW Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. END
BEGIN NOW He looked, and saw the face of things quite changed; END
BEGIN NOW The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar; END
BEGIN NOW All now was turned to jollity and game, END
BEGIN NOW To luxury and riot, feast and dance; END
BEGIN NOW Marrying or prostituting, as befel, END
BEGIN NOW Rape or adultery, where passing fair END
BEGIN NOW Allured them; thence from cups to civil broils. END
BEGIN NOW At length a reverend sire among them came, END
BEGIN NOW And of their doings great dislike declared, END
BEGIN NOW And testified against their ways; he oft END
BEGIN NOW Frequented their assemblies, whereso met, END
BEGIN NOW Triumphs or festivals; and to them preached END
BEGIN NOW Conversion and repentance, as to souls END
BEGIN NOW In prison, under judgements imminent: END
BEGIN NOW But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceased END
BEGIN NOW Contending, and removed his tents far off; END
BEGIN NOW Then, from the mountain hewing timber tall, END
BEGIN NOW Began to build a vessel of huge bulk; END
BEGIN NOW Measured by cubit, length, and breadth, and highth; END
BEGIN NOW Smeared round with pitch; and in the side a door END
BEGIN NOW Contrived; and of provisions laid in large, END
BEGIN NOW For man and beast: when lo, a wonder strange! END
BEGIN NOW Of every beast, and bird, and insect small, END
BEGIN NOW Came sevens, and pairs; and entered in as taught END
BEGIN NOW Their order: last the sire and his three sons, END
BEGIN NOW With their four wives; and God made fast the door. END
BEGIN NOW Mean while the south-wind rose, and, with black wings END
BEGIN NOW Wide-hovering, all the clouds together drove END
BEGIN NOW From under Heaven; the hills to their supply END
BEGIN NOW Vapour, and exhalation dusk and moist, END
BEGIN NOW Sent up amain; and now the thickened sky END
BEGIN NOW Like a dark ceiling stood; down rushed the rain END
BEGIN NOW Impetuous; and continued, till the earth END
BEGIN NOW No more was seen: the floating vessel swum END
BEGIN NOW Uplifted, and secure with beaked prow END
BEGIN NOW Rode tilting o'er the waves; all dwellings else END
BEGIN NOW Flood overwhelmed, and them with all their pomp END
BEGIN NOW Deep under water rolled; sea covered sea, END
BEGIN NOW Sea without shore; and in their palaces, END
BEGIN NOW Where luxury late reigned, sea-monsters whelped END
BEGIN NOW And stabled; of mankind, so numerous late, END
BEGIN NOW All left, in one small bottom swum imbarked. END
BEGIN NOW How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold END
BEGIN NOW The end of all thy offspring, end so sad, END
BEGIN NOW Depopulation! Thee another flood, END
BEGIN NOW Of tears and sorrow a flood, thee also drowned, END
BEGIN NOW And sunk thee as thy sons; till, gently reared END
BEGIN NOW By the Angel, on thy feet thou stoodest at last, END
BEGIN NOW Though comfortless; as when a father mourns END
BEGIN NOW His children, all in view destroyed at once; END
BEGIN NOW And scarce to the Angel utter'dst thus thy plaint. END
BEGIN NOW O visions ill foreseen! Better had I END
BEGIN NOW Lived ignorant of future! so had borne END
BEGIN NOW My part of evil only, each day's lot END
BEGIN NOW Enough to bear; those now, that were dispensed END
BEGIN NOW The burden of many ages, on me light END
BEGIN NOW At once, by my foreknowledge gaining birth END
BEGIN NOW Abortive, to torment me ere their being, END
BEGIN NOW With thought that they must be. Let no man seek END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth to be foretold, what shall befall END
BEGIN NOW Him or his children; evil he may be sure, END
BEGIN NOW Which neither his foreknowing can prevent; END
BEGIN NOW And he the future evil shall no less END
BEGIN NOW In apprehension than in substance feel, END
BEGIN NOW Grievous to bear: but that care now is past, END
BEGIN NOW Man is not whom to warn: those few escaped END
BEGIN NOW Famine and anguish will at last consume, END
BEGIN NOW Wandering that watery desart: I had hope, END
BEGIN NOW When violence was ceased, and war on earth, END
BEGIN NOW All would have then gone well; peace would have crowned END
BEGIN NOW With length of happy days the race of Man; END
BEGIN NOW But I was far deceived; for now I see END
BEGIN NOW Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste. END
BEGIN NOW How comes it thus? unfold, celestial Guide, END
BEGIN NOW And whether here the race of Man will end. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Michael. Those, whom last thou sawest END
BEGIN NOW In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they END
BEGIN NOW First seen in acts of prowess eminent END
BEGIN NOW And great exploits, but of true virtue void; END
BEGIN NOW Who, having spilt much blood, and done much wast END
BEGIN NOW Subduing nations, and achieved thereby END
BEGIN NOW Fame in the world, high titles, and rich prey; END
BEGIN NOW Shall change their course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, END
BEGIN NOW Surfeit, and lust; till wantonness and pride END
BEGIN NOW Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace. END
BEGIN NOW The conquered also, and enslaved by war, END
BEGIN NOW Shall, with their freedom lost, all virtue lose END
BEGIN NOW And fear of God; from whom their piety feigned END
BEGIN NOW In sharp contest of battle found no aid END
BEGIN NOW Against invaders; therefore, cooled in zeal, END
BEGIN NOW Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, END
BEGIN NOW Worldly or dissolute, on what their lords END
BEGIN NOW Shall leave them to enjoy; for the earth shall bear END
BEGIN NOW More than enough, that temperance may be tried: END
BEGIN NOW So all shall turn degenerate, all depraved; END
BEGIN NOW Justice and temperance, truth and faith, forgot; END
BEGIN NOW One man except, the only son of light END
BEGIN NOW In a dark age, against example good, END
BEGIN NOW Against allurement, custom, and a world END
BEGIN NOW Offended: fearless of reproach and scorn, END
BEGIN NOW Or violence, he of their wicked ways END
BEGIN NOW Shall them admonish; and before them set END
BEGIN NOW The paths of righteousness, how much more safe END
BEGIN NOW And full of peace; denouncing wrath to come END
BEGIN NOW On their impenitence; and shall return END
BEGIN NOW Of them derided, but of God observed END
BEGIN NOW The one just man alive; by his command END
BEGIN NOW Shall build a wonderous ark, as thou beheldst, END
BEGIN NOW To save himself, and houshold, from amidst END
BEGIN NOW A world devote to universal wrack. END
BEGIN NOW No sooner he, with them of man and beast END
BEGIN NOW Select for life, shall in the ark be lodged, END
BEGIN NOW And sheltered round; but all the cataracts END
BEGIN NOW Of Heaven set open on the Earth shall pour END
BEGIN NOW Rain, day and night; all fountains of the deep, END
BEGIN NOW Broke up, shall heave the ocean to usurp END
BEGIN NOW Beyond all bounds; till inundation rise END
BEGIN NOW Above the highest hills: Then shall this mount END
BEGIN NOW Of Paradise by might of waves be moved END
BEGIN NOW Out of his place, pushed by the horned flood, END
BEGIN NOW With all his verdure spoiled, and trees adrift, END
BEGIN NOW Down the great river to the opening gulf, END
BEGIN NOW And there take root an island salt and bare, END
BEGIN NOW The haunt of seals, and orcs, and sea-mews' clang: END
BEGIN NOW To teach thee that God attributes to place END
BEGIN NOW No sanctity, if none be thither brought END
BEGIN NOW By men who there frequent, or therein dwell. END
BEGIN NOW And now, what further shall ensue, behold. END
BEGIN NOW He looked, and saw the ark hull on the flood, END
BEGIN NOW Which now abated; for the clouds were fled, END
BEGIN NOW Driven by a keen north-wind, that, blowing dry, END
BEGIN NOW Wrinkled the face of deluge, as decayed; END
BEGIN NOW And the clear sun on his wide watery glass END
BEGIN NOW Gazed hot, and of the fresh wave largely drew, END
BEGIN NOW As after thirst; which made their flowing shrink END
BEGIN NOW From standing lake to tripping ebb, that stole END
BEGIN NOW With soft foot towards the deep; who now had stopt END
BEGIN NOW His sluces, as the Heaven his windows shut. END
BEGIN NOW The ark no more now floats, but seems on ground, END
BEGIN NOW Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed. END
BEGIN NOW And now the tops of hills, as rocks, appear; END
BEGIN NOW With clamour thence the rapid currents drive, END
BEGIN NOW Towards the retreating sea, their furious tide. END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith from out the ark a raven flies, END
BEGIN NOW And after him, the surer messenger, END
BEGIN NOW A dove sent forth once and again to spy END
BEGIN NOW Green tree or ground, whereon his foot may light: END
BEGIN NOW The second time returning, in his bill END
BEGIN NOW An olive-leaf he brings, pacifick sign: END
BEGIN NOW Anon dry ground appears, and from his ark END
BEGIN NOW The ancient sire descends, with all his train; END
BEGIN NOW Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, END
BEGIN NOW Grateful to Heaven, over his head beholds END
BEGIN NOW A dewy cloud, and in the cloud a bow END
BEGIN NOW Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay, END
BEGIN NOW Betokening peace from God, and covenant new. END
BEGIN NOW Whereat the heart of Adam, erst so sad, END
BEGIN NOW Greatly rejoiced; and thus his joy broke forth. END
BEGIN NOW O thou, who future things canst represent END
BEGIN NOW As present, heavenly Instructer! I revive END
BEGIN NOW At this last sight; assured that Man shall live, END
BEGIN NOW With all the creatures, and their seed preserve. END
BEGIN NOW Far less I now lament for one whole world END
BEGIN NOW Of wicked sons destroyed, than I rejoice END
BEGIN NOW For one man found so perfect, and so just, END
BEGIN NOW That God vouchsafes to raise another world END
BEGIN NOW From him, and all his anger to forget. END
BEGIN NOW But say, what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Distended, as the brow of God appeased? END
BEGIN NOW Or serve they, as a flowery verge, to bind END
BEGIN NOW The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud, END
BEGIN NOW Lest it again dissolve, and shower the earth? END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Arch-Angel. Dextrously thou aimest; END
BEGIN NOW So willingly doth God remit his ire, END
BEGIN NOW Though late repenting him of Man depraved; END
BEGIN NOW Grieved at his heart, when looking down he saw END
BEGIN NOW The whole earth filled with violence, and all flesh END
BEGIN NOW Corrupting each their way; yet, those removed, END
BEGIN NOW Such grace shall one just man find in his sight, END
BEGIN NOW That he relents, not to blot out mankind; END
BEGIN NOW And makes a covenant never to destroy END
BEGIN NOW The earth again by flood; nor let the sea END
BEGIN NOW Surpass his bounds; nor rain to drown the world, END
BEGIN NOW With man therein or beast; but, when he brings END
BEGIN NOW Over the earth a cloud, will therein set END
BEGIN NOW His triple-coloured bow, whereon to look, END
BEGIN NOW And call to mind his covenant: Day and night, END
BEGIN NOW Seed-time and harvest, heat and hoary frost, END
BEGIN NOW Shall hold their course; till fire purge all things new, END
BEGIN NOW Both Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell. END
BEGIN NOW As one who in his journey bates at noon, END
BEGIN NOW Though bent on speed; so here the Arch-Angel paused END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored, END
BEGIN NOW If Adam aught perhaps might interpose; END
BEGIN NOW Then, with transition sweet, new speech resumes. END
BEGIN NOW Thus thou hast seen one world begin, and end; END
BEGIN NOW And Man, as from a second stock, proceed. END
BEGIN NOW Much thou hast yet to see; but I perceive END
BEGIN NOW Thy mortal sight to fail; objects divine END
BEGIN NOW Must needs impair and weary human sense: END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth what is to come I will relate; END
BEGIN NOW Thou therefore give due audience, and attend. END
BEGIN NOW This second source of Men, while yet but few, END
BEGIN NOW And while the dread of judgement past remains END
BEGIN NOW Fresh in their minds, fearing the Deity, END
BEGIN NOW With some regard to what is just and right END
BEGIN NOW Shall lead their lives, and multiply apace; END
BEGIN NOW Labouring the soil, and reaping plenteous crop, END
BEGIN NOW Corn, wine, and oil; and, from the herd or flock, END
BEGIN NOW Oft sacrificing bullock, lamb, or kid, END
BEGIN NOW With large wine-offerings poured, and sacred feast, END
BEGIN NOW Shall spend their days in joy unblamed; and dwell END
BEGIN NOW Long time in peace, by families and tribes, END
BEGIN NOW Under paternal rule: till one shall rise END
BEGIN NOW Of proud ambitious heart; who, not content END
BEGIN NOW With fair equality, fraternal state, END
BEGIN NOW Will arrogate dominion undeserved END
BEGIN NOW Over his brethren, and quite dispossess END
BEGIN NOW Concord and law of nature from the earth; END
BEGIN NOW Hunting (and men not beasts shall be his game) END
BEGIN NOW With war, and hostile snare, such as refuse END
BEGIN NOW Subjection to his empire tyrannous: END
BEGIN NOW A mighty hunter thence he shall be styled END
BEGIN NOW Before the Lord; as in despite of Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Or from Heaven, claiming second sovranty; END
BEGIN NOW And from rebellion shall derive his name, END
BEGIN NOW Though of rebellion others he accuse. END
BEGIN NOW He with a crew, whom like ambition joins END
BEGIN NOW With him or under him to tyrannize, END
BEGIN NOW Marching from Eden towards the west, shall find END
BEGIN NOW The plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge END
BEGIN NOW Boils out from under ground, the mouth of Hell: END
BEGIN NOW Of brick, and of that stuff, they cast to build END
BEGIN NOW A city and tower, whose top may reach to Heaven; END
BEGIN NOW And get themselves a name; lest, far dispersed END
BEGIN NOW In foreign lands, their memory be lost; END
BEGIN NOW Regardless whether good or evil fame. END
BEGIN NOW But God, who oft descends to visit men END
BEGIN NOW Unseen, and through their habitations walks END
BEGIN NOW To mark their doings, them beholding soon, END
BEGIN NOW Comes down to see their city, ere the tower END
BEGIN NOW Obstruct Heaven-towers, and in derision sets END
BEGIN NOW Upon their tongues a various spirit, to rase END
BEGIN NOW Quite out their native language; and, instead, END
BEGIN NOW To sow a jangling noise of words unknown: END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud, END
BEGIN NOW Among the builders; each to other calls END
BEGIN NOW Not understood; till hoarse, and all in rage, END
BEGIN NOW As mocked they storm: great laughter was in Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW And looking down, to see the hubbub strange, END
BEGIN NOW And hear the din: Thus was the building left END
BEGIN NOW Ridiculous, and the work Confusion named. END
BEGIN NOW Whereto thus Adam, fatherly displeased. END
BEGIN NOW O execrable son! so to aspire END
BEGIN NOW Above his brethren; to himself assuming END
BEGIN NOW Authority usurped, from God not given: END
BEGIN NOW He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl, END
BEGIN NOW Dominion absolute; that right we hold END
BEGIN NOW By his donation; but man over men END
BEGIN NOW He made not lord; such title to himself END
BEGIN NOW Reserving, human left from human free. END
BEGIN NOW But this usurper his encroachment proud END
BEGIN NOW Stays not on Man; to God his tower intends END
BEGIN NOW Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food END
BEGIN NOW Will he convey up thither, to sustain END
BEGIN NOW Himself and his rash army; where thin air END
BEGIN NOW Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross, END
BEGIN NOW And famish him of breath, if not of bread? END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Michael. Justly thou abhorrest END
BEGIN NOW That son, who on the quiet state of men END
BEGIN NOW Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue END
BEGIN NOW Rational liberty; yet know withal, END
BEGIN NOW Since thy original lapse, true liberty END
BEGIN NOW Is lost, which always with right reason dwells END
BEGIN NOW Twinned, and from her hath no dividual being: END
BEGIN NOW Reason in man obscured, or not obeyed, END
BEGIN NOW Immediately inordinate desires, END
BEGIN NOW And upstart passions, catch the government END
BEGIN NOW From reason; and to servitude reduce END
BEGIN NOW Man, till then free. Therefore, since he permits END
BEGIN NOW Within himself unworthy powers to reign END
BEGIN NOW Over free reason, God, in judgement just, END
BEGIN NOW Subjects him from without to violent lords; END
BEGIN NOW Who oft as undeservedly enthrall END
BEGIN NOW His outward freedom: Tyranny must be; END
BEGIN NOW Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse. END
BEGIN NOW Yet sometimes nations will decline so low END
BEGIN NOW From virtue, which is reason, that no wrong, END
BEGIN NOW But justice, and some fatal curse annexed, END
BEGIN NOW Deprives them of their outward liberty; END
BEGIN NOW Their inward lost: Witness the irreverent son END
BEGIN NOW Of him who built the ark; who, for the shame END
BEGIN NOW Done to his father, heard this heavy curse, END
BEGIN NOW Servant of servants, on his vicious race. END
BEGIN NOW Thus will this latter, as the former world, END
BEGIN NOW Still tend from bad to worse; till God at last, END
BEGIN NOW Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw END
BEGIN NOW His presence from among them, and avert END
BEGIN NOW His holy eyes; resolving from thenceforth END
BEGIN NOW To leave them to their own polluted ways; END
BEGIN NOW And one peculiar nation to select END
BEGIN NOW From all the rest, of whom to be invoked, END
BEGIN NOW A nation from one faithful man to spring: END
BEGIN NOW Him on this side Euphrates yet residing, END
BEGIN NOW Bred up in idol-worship: O, that men END
BEGIN NOW (Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown, END
BEGIN NOW While yet the patriarch lived, who 'scaped the flood, END
BEGIN NOW As to forsake the living God, and fall END
BEGIN NOW To worship their own work in wood and stone END
BEGIN NOW For Gods! Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes END
BEGIN NOW To call by vision, from his father's house, END
BEGIN NOW His kindred, and false Gods, into a land END
BEGIN NOW Which he will show him; and from him will raise END
BEGIN NOW A mighty nation; and upon him shower END
BEGIN NOW His benediction so, that in his seed END
BEGIN NOW All nations shall be blest: he straight obeys; END
BEGIN NOW Not knowing to what land, yet firm believes: END
BEGIN NOW I see him, but thou canst not, with what faith END
BEGIN NOW He leaves his Gods, his friends, and native soil, END
BEGIN NOW Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the ford END
BEGIN NOW To Haran; after him a cumbrous train END
BEGIN NOW Of herds and flocks, and numerous servitude; END
BEGIN NOW Not wandering poor, but trusting all his wealth END
BEGIN NOW With God, who called him, in a land unknown. END
BEGIN NOW Canaan he now attains; I see his tents END
BEGIN NOW Pitched about Sechem, and the neighbouring plain END
BEGIN NOW Of Moreh; there by promise he receives END
BEGIN NOW Gift to his progeny of all that land, END
BEGIN NOW From Hameth northward to the Desart south; END
BEGIN NOW (Things by their names I call, though yet unnamed;) END
BEGIN NOW From Hermon east to the great western Sea; END
BEGIN NOW Mount Hermon, yonder sea; each place behold END
BEGIN NOW In prospect, as I point them; on the shore END
BEGIN NOW Mount Carmel; here, the double-founted stream, END
BEGIN NOW Jordan, true limit eastward; but his sons END
BEGIN NOW Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of hills. END
BEGIN NOW This ponder, that all nations of the earth END
BEGIN NOW Shall in his seed be blessed: By that seed END
BEGIN NOW Is meant thy great Deliverer, who shall bruise END
BEGIN NOW The Serpent's head; whereof to thee anon END
BEGIN NOW Plainlier shall be revealed. This patriarch blest, END
BEGIN NOW Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call, END
BEGIN NOW A son, and of his son a grand-child, leaves; END
BEGIN NOW Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown: END
BEGIN NOW The grandchild, with twelve sons increased, departs END
BEGIN NOW From Canaan to a land hereafter called END
BEGIN NOW See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths END
BEGIN NOW Into the sea. To sojourn in that land END
BEGIN NOW He comes, invited by a younger son END
BEGIN NOW In time of dearth, a son whose worthy deeds END
BEGIN NOW Raise him to be the second in that realm END
BEGIN NOW Of Pharaoh. There he dies, and leaves his race END
BEGIN NOW Growing into a nation, and now grown END
BEGIN NOW Suspected to a sequent king, who seeks END
BEGIN NOW To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests END
BEGIN NOW Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves END
BEGIN NOW Inhospitably, and kills their infant males: END
BEGIN NOW Till by two brethren (these two brethren call END
BEGIN NOW Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claim END
BEGIN NOW His people from enthralment, they return, END
BEGIN NOW With glory and spoil, back to their promised land. END
BEGIN NOW But first, the lawless tyrant, who denies END
BEGIN NOW To know their God, or message to regard, END
BEGIN NOW Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire; END
BEGIN NOW To blood unshed the rivers must be turned; END
BEGIN NOW Frogs, lice, and flies, must all his palace fill END
BEGIN NOW With loathed intrusion, and fill all the land; END
BEGIN NOW His cattle must of rot and murren die; END
BEGIN NOW Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss, END
BEGIN NOW And all his people; thunder mixed with hail, END
BEGIN NOW And wheel on the earth, devouring where it rolls; END
BEGIN NOW What it devours not, herb, or fruit, or grain, END
BEGIN NOW A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down END
BEGIN NOW Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green; END
BEGIN NOW Darkness must overshadow all his bounds, END
BEGIN NOW Palpable darkness, and blot out three days; END
BEGIN NOW Last, with one midnight stroke, all the first-born END
BEGIN NOW The river-dragon tamed at length submits END
BEGIN NOW To let his sojourners depart, and oft END
BEGIN NOW Humbles his stubborn heart; but still, as ice END
BEGIN NOW More hardened after thaw; till, in his rage END
BEGIN NOW Pursuing whom he late dismissed, the sea END
BEGIN NOW Swallows him with his host; but them lets pass, END
BEGIN NOW As on dry land, between two crystal walls; END
BEGIN NOW Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand END
BEGIN NOW Divided, till his rescued gain their shore: END
BEGIN NOW Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend, END
BEGIN NOW Though present in his Angel; who shall go END
BEGIN NOW Before them in a cloud, and pillar of fire; END
BEGIN NOW By day a cloud, by night a pillar of fire; END
BEGIN NOW To guide them in their journey, and remove END
BEGIN NOW Behind them, while the obdurate king pursues: END
BEGIN NOW All night he will pursue; but his approach END
BEGIN NOW Darkness defends between till morning watch; END
BEGIN NOW Then through the fiery pillar, and the cloud, END
BEGIN NOW God looking forth will trouble all his host, END
BEGIN NOW And craze their chariot-wheels: when by command END
BEGIN NOW Moses once more his potent rod extends END
BEGIN NOW Over the sea; the sea his rod obeys; END
BEGIN NOW On their embattled ranks the waves return, END
BEGIN NOW And overwhelm their war: The race elect END
BEGIN NOW Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance END
BEGIN NOW Through the wild Desart, not the readiest way; END
BEGIN NOW Lest, entering on the Canaanite alarmed, END
BEGIN NOW War terrify them inexpert, and fear END
BEGIN NOW Inglorious life with servitude; for life END
BEGIN NOW To noble and ignoble is more sweet END
BEGIN NOW Untrained in arms, where rashness leads not on. END
BEGIN NOW This also shall they gain by their delay END
BEGIN NOW In the wide wilderness; there they shall found END
BEGIN NOW Their government, and their great senate choose END
BEGIN NOW Through the twelve tribes, to rule by laws ordained: END
BEGIN NOW God from the mount of Sinai, whose gray top END
BEGIN NOW Shall tremble, he descending, will himself END
BEGIN NOW In thunder, lightning, and loud trumpets' sound, END
BEGIN NOW Ordain them laws; part, such as appertain END
BEGIN NOW To civil justice; part, religious rites END
BEGIN NOW Of sacrifice; informing them, by types END
BEGIN NOW And shadows, of that destined Seed to bruise END
BEGIN NOW The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve END
BEGIN NOW Mankind's deliverance. But the voice of God END
BEGIN NOW To mortal ear is dreadful: They beseech END
BEGIN NOW That Moses might report to them his will, END
BEGIN NOW And terrour cease; he grants what they besought, END
BEGIN NOW Instructed that to God is no access END
BEGIN NOW Without Mediator, whose high office now END
BEGIN NOW Moses in figure bears; to introduce END
BEGIN NOW One greater, of whose day he shall foretel, END
BEGIN NOW And all the Prophets in their age the times END
BEGIN NOW Of great Messiah shall sing. Thus, laws and rites END
BEGIN NOW Established, such delight hath God in Men END
BEGIN NOW Obedient to his will, that he vouchsafes END
BEGIN NOW Among them to set up his tabernacle; END
BEGIN NOW The Holy One with mortal Men to dwell: END
BEGIN NOW By his prescript a sanctuary is framed END
BEGIN NOW Of cedar, overlaid with gold; therein END
BEGIN NOW An ark, and in the ark his testimony, END
BEGIN NOW The records of his covenant; over these END
BEGIN NOW A mercy-seat of gold, between the wings END
BEGIN NOW Of two bright Cherubim; before him burn END
BEGIN NOW Seven lamps as in a zodiack representing END
BEGIN NOW The heavenly fires; over the tent a cloud END
BEGIN NOW Shall rest by day, a fiery gleam by night; END
BEGIN NOW Save when they journey, and at length they come, END
BEGIN NOW Conducted by his Angel, to the land END
BEGIN NOW Promised to Abraham and his seed:--The rest END
BEGIN NOW Were long to tell; how many battles fought END
BEGIN NOW How many kings destroyed; and kingdoms won; END
BEGIN NOW Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still END
BEGIN NOW A day entire, and night's due course adjourn, END
BEGIN NOW Man's voice commanding, "Sun, in Gibeon stand, END
BEGIN NOW And thou moon in the vale of Aialon, END
BEGIN NOW Till Israel overcome!" so call the third END
BEGIN NOW From Abraham, son of Isaac; and from him END
BEGIN NOW His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win. END
BEGIN NOW Here Adam interposed. O sent from Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Enlightener of my darkness, gracious things END
BEGIN NOW Thou hast revealed; those chiefly, which concern END
BEGIN NOW Just Abraham and his seed: now first I find END
BEGIN NOW Mine eyes true-opening, and my heart much eased; END
BEGIN NOW Erewhile perplexed with thoughts, what would become END
BEGIN NOW Of me and all mankind: But now I see END
BEGIN NOW His day, in whom all nations shall be blest; END
BEGIN NOW Favour unmerited by me, who sought END
BEGIN NOW Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means. END
BEGIN NOW This yet I apprehend not, why to those END
BEGIN NOW Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth END
BEGIN NOW So many and so various laws are given; END
BEGIN NOW So many laws argue so many sins END
BEGIN NOW Among them; how can God with such reside? END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sin END
BEGIN NOW Will reign among them, as of thee begot; END
BEGIN NOW And therefore was law given them, to evince END
BEGIN NOW Their natural pravity, by stirring up END
BEGIN NOW Sin against law to fight: that when they see END
BEGIN NOW Law can discover sin, but not remove, END
BEGIN NOW Save by those shadowy expiations weak, END
BEGIN NOW The blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude END
BEGIN NOW Some blood more precious must be paid for Man; END
BEGIN NOW Just for unjust; that, in such righteousness END
BEGIN NOW To them by faith imputed, they may find END
BEGIN NOW Justification towards God, and peace END
BEGIN NOW Of conscience; which the law by ceremonies END
BEGIN NOW Cannot appease; nor Man the mortal part END
BEGIN NOW Perform; and, not performing, cannot live. END
BEGIN NOW So law appears imperfect; and but given END
BEGIN NOW With purpose to resign them, in full time, END
BEGIN NOW Up to a better covenant; disciplined END
BEGIN NOW From shadowy types to truth; from flesh to spirit; END
BEGIN NOW From imposition of strict laws to free END
BEGIN NOW Acceptance of large grace; from servile fear END
BEGIN NOW To filial; works of law to works of faith. END
BEGIN NOW And therefore shall not Moses, though of God END
BEGIN NOW Highly beloved, being but the minister END
BEGIN NOW Of law, his people into Canaan lead; END
BEGIN NOW But Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call, END
BEGIN NOW His name and office bearing, who shall quell END
BEGIN NOW The adversary-Serpent, and bring back END
BEGIN NOW Through the world's wilderness long-wandered Man END
BEGIN NOW Safe to eternal Paradise of rest. END
BEGIN NOW Mean while they, in their earthly Canaan placed, END
BEGIN NOW Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins END

BEGIN NOW To teach all nations what of him they learned END

BEGIN NOW Baptizing in the profluent stream, the sign END

BEGIN NOW Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall, END
BEGIN NOW For death, like that which the Redeemer died. END

BEGIN NOW Through all his realm, and there confounded leave; END
BEGIN NOW Then enter into glory, and resume END
BEGIN NOW His seat at God's right hand, exalted high END

BEGIN NOW When this world's dissolution shall be ripe, END
BEGIN NOW With glory and power to judge both quick and dead; END
BEGIN NOW To judge the unfaithful dead, but to reward END
BEGIN NOW His faithful, and receive them into bliss, END
BEGIN NOW Whether in Heaven or Earth; for then the Earth END
BEGIN NOW Shall all be Paradise, far happier place END
BEGIN NOW Than this of Eden, and far happier days. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Arch-Angel Michael; then paused, END
BEGIN NOW As at the world's great period; and our sire, END
BEGIN NOW Replete with joy and wonder, thus replied. END
BEGIN NOW O Goodness infinite, Goodness immense! END
BEGIN NOW That all this good of evil shall produce, END
BEGIN NOW And evil turn to good; more wonderful END
BEGIN NOW Than that which by creation first brought forth END
BEGIN NOW Light out of darkness! Full of doubt I stand, END
BEGIN NOW Whether I should repent me now of sin END
BEGIN NOW By me done, and occasioned; or rejoice END
BEGIN NOW Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring; END
BEGIN NOW To God more glory, more good-will to Men END
BEGIN NOW From God, and over wrath grace shall abound. END
BEGIN NOW But say, if our Deliverer up to Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Must re-ascend, what will betide the few END
BEGIN NOW His faithful, left among the unfaithful herd, END
BEGIN NOW The enemies of truth? Who then shall guide END
BEGIN NOW His people, who defend? Will they not deal END
BEGIN NOW Worse with his followers than with him they dealt? END
BEGIN NOW Be sure they will, said the Angel; but from Heaven END
BEGIN NOW He to his own a Comforter will send, END
BEGIN NOW The promise of the Father, who shall dwell END
BEGIN NOW His Spirit within them; and the law of faith, END
BEGIN NOW Working through love, upon their hearts shall write, END
BEGIN NOW To guide them in all truth; and also arm END
BEGIN NOW With spiritual armour, able to resist END
BEGIN NOW Satan's assaults, and quench his fiery darts; END
BEGIN NOW What man can do against them, not afraid, END
BEGIN NOW Though to the death; against such cruelties END
BEGIN NOW With inward consolations recompensed, END
BEGIN NOW And oft supported so as shall amaze END
BEGIN NOW Their proudest persecutors: For the Spirit, END
BEGIN NOW Poured first on his Apostles, whom he sends END
BEGIN NOW To evangelize the nations, then on all END
BEGIN NOW Baptized, shall them with wonderous gifts endue END
BEGIN NOW To speak all tongues, and do all miracles, END
BEGIN NOW As did their Lord before them. Thus they win END
BEGIN NOW Great numbers of each nation to receive END
BEGIN NOW With joy the tidings brought from Heaven: At length END
BEGIN NOW Their ministry performed, and race well run, END
BEGIN NOW Their doctrine and their story written left, END
BEGIN NOW They die; but in their room, as they forewarn, END
BEGIN NOW Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves, END
BEGIN NOW Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW To their own vile advantages shall turn END
BEGIN NOW Of lucre and ambition; and the truth END
BEGIN NOW With superstitions and traditions taint, END
BEGIN NOW Left only in those written records pure, END
BEGIN NOW Though not but by the Spirit understood. END
BEGIN NOW Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names, END
BEGIN NOW Places, and titles, and with these to join END
BEGIN NOW Secular power; though feigning still to act END
BEGIN NOW By spiritual, to themselves appropriating END
BEGIN NOW The Spirit of God, promised alike and given END
BEGIN NOW To all believers; and, from that pretence, END
BEGIN NOW Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force END
BEGIN NOW On every conscience; laws which none shall find END
BEGIN NOW Left them inrolled, or what the Spirit within END
BEGIN NOW Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then END
BEGIN NOW But force the Spirit of Grace itself, and bind END
BEGIN NOW His consort Liberty? what, but unbuild END
BEGIN NOW His living temples, built by faith to stand, END
BEGIN NOW Their own faith, not another's? for, on earth, END
BEGIN NOW Who against faith and conscience can be heard END
BEGIN NOW Infallible? yet many will presume: END
BEGIN NOW Whence heavy persecution shall arise END
BEGIN NOW On all, who in the worship persevere END
BEGIN NOW Of spirit and truth; the rest, far greater part, END
BEGIN NOW Will deem in outward rites and specious forms END
BEGIN NOW Religion satisfied; Truth shall retire END
BEGIN NOW Bestuck with slanderous darts, and works of faith END
BEGIN NOW Rarely be found: So shall the world go on, END
BEGIN NOW To good malignant, to bad men benign; END
BEGIN NOW Under her own weight groaning; till the day END
BEGIN NOW Appear of respiration to the just, END
BEGIN NOW And vengeance to the wicked, at return END
BEGIN NOW Of him so lately promised to thy aid, END
BEGIN NOW The Woman's Seed; obscurely then foretold, END
BEGIN NOW Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord; END
BEGIN NOW Last, in the clouds, from Heaven to be revealed END
BEGIN NOW In glory of the Father, to dissolve END
BEGIN NOW Satan with his perverted world; then raise END
BEGIN NOW From the conflagrant mass, purged and refined, END
BEGIN NOW New Heavens, new Earth, ages of endless date, END
BEGIN NOW Founded in righteousness, and peace, and love; END
BEGIN NOW To bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss. END
BEGIN NOW He ended; and thus Adam last replied. END
BEGIN NOW How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest, END
BEGIN NOW Measured this transient world, the race of time, END
BEGIN NOW Till time stand fixed! Beyond is all abyss, END
BEGIN NOW Eternity, whose end no eye can reach. END
BEGIN NOW Greatly-instructed I shall hence depart; END
BEGIN NOW Greatly in peace of thought; and have my fill END
BEGIN NOW Of knowledge, what this vessel can contain; END
BEGIN NOW Beyond which was my folly to aspire. END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth I learn, that to obey is best, END
BEGIN NOW And love with fear the only God; to walk END
BEGIN NOW As in his presence; ever to observe END
BEGIN NOW His providence; and on him sole depend, END
BEGIN NOW Merciful over all his works, with good END
BEGIN NOW Still overcoming evil, and by small END
BEGIN NOW Accomplishing great things, by things deemed weak END
BEGIN NOW Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise END
BEGIN NOW By simply meek: that suffering for truth's sake END
BEGIN NOW Is fortitude to highest victory, END
BEGIN NOW And, to the faithful, death the gate of life; END
BEGIN NOW Taught this by his example, whom I now END
BEGIN NOW Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus also the Angel last replied. END
BEGIN NOW This having learned, thou hast attained the sum END
BEGIN NOW Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the stars END
BEGIN NOW Thou knewest by name, and all the ethereal powers, END
BEGIN NOW All secrets of the deep, all Nature's works, END
BEGIN NOW Or works of God in Heaven, air, earth, or sea, END
BEGIN NOW And all the riches of this world enjoyedst, END
BEGIN NOW And all the rule, one empire; only add END
BEGIN NOW Deeds to thy knowledge answerable; add faith, END
BEGIN NOW Add virtue, patience, temperance; add love, END
BEGIN NOW By name to come called charity, the soul END
BEGIN NOW Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loth END
BEGIN NOW To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess END
BEGIN NOW A Paradise within thee, happier far.-- END
BEGIN NOW Let us descend now therefore from this top END
BEGIN NOW Of speculation; for the hour precise END
BEGIN NOW Exacts our parting hence; and see the guards, END
BEGIN NOW By me encamped on yonder hill, expect END
BEGIN NOW Their motion; at whose front a flaming sword, END
BEGIN NOW In signal of remove, waves fiercely round: END
BEGIN NOW We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; END
BEGIN NOW Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed END
BEGIN NOW Portending good, and all her spirits composed END
BEGIN NOW To meek submission: thou, at season fit, END
BEGIN NOW Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard; END
BEGIN NOW Chiefly what may concern her faith to know, END
BEGIN NOW The great deliverance by her seed to come END
BEGIN NOW (For by the Woman's seed) on all mankind: END
BEGIN NOW That ye may live, which will be many days, END
BEGIN NOW Both in one faith unanimous, though sad, END
BEGIN NOW With cause, for evils past; yet much more cheered END
BEGIN NOW With meditation on the happy end. END
BEGIN NOW He ended, and they both descend the hill; END
BEGIN NOW Descended, Adam to the bower, where Eve END
BEGIN NOW Lay sleeping, ran before; but found her waked; END
BEGIN NOW And thus with words not sad she him received. END
BEGIN NOW Whence thou returnest, and whither wentest, I know; END
BEGIN NOW For God is also in sleep; and dreams advise, END
BEGIN NOW Which he hath sent propitious, some great good END
BEGIN NOW Presaging, since with sorrow and heart's distress END
BEGIN NOW Wearied I fell asleep: But now lead on; END
BEGIN NOW In me is no delay; with thee to go, END
BEGIN NOW Is to stay here; without thee here to stay, END
BEGIN NOW Is to go hence unwilling; thou to me END
BEGIN NOW Art all things under Heaven, all places thou, END
BEGIN NOW Who for my wilful crime art banished hence. END
BEGIN NOW This further consolation yet secure END
BEGIN NOW I carry hence; though all by me is lost, END
BEGIN NOW Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed, END
BEGIN NOW By me the Promised Seed shall all restore. END
BEGIN NOW So spake our mother Eve; and Adam heard END
BEGIN NOW Well pleased, but answered not: For now, too nigh END
BEGIN NOW The Arch-Angel stood; and, from the other hill END
BEGIN NOW To their fixed station, all in bright array END
BEGIN NOW The Cherubim descended; on the ground END
BEGIN NOW Gliding meteorous, as evening-mist END
BEGIN NOW Risen from a river o'er the marish glides, END
BEGIN NOW And gathers ground fast at the labourer's heel END
BEGIN NOW Homeward returning. High in front advanced, END
BEGIN NOW The brandished sword of God before them blazed, END
BEGIN NOW Fierce as a comet; which with torrid heat, END
BEGIN NOW And vapour as the Libyan air adust, END
BEGIN NOW Began to parch that temperate clime; whereat END
BEGIN NOW In either hand the hastening Angel caught END
BEGIN NOW Our lingering parents, and to the eastern gate END
BEGIN NOW Led them direct, and down the cliff as fast END
BEGIN NOW To the subjected plain; then disappeared. END
BEGIN NOW They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld END
BEGIN NOW Of Paradise, so late their happy seat, END
BEGIN NOW Waved over by that flaming brand; the gate END
BEGIN NOW With dreadful faces thronged, and fiery arms: END
BEGIN NOW Some natural tears they dropt, but wiped them soon; END
BEGIN NOW The world was all before them, where to choose END
BEGIN NOW Their place of rest, and Providence their guide: END
BEGIN NOW They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow, END
BEGIN NOW Through Eden took their solitary way. END
BEGIN NOW I, WHO erewhile the happy Garden sung END
BEGIN NOW By one man's disobedience lost, now sing END
BEGIN NOW Recovered Paradise to all mankind, END
BEGIN NOW By one man's firm obedience fully tried END
BEGIN NOW Through all temptation, and the Tempter foiled END
BEGIN NOW In all his wiles, defeated and repulsed, END
BEGIN NOW And Eden raised in the waste Wilderness. END
BEGIN NOW Thou Spirit, who led'st this glorious Eremite END
BEGIN NOW Into the desert, his victorious field END
BEGIN NOW Against the spiritual foe, and brought'st him thence END
BEGIN NOW By proof the undoubted Son of God, inspire, END
BEGIN NOW As thou art wont, my prompted song, else mute, END
BEGIN NOW And bear through highth or depth of Nature's bounds, END
BEGIN NOW With prosperous wing full summed, to tell of deeds END
BEGIN NOW Above heroic, though in secret done, END
BEGIN NOW And unrecorded left through many an age: END
BEGIN NOW Worthy to have not remained so long unsung. END
BEGIN NOW Now had the great Proclaimer, with a voice END
BEGIN NOW More awful than the sound of trumpet, cried END
BEGIN NOW Repentance, and Heaven's kingdom nigh at hand END
BEGIN NOW To all baptized. To his great baptism flocked END
BEGIN NOW With awe the regions round, and with them came END
BEGIN NOW From Nazareth the son of Joseph deemed END
BEGIN NOW To the flood Jordan--came as then obscure, END
BEGIN NOW Unmarked, unknown. But him the Baptist soon END
BEGIN NOW Descried, divinely warned, and witness bore END
BEGIN NOW As to his worthier, and would have resigned END
BEGIN NOW To him his heavenly office. Nor was long END
BEGIN NOW His witness unconfirmed: on him baptized END
BEGIN NOW Heaven opened, and in likeness of a Dove END
BEGIN NOW The Spirit descended, while the Father's voice END
BEGIN NOW From Heaven pronounced him his beloved Son. END
BEGIN NOW That heard the Adversary, who, roving still END
BEGIN NOW About the world, at that assembly famed END
BEGIN NOW Would not be last, and, with the voice divine END
BEGIN NOW Nigh thunder-struck, the exalted man to whom END
BEGIN NOW Such high attest was given a while surveyed END
BEGIN NOW With wonder; then, with envy fraught and rage, END
BEGIN NOW Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air END
BEGIN NOW To council summons all his mighty Peers, END
BEGIN NOW Within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved, END
BEGIN NOW A gloomy consistory; and them amidst, END
BEGIN NOW With looks aghast and sad, he thus bespake:-- END
BEGIN NOW O ancient Powers of Air and this wide World END
BEGIN NOW (For much more willingly I mention Air, END
BEGIN NOW This our old conquest, than remember Hell, END
BEGIN NOW Our hated habitation), well ye know END
BEGIN NOW How many ages, as the years of men, END
BEGIN NOW This Universe we have possessed, and ruled END
BEGIN NOW In manner at our will the affairs of Earth, END
BEGIN NOW Since Adam and his facile consort Eve END
BEGIN NOW Lost Paradise, deceived by me, though since END
BEGIN NOW With dread attending when that fatal wound END
BEGIN NOW Shall be inflicted by the seed of Eve END
BEGIN NOW Upon my head. Long the decrees of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Delay, for longest time to Him is short; END
BEGIN NOW And now, too soon for us, the circling hours END
BEGIN NOW This dreaded time have compassed, wherein we END
BEGIN NOW Must bide the stroke of that long-threatened wound END
BEGIN NOW (At least, if so we can, and by the head END
BEGIN NOW Broken be not intended all our power END
BEGIN NOW To be infringed, our freedom and our being END
BEGIN NOW In this fair empire won of Earth and Air)-- END
BEGIN NOW For this ill news I bring: The Woman's Seed, END
BEGIN NOW Destined to this, is late of woman born. END
BEGIN NOW His birth to our just fear gave no small cause; END
BEGIN NOW But his growth now to youth's full flower, displaying END
BEGIN NOW All virtue, grace and wisdom to achieve END
BEGIN NOW Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear. END
BEGIN NOW Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim END
BEGIN NOW His coming, is sent harbinger, who all END
BEGIN NOW Invites, and in the consecrated stream END
BEGIN NOW Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so END
BEGIN NOW Purified to receive him pure, or rather END
BEGIN NOW To do him honour as their King. All come, END
BEGIN NOW And he himself among them was baptized-- END
BEGIN NOW Not thence to be more pure, but to receive END
BEGIN NOW The testimony of Heaven, that who he is END
BEGIN NOW Thenceforth the nations may not doubt. I saw END
BEGIN NOW The Prophet do him reverence; on him, rising END
BEGIN NOW Out of the water, Heaven above the clouds END
BEGIN NOW Unfold her crystal doors; thence on his head END
BEGIN NOW A perfet Dove descend (whate'er it meant); END
BEGIN NOW And out of Heaven the sovraign voice I heard, END
BEGIN NOW 'This is my Son beloved,--in him am pleased.' END
BEGIN NOW His mother, than, is mortal, but his Sire END
BEGIN NOW He who obtains the monarchy of Heaven; END
BEGIN NOW And what will He not do to advance his Son? END
BEGIN NOW His first-begot we know, and sore have felt, END
BEGIN NOW When his fierce thunder drove us to the Deep; END
BEGIN NOW Who this is we must learn, for Man he seems END
BEGIN NOW In all his lineaments, though in his face END
BEGIN NOW The glimpses of his Father's glory shine. END
BEGIN NOW Ye see our danger on the utmost edge END
BEGIN NOW Of hazard, which admits no long debate, END
BEGIN NOW But must with something sudden be opposed END
BEGIN NOW (Not force, but well-couched fraud, well-woven snares), END
BEGIN NOW Ere in the head of nations he appear, END
BEGIN NOW Their king, their leader, and supreme on Earth. END
BEGIN NOW I, when no other durst, sole undertook END
BEGIN NOW The dismal expedition to find out END
BEGIN NOW And ruin Adam, and the exploit performed END
BEGIN NOW Successfully: a calmer voyage now END
BEGIN NOW Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once END
BEGIN NOW Induces best to hope of like success. END
BEGIN NOW He ended, and his words impression left END
BEGIN NOW Of much amazement to the infernal crew, END
BEGIN NOW Distracted and surprised with deep dismay END
BEGIN NOW At these sad tidings. But no time was then END
BEGIN NOW For long indulgence to their fears or grief: END
BEGIN NOW Unanimous they all commit the care END
BEGIN NOW And management of this man enterprise END
BEGIN NOW To him, their great Dictator, whose attempt END
BEGIN NOW At first against mankind so well had thrived END
BEGIN NOW In Adam's overthrow, and led their march END
BEGIN NOW From Hell's deep-vaulted den to dwell in light, END
BEGIN NOW Regents, and potentates, and kings, yea gods, END
BEGIN NOW Of many a pleasant realm and province wide. END
BEGIN NOW So to the coast of Jordan he directs END
BEGIN NOW His easy steps, girded with snaky wiles, END
BEGIN NOW Where he might likeliest find this new-declared, END
BEGIN NOW This man of men, attested Son of God, END
BEGIN NOW Temptation and all guile on him to try-- END
BEGIN NOW So to subvert whom he suspected raised END
BEGIN NOW To end his reign on Earth so long enjoyed: END
BEGIN NOW But, contrary, unweeting he fulfilled END
BEGIN NOW The purposed counsel, pre-ordained and fixed, END
BEGIN NOW Of the Most High, who, in full frequence bright END
BEGIN NOW Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling spake:-- END
BEGIN NOW Gabriel, this day, by proof, thou shalt behold, END
BEGIN NOW Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth END
BEGIN NOW With Man or men's affairs, how I begin END
BEGIN NOW To verify that solemn message late, END
BEGIN NOW On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure END
BEGIN NOW In Galilee, that she should bear a son, END
BEGIN NOW Great in renown, and called the Son of God. END
BEGIN NOW Then told'st her, doubting how these things could be END
BEGIN NOW To her a virgin, that on her should come END
BEGIN NOW The Holy Ghost, and the power of the Highest END
BEGIN NOW O'ershadow her. This Man, born and now upgrown, END
BEGIN NOW To shew him worthy of his birth divine END
BEGIN NOW And high prediction, henceforth I expose END
BEGIN NOW To Satan; let him tempt, and now assay END
BEGIN NOW His utmost subtlety, because he boasts END
BEGIN NOW And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng END
BEGIN NOW Of his Apostasy. He might have learnt END
BEGIN NOW Less overweening, since he failed in Job, END
BEGIN NOW Whose constant perseverance overcame END
BEGIN NOW Whate'er his cruel malice could invent. END
BEGIN NOW He now shall know I can produce a man, END
BEGIN NOW Of female seed, far abler to resist END
BEGIN NOW All his solicitations, and at length END
BEGIN NOW All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell-- END
BEGIN NOW Winning by conquest what the first man lost END
BEGIN NOW By fallacy surprised. But first I mean END
BEGIN NOW To exercise him in the Wilderness; END
BEGIN NOW There he shall first lay down the rudiments END
BEGIN NOW Of his great warfare, ere I send him forth END
BEGIN NOW To conquer Sin and Death, the two grand foes. END
BEGIN NOW By humiliation and strong sufferance END
BEGIN NOW His weakness shall o'ercome Satanic strength, END
BEGIN NOW And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh; END
BEGIN NOW That all the Angels and aethereal Powers-- END
BEGIN NOW They now, and men hereafter--may discern END
BEGIN NOW From what consummate virtue I have chose END
BEGIN NOW This perfet man, by merit called my Son, END
BEGIN NOW To earn salvation for the sons of men. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Admiring stood a space; then into hymns END
BEGIN NOW Burst forth, and in celestial measures moved, END
BEGIN NOW Circling the throne and singing, while the hand END
BEGIN NOW Sung with the voice, and this the argument:-- END
BEGIN NOW Victory and triumph to the Son of God, END
BEGIN NOW Now entering his great duel, not of arms, END
BEGIN NOW But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles! END
BEGIN NOW The Father knows the Son; therefore secure END
BEGIN NOW Ventures his filial virtue, though untried, END
BEGIN NOW Against whate'er may tempt, whate'er seduce, END
BEGIN NOW Allure, or terrify, or undermine. END
BEGIN NOW Be frustrate, all ye stratagems of Hell, END
BEGIN NOW And, devilish machinations, come to nought! END
BEGIN NOW So they in Heaven their odes and vigils tuned. END
BEGIN NOW Meanwhile the Son of God, who yet some days END
BEGIN NOW Lodged in Bethabara, where John baptized, END
BEGIN NOW Musing and much revolving in his breast END
BEGIN NOW How best the mighty work he might begin END
BEGIN NOW Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first END
BEGIN NOW Publish his godlike office now mature, END
BEGIN NOW One day forth walked alone, the Spirit leading END
BEGIN NOW And his deep thoughts, the better to converse END
BEGIN NOW With solitude, till, far from track of men, END
BEGIN NOW Thought following thought, and step by step led on, END
BEGIN NOW He entered now the bordering Desert wild, END
BEGIN NOW And, with dark shades and rocks environed round, END
BEGIN NOW His holy meditations thus pursued:-- END
BEGIN NOW O what a multitude of thoughts at once END
BEGIN NOW Awakened in me swarm, while I consider END
BEGIN NOW What from within I feel myself, and hear END
BEGIN NOW What from without comes often to my ears, END
BEGIN NOW Ill sorting with my present state compared! END
BEGIN NOW When I was yet a child, no childish play END
BEGIN NOW To me was pleasing; all my mind was set END
BEGIN NOW Serious to learn and know, and thence to do, END
BEGIN NOW What might be public good; myself I thought END
BEGIN NOW Born to that end, born to promote all truth, END
BEGIN NOW All righteous things. Therefore, above my years, END
BEGIN NOW The Law of God I read, and found it sweet; END
BEGIN NOW Made it my whole delight, and in it grew END
BEGIN NOW To such perfection that, ere yet my age END
BEGIN NOW Had measured twice six years, at our great Feast END
BEGIN NOW I went into the Temple, there to hear END
BEGIN NOW The teachers of our Law, and to propose END
BEGIN NOW What might improve my knowledge or their own, END
BEGIN NOW And was admired by all. Yet this not all END
BEGIN NOW To which my spirit aspired. Victorious deeds END
BEGIN NOW Flamed in my heart, heroic acts--one while END
BEGIN NOW To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke; END
BEGIN NOW Then to subdue and quell, o'er all the earth, END
BEGIN NOW Brute violence and proud tyrannic power, END
BEGIN NOW Till truth were freed, and equity restored: END
BEGIN NOW Yet held it more humane, more heavenly, first END
BEGIN NOW By winning words to conquer willing hearts, END
BEGIN NOW And make persuasion do the work of fear; END
BEGIN NOW At least to try, and teach the erring soul, END
BEGIN NOW Not wilfully misdoing, but unware END
BEGIN NOW Misled; the stubborn only to subdue. END
BEGIN NOW These growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving, END
BEGIN NOW By words at times cast forth, inly rejoiced, END
BEGIN NOW And said to me apart, 'High are thy thoughts, END
BEGIN NOW O Son! but nourish them, and let them soar END
BEGIN NOW To what highth sacred virtue and true worth END
BEGIN NOW Can raise them, though above example high; END
BEGIN NOW By matchless deeds express thy matchless Sire. END
BEGIN NOW For know, thou art no son of mortal man; END
BEGIN NOW Though men esteem thee low of parentage, END
BEGIN NOW Thy Father is the Eternal King who rules END
BEGIN NOW All Heaven and Earth, Angels and sons of men. END
BEGIN NOW A messenger from God foretold thy birth END
BEGIN NOW Conceived in me a virgin; he foretold END
BEGIN NOW Thou shouldst be great, and sit on David's throne, END
BEGIN NOW And of thy kingdom there should be no end. END
BEGIN NOW At thy nativity a glorious quire END
BEGIN NOW Of Angels, in the fields of Bethlehem, sung END
BEGIN NOW To shepherds, watching at their folds by night, END
BEGIN NOW And told them the Messiah now was born, END
BEGIN NOW Where they might see him; and to thee they came, END
BEGIN NOW Directed to the manger where thou lay'st; END
BEGIN NOW For in the inn was left no better room. END
BEGIN NOW A Star, not seen before, in heaven appearing, END
BEGIN NOW Guided the Wise Men thither from the East, END
BEGIN NOW To honour thee with incense, myrrh, and gold; END
BEGIN NOW By whose bright course led on they found the place, END
BEGIN NOW Affirming it thy star, new-graven in heaven, END
BEGIN NOW By which they knew thee King of Israel born. END
BEGIN NOW Just Simeon and prophetic Anna, warned END
BEGIN NOW By vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake, END
BEGIN NOW Before the altar and the vested priest, END
BEGIN NOW Like things of thee to all that present stood.' END
BEGIN NOW This having heart, straight I again revolved END
BEGIN NOW The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ END
BEGIN NOW Concerning the Messiah, to our scribes END
BEGIN NOW Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake END
BEGIN NOW I am--this chiefly, that my way must lie END
BEGIN NOW Through many a hard assay, even to the death, END
BEGIN NOW Ere I the promised kingdom can attain, END
BEGIN NOW Or work redemption for mankind, whose sins' END
BEGIN NOW Full weight must be transferred upon my head. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, neither thus disheartened or dismayed, END
BEGIN NOW The time prefixed I waited; when behold END
BEGIN NOW The Baptist (of whose birth I oft had heard, END
BEGIN NOW Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come END
BEGIN NOW Before Messiah, and his way prepare! END
BEGIN NOW I, as all others, to his baptism came, END
BEGIN NOW Which I believed was from above; but he END
BEGIN NOW Straight knew me, and with loudest voice proclaimed END
BEGIN NOW Me him (for it was shewn him so from Heaven)-- END
BEGIN NOW Me him whose harbinger he was; and first END
BEGIN NOW Refused on me his baptism to confer, END
BEGIN NOW As much his greater, and was hardly won. END
BEGIN NOW But, as I rose out of the laving stream, END
BEGIN NOW Heaven opened her eternal doors, from whence END
BEGIN NOW The Spirit descended on me like a Dove; END
BEGIN NOW And last, the sum of all, my Father's voice, END
BEGIN NOW Audibly heard from Heaven, pronounced me his, END
BEGIN NOW Me his beloved Son, in whom alone END
BEGIN NOW He was well pleased: by which I knew the time END
BEGIN NOW Now full, that I no more should live obscure, END
BEGIN NOW But openly begin, as best becomes END
BEGIN NOW The authority which I derived from Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW And now by some strong motion I am led END
BEGIN NOW Into this wilderness; to what intent END
BEGIN NOW I learn not yet. Perhaps I need not know; END
BEGIN NOW For what concerns my knowledge God reveals. END
BEGIN NOW So spake our Morning Star, then in his rise, END
BEGIN NOW And, looking round, on every side beheld END
BEGIN NOW A pathless desert, dusk with horrid shades. END
BEGIN NOW The way he came, not having marked return, END
BEGIN NOW Was difficult, by human steps untrod; END
BEGIN NOW And he still on was led, but with such thoughts END
BEGIN NOW Accompanied of things past and to come END
BEGIN NOW Lodged in his breast as well might recommend END
BEGIN NOW Such solitude before choicest society. END
BEGIN NOW Full forty days he passed--whether on hill END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night END
BEGIN NOW Under the covert of some ancient oak END
BEGIN NOW Or cedar to defend him from the dew, END
BEGIN NOW Or harboured in one cave, is not revealed; END
BEGIN NOW Nor tasted human food, nor hunger felt, END
BEGIN NOW Till those days ended; hungered then at last END
BEGIN NOW Among wild beasts. They at his sight grew mild, END
BEGIN NOW Nor sleeping him nor waking harmed; his walk END
BEGIN NOW The fiery serpent fled and noxious worm; END
BEGIN NOW The lion and fierce tiger glared aloof. END
BEGIN NOW But now an aged man in rural weeds, END
BEGIN NOW Following, as seemed, the quest of some stray eye, END
BEGIN NOW Or withered sticks to gather, which might serve END
BEGIN NOW Against a winter's day, when winds blow keen, END
BEGIN NOW To warm him wet returned from field at eve, END
BEGIN NOW He saw approach; who first with curious eye END
BEGIN NOW Perused him, then with words thus uttered spake:-- END
BEGIN NOW Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place, END
BEGIN NOW So far from path or road of men, who pass END
BEGIN NOW In troop or caravan? for single none END
BEGIN NOW Durst ever, who returned, and dropt not here END
BEGIN NOW His carcass, pined with hunger and with droughth. END
BEGIN NOW I ask the rather, and the more admire, END
BEGIN NOW For that to me thou seem'st the man whom late END
BEGIN NOW Our new baptizing Prophet at the ford END
BEGIN NOW Of Jordan honoured so, and called thee Son END
BEGIN NOW Of God. I saw and heard, for we sometimes END
BEGIN NOW Who dwell this wild, constrained by want, come forth END
BEGIN NOW To town or village nigh (nighest is far), END
BEGIN NOW Where aught we hear, and curious are to hear, END
BEGIN NOW What happens new; fame also finds us out. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Son of God:--"Who brought me hither END
BEGIN NOW Will bring me hence; no other guide I seek. END
BEGIN NOW By miracle he may," replied the swain; END
BEGIN NOW What other way I see not; for we here END
BEGIN NOW Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inured END
BEGIN NOW More than the camel, and to drink go far-- END
BEGIN NOW Men to much misery and hardship born. END
BEGIN NOW But, if thou be the Son of God, command END
BEGIN NOW That out of these hard stones be made thee bread; END
BEGIN NOW So shalt thou save thyself, and us relieve END
BEGIN NOW With food, whereof we wretched seldom taste. END
BEGIN NOW He ended, and the Son of God replied:-- END
BEGIN NOW Think'st thou such force in bread? Is it not written END
BEGIN NOW (For I discern thee other than thou seem'st), END
BEGIN NOW Man lives not by bread only, but each word END
BEGIN NOW Proceeding from the mouth of God, who fed END
BEGIN NOW Our fathers here with manna? In the Mount END
BEGIN NOW Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank; END
BEGIN NOW And forty days Eliah without food END
BEGIN NOW Wandered this barren waste; the same I now. END
BEGIN NOW Why dost thou, then, suggest to me distrust END
BEGIN NOW Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art? END
BEGIN NOW Whom thus answered the Arch-Fiend, now undisguised:-- END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate END
BEGIN NOW Who, leagued with millions more in rash revolt, END
BEGIN NOW Kept not my happy station, but was driven END
BEGIN NOW With them from bliss to the bottomless Deep-- END
BEGIN NOW Yet to that hideous place not so confined END
BEGIN NOW By rigour unconniving but that oft, END
BEGIN NOW Leaving my dolorous prison, I enjoy END
BEGIN NOW Large liberty to round this globe of Earth, END
BEGIN NOW Or range in the Air; nor from the Heaven of Heavens END
BEGIN NOW Hath he excluded my resort sometimes. END
BEGIN NOW I came, among the Sons of God, when he END
BEGIN NOW Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job, END
BEGIN NOW To prove him, and illustrate his high worth; END
BEGIN NOW And, when to all his Angels he proposed END
BEGIN NOW To draw the proud king Ahab into fraud, END
BEGIN NOW That he might fall in Ramoth, they demurring, END
BEGIN NOW I undertook that office, and the tongues END
BEGIN NOW Of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies END
BEGIN NOW To his destruction, as I had in charge: END
BEGIN NOW For what he bids I do. Though I have lost END
BEGIN NOW Much lustre of my native brightness, lost END
BEGIN NOW To be beloved of God, I have not lost END
BEGIN NOW To love, at least contemplate and admire, END
BEGIN NOW What I see excellent in good, or fair, END
BEGIN NOW Or virtuous; I should so have lost all sense. END
BEGIN NOW What can be then less in me than desire END
BEGIN NOW To see thee and approach thee, whom I know END
BEGIN NOW Declared the Son of God, to hear attent END
BEGIN NOW Thy wisdom, and behold thy godlike deeds? END
BEGIN NOW Men generally think me much a foe END
BEGIN NOW To all mankind. Why should I? they to me END
BEGIN NOW Never did wrong or violence. By them END
BEGIN NOW I lost not what I lost; rather by them END
BEGIN NOW I gained what I have gained, and with them dwell END
BEGIN NOW Copartner in these regions of the World, END
BEGIN NOW If not disposer--lend them oft my aid, END
BEGIN NOW Oft my advice by presages and signs, END
BEGIN NOW And answers, oracles, portents, and dreams, END
BEGIN NOW Whereby they may direct their future life. END
BEGIN NOW Envy, they say, excites me, thus to gain END
BEGIN NOW Companions of my misery and woe! END
BEGIN NOW At first it may be; but, long since with woe END
BEGIN NOW Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof END
BEGIN NOW That fellowship in pain divides not smart, END
BEGIN NOW Nor lightens aught each man's peculiar load; END
BEGIN NOW Small consolation, then, were Man adjoined. END
BEGIN NOW This wounds me most (what can it less?) that Man, END
BEGIN NOW Man fallen, shall be restored, I never more. END
BEGIN NOW To whom our Saviour sternly thus replied:-- END
BEGIN NOW Deservedly thou griev'st, composed of lies END
BEGIN NOW From the beginning, and in lies wilt end, END
BEGIN NOW Who boast'st release from Hell, and leave to come END
BEGIN NOW Into the Heaven of Heavens. Thou com'st, indeed, END
BEGIN NOW As a poor miserable captive thrall END
BEGIN NOW Comes to the place where he before had sat END
BEGIN NOW Among the prime in splendour, now deposed, END
BEGIN NOW Ejected, emptied, gazed, unpitied, shunned, END
BEGIN NOW A spectacle of ruin, or of scorn, END
BEGIN NOW To all the host of Heaven. The happy place END
BEGIN NOW Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy-- END
BEGIN NOW Rather inflames thy torment, representing END
BEGIN NOW Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable; END
BEGIN NOW So never more in Hell than when in Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW But thou art serviceable to Heaven's King! END
BEGIN NOW Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear END
BEGIN NOW Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites? END
BEGIN NOW What but thy malice moved thee to misdeem END
BEGIN NOW Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him END
BEGIN NOW With all inflictions? but his patience won. END
BEGIN NOW The other service was thy chosen task, END
BEGIN NOW To be a liar in four hundred mouths; END
BEGIN NOW For lying is thy sustenance, thy food. END
BEGIN NOW Yet thou pretend'st to truth! all oracles END
BEGIN NOW By thee are given, and what confessed more true END
BEGIN NOW Among the nations? That hath been thy craft, END
BEGIN NOW By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies. END
BEGIN NOW But what have been thy answers? what but dark, END
BEGIN NOW Ambiguous, and with double sense deluding, END
BEGIN NOW Which they who asked have seldom understood, END
BEGIN NOW And, not well understood, as good not known? END
BEGIN NOW Who ever, by consulting at thy shrine, END
BEGIN NOW Returned the wiser, or the more instruct END
BEGIN NOW To fly or follow what concerned him most, END
BEGIN NOW And run not sooner to his fatal snare? END
BEGIN NOW For God hath justly given the nations up END
BEGIN NOW To thy delusions; justly, since they fell END
BEGIN NOW Idolatrous. But, when his purpose is END
BEGIN NOW Among them to declare his providence, END
BEGIN NOW To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth, END
BEGIN NOW But from him, or his Angels president END
BEGIN NOW In every province, who, themselves disdaining END
BEGIN NOW To approach thy temples, give thee in command END
BEGIN NOW To thy adorers? Thou, with trembling fear, END
BEGIN NOW Or like a fawning parasite, obey'st; END
BEGIN NOW Then to thyself ascrib'st the truth foretold. END
BEGIN NOW But this thy glory shall be soon retrenched; END
BEGIN NOW No more shalt thou by oracling abuse END
BEGIN NOW The Gentiles; henceforth oracles are ceased, END
BEGIN NOW And thou no more with pomp and sacrifice END
BEGIN NOW Shalt be enquired at Delphos or elsewhere-- END
BEGIN NOW At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute. END
BEGIN NOW God hath now sent his living Oracle END
BEGIN NOW Into the world to teach his final will, END
BEGIN NOW And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell END
BEGIN NOW In pious hearts, an inward oracle END
BEGIN NOW To all truth requisite for men to know. END
BEGIN NOW So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend, END
BEGIN NOW Though inly stung with anger and disdain, END
BEGIN NOW Dissembled, and this answer smooth returned:-- END
BEGIN NOW Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke, END
BEGIN NOW And urged me hard with doings which not will, END
BEGIN NOW But misery, hath wrested from me. Where END
BEGIN NOW Easily canst thou find one miserable, END
BEGIN NOW And not inforced oft-times to part from truth, END
BEGIN NOW If it may stand him more in stead to lie, END
BEGIN NOW Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure? END
BEGIN NOW But thou art placed above me; thou art Lord; END
BEGIN NOW From thee I can, and must, submiss, endure END
BEGIN NOW Cheek or reproof, and glad to scape so quit. END
BEGIN NOW Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk, END
BEGIN NOW Smooth on the tongue discoursed, pleasing to the ear, END
BEGIN NOW And tunable as sylvan pipe or song; END
BEGIN NOW What wonder, then, if I delight to hear END
BEGIN NOW Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire END
BEGIN NOW Virtue who follow not her lore. Permit me END
BEGIN NOW To hear thee when I come (since no man comes), END
BEGIN NOW And talk at least, though I despair to attain. END
BEGIN NOW Thy Father, who is holy, wise, and pure, END
BEGIN NOW Suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest END
BEGIN NOW To tread his sacred courts, and minister END
BEGIN NOW About his altar, handling holy things, END
BEGIN NOW Praying or vowing, and voutsafed his voice END
BEGIN NOW To Balaam reprobate, a prophet yet END
BEGIN NOW Inspired: disdain not such access to me. END
BEGIN NOW To whom our Saviour, with unaltered brow:-- END
BEGIN NOW Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope, END
BEGIN NOW I bid not, or forbid. Do as thou find'st END
BEGIN NOW Permission from above; thou canst not more. END
BEGIN NOW He added not; and Satan, bowling low END
BEGIN NOW His gray dissimulation, disappeared, END
BEGIN NOW Into thin air diffused: for now began END
BEGIN NOW Night with her sullen wing to double-shade END
BEGIN NOW The desert; fowls in their clay nests were couched; END
BEGIN NOW And now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam. END
BEGIN NOW MEANWHILE the new-baptized, who yet remained END
BEGIN NOW At Jordan with the Baptist, and had seen END
BEGIN NOW Him whom they heard so late expressly called END
BEGIN NOW Jesus Messiah, Son of God, declared, END
BEGIN NOW And on that high authority had believed, END
BEGIN NOW And with him talked, and with him lodged--I mean END
BEGIN NOW Andrew and Simon, famous after known, END
BEGIN NOW With others, though in Holy Writ not named-- END
BEGIN NOW Now missing him, their joy so lately found, END
BEGIN NOW So lately found and so abruptly gone, END
BEGIN NOW Began to doubt, and doubted many days, END
BEGIN NOW And, as the days increased, increased their doubt. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn, END
BEGIN NOW And for a time caught up to God, as once END
BEGIN NOW Moses was in the Mount and missing long, END
BEGIN NOW And the great Thisbite, who on fiery wheels END
BEGIN NOW Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore, as those young prophets then with care END
BEGIN NOW Sought lost Eliah, so in each place these END
BEGIN NOW Nigh to Bethabara--in Jericho END
BEGIN NOW The city of palms, AEnon, and Salem old, END
BEGIN NOW Machaerus, and each town or city walled END
BEGIN NOW On this side the broad lake Genezaret, END
BEGIN NOW Or in Peraea--but returned in vain. END
BEGIN NOW Then on the bank of Jordan, by a creek, END
BEGIN NOW Where winds with reeds and osiers whispering play, END
BEGIN NOW Plain fishermen (no greater men them call), END
BEGIN NOW Close in a cottage low together got, END
BEGIN NOW Their unexpected loss and plaints outbreathed:-- END
BEGIN NOW Alas, from what high hope to what relapse END
BEGIN NOW Unlooked for are we fallen! Our eyes beheld END
BEGIN NOW Messiah certainly now come, so long END
BEGIN NOW Expected of our fathers; we have heard END
BEGIN NOW His words, his wisdom full of grace and truth. END
BEGIN NOW 'Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand; END
BEGIN NOW The kingdom shall to Israel be restored:' END
BEGIN NOW Thus we rejoiced, but soon our joy is turned END
BEGIN NOW Into perplexity and new amaze. END
BEGIN NOW For whither is he gone? what accident END
BEGIN NOW Hath rapt him from us? will he now retire END
BEGIN NOW After appearance, and again prolong END
BEGIN NOW Our expectation? God of Israel, END
BEGIN NOW Send thy Messiah forth; the time is come. END
BEGIN NOW Behold the kings of the earth, how they oppress END
BEGIN NOW Thy Chosen, to what highth their power unjust END
BEGIN NOW They have exalted, and behind them cast END
BEGIN NOW All fear of Thee; arise, and vindicate END
BEGIN NOW Thy glory; free thy people from their yoke! END
BEGIN NOW But let us wait; thus far He hath performed-- END
BEGIN NOW Sent his Anointed, and to us revealed him END
BEGIN NOW By his great Prophet pointed at and shown END
BEGIN NOW In public, and with him we have conversed. END
BEGIN NOW Let us be glad of this, and all our fears END
BEGIN NOW Lay on his providence; He will not fail, END
BEGIN NOW Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall-- END
BEGIN NOW Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence: END
BEGIN NOW Soon we shall see our hope, our joy, return. END
BEGIN NOW Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume END
BEGIN NOW To find whom at the first they found unsought. END
BEGIN NOW But to his mother Mary, when she saw END
BEGIN NOW Others returned from baptism, not her Son, END
BEGIN NOW Nor left at Jordan tidings of him none, END
BEGIN NOW Within her breast though calm, her breast though pure, END
BEGIN NOW Motherly cares and fears got head, and raised END
BEGIN NOW Some troubled thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad:-- END
BEGIN NOW Oh, what avails me now that honour high, END
BEGIN NOW To have conceived of God, or that salute, END
BEGIN NOW 'Hail, highly favoured, among women blest!' END
BEGIN NOW While I to sorrows am no less advanced, END
BEGIN NOW And fears as eminent above the lot END
BEGIN NOW Of other women, by the birth I bore: END
BEGIN NOW In such a season born, when scarce a shed END
BEGIN NOW Could be obtained to shelter him or me END
BEGIN NOW From the bleak air? A stable was our warmth, END
BEGIN NOW A manger his; yet soon enforced to fly END
BEGIN NOW Were dead, who sought his life, and, missing, filled END
BEGIN NOW With infant blood the streets of Bethlehem. END
BEGIN NOW Hath been our dwelling many years; his life END
BEGIN NOW Private, unactive, calm, contemplative, END
BEGIN NOW Little suspicious to any king. But now, END
BEGIN NOW Full grown to man, acknowledged, as I hear, END
BEGIN NOW By John the Baptist, and in public shewn, END
BEGIN NOW Son owned from Heaven by his Father's voice, END
BEGIN NOW I looked for some great change. To honour? no; END
BEGIN NOW But trouble, as old Simeon plain foretold, END
BEGIN NOW That to the fall and rising he should be END
BEGIN NOW Of many in Israel, and to a sign END
BEGIN NOW Spoken against--that through my very soul END
BEGIN NOW A sword shall pierce. This is my favoured lot, END
BEGIN NOW My exaltation to afflictions high! END
BEGIN NOW Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest! END
BEGIN NOW I will not argue that, nor will repine. END
BEGIN NOW But where delays he now? Some great intent END
BEGIN NOW Conceals him. When twelve years he scarce had seen, END
BEGIN NOW I lost him, but so found as well I saw END
BEGIN NOW He could not lose himself, but went about END
BEGIN NOW His Father's business. What he meant I mused-- END
BEGIN NOW Since understand; much more his absence now END
BEGIN NOW Thus long to some great purpose he obscures. END
BEGIN NOW But I to wait with patience am inured; END
BEGIN NOW My heart hath been a storehouse long of things END
BEGIN NOW And sayings laid up, pretending strange events. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Mary, pondering oft, and oft to mind END
BEGIN NOW Recalling what remarkably had passed END
BEGIN NOW Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts END
BEGIN NOW Meekly composed awaited the fulfilling: END
BEGIN NOW The while her Son, tracing the desert wild, END
BEGIN NOW Sole, but with holiest meditations fed, END
BEGIN NOW Into himself descended, and at once END
BEGIN NOW All his great work to come before him set-- END
BEGIN NOW How to begin, how to accomplish best END
BEGIN NOW His end of being on Earth, and mission high. END
BEGIN NOW For Satan, with sly preface to return, END
BEGIN NOW Had left him vacant, and with speed was gone END
BEGIN NOW Up to the middle region of thick air, END
BEGIN NOW Where all his Potentates in council sate. END
BEGIN NOW There, without sign of boast, or sign of joy, END
BEGIN NOW Solicitous and blank, he thus began:-- END
BEGIN NOW Princes, Heaven's ancient Sons, AEthereal Thrones-- END
BEGIN NOW Daemonian Spirits now, from the element END
BEGIN NOW Each of his reign allotted, rightlier called END
BEGIN NOW Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath END
BEGIN NOW (So may we hold our place and these mild seats END
BEGIN NOW Without new trouble!)--such an enemy END
BEGIN NOW Is risen to invade us, who no less END
BEGIN NOW Threatens than our expulsion down to Hell. END
BEGIN NOW I, as I undertook, and with the vote END
BEGIN NOW Consenting in full frequence was impowered, END
BEGIN NOW Have found him, viewed him, tasted him; but find END
BEGIN NOW Far other labour to be undergone END
BEGIN NOW Than when I dealt with Adam, first of men, END
BEGIN NOW Though Adam by his wife's allurement fell, END
BEGIN NOW However to this Man inferior far-- END
BEGIN NOW If he be Man by mother's side, at least END
BEGIN NOW With more than human gifts from Heaven adorned, END
BEGIN NOW Perfections absolute, graces divine, END
BEGIN NOW And amplitude of mind to greatest deeds. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore I am returned, lest confidence END
BEGIN NOW Of my success with Eve in Paradise END
BEGIN NOW Deceive ye to persuasion over-sure END
BEGIN NOW Of like succeeding here. I summon all END
BEGIN NOW Rather to be in readiness with hand END
BEGIN NOW Or counsel to assist, lest I, who erst END
BEGIN NOW Thought none my equal, now be overmatched. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the old Serpent, doubting, and from all END
BEGIN NOW With clamour was assured their utmost aid END
BEGIN NOW At his command; when from amidst them rose END
BEGIN NOW Belial, the dissolutest Spirit that fell, END
BEGIN NOW The sensualest, and, after Asmodai, END
BEGIN NOW The fleshliest Incubus, and thus advised:-- END
BEGIN NOW Set women in his eye and in his walk, END
BEGIN NOW Among daughters of men the fairest found. END
BEGIN NOW Many are in each region passing fair END
BEGIN NOW As the noon sky, more like to goddesses END
BEGIN NOW Than mortal creatures, graceful and discreet, END
BEGIN NOW Expert in amorous arts, enchanting tongues END
BEGIN NOW Persuasive, virgin majesty with mild END
BEGIN NOW And sweet allayed, yet terrible to approach, END
BEGIN NOW Skilled to retire, and in retiring draw END
BEGIN NOW Hearts after them tangled in amorous nets. END
BEGIN NOW Such object hath the power to soften and tame END
BEGIN NOW Severest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow, END
BEGIN NOW Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve, END
BEGIN NOW Draw out with credulous desire, and lead END
BEGIN NOW At will the manliest, resolutest breast, END
BEGIN NOW As the magnetic hardest iron draws. END
BEGIN NOW Women, when nothing else, beguiled the heart END
BEGIN NOW Of wisest Solomon, and made him build, END
BEGIN NOW And made him bow, to the gods of his wives. END
BEGIN NOW To whom quick answer Satan thus returned:-- END
BEGIN NOW Belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh'st END
BEGIN NOW All others by thyself. Because of old END
BEGIN NOW Thou thyself doat'st on womankind, admiring END
BEGIN NOW Their shape, their colour, and attractive grace, END
BEGIN NOW None are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys. END
BEGIN NOW Before the Flood, thou, with thy lusty crew, END
BEGIN NOW False titled Sons of God, roaming the Earth, END
BEGIN NOW Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men, END
BEGIN NOW And coupled with them, and begot a race. END
BEGIN NOW Have we not seen, or by relation heard, END
BEGIN NOW In courts and regal chambers how thou lurk'st, END
BEGIN NOW In wood or grove, by mossy fountain-side, END
BEGIN NOW In valley or green meadow, to waylay END
BEGIN NOW Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene, END
BEGIN NOW Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more END
BEGIN NOW Too long--then lay'st thy scapes on names adored, END
BEGIN NOW Satyr, or Faun, or Silvan? But these haunts END
BEGIN NOW Delight not all. Among the sons of men END
BEGIN NOW How many have with a smile made small account END
BEGIN NOW Of beauty and her lures, easily scorned END
BEGIN NOW All her assaults, on worthier things intent! END
BEGIN NOW Remember that Pellean conqueror, END
BEGIN NOW A youth, how all the beauties of the East END
BEGIN NOW He slightly viewed, and slightly overpassed; END
BEGIN NOW How he surnamed of Africa dismissed, END
BEGIN NOW In his prime youth, the fair Iberian maid. END
BEGIN NOW For Solomon, he lived at ease, and, full END
BEGIN NOW Of honour, wealth, high fare, aimed not beyond END
BEGIN NOW Higher design than to enjoy his state; END
BEGIN NOW Thence to the bait of women lay exposed. END
BEGIN NOW But he whom we attempt is wiser far END
BEGIN NOW Than Solomon, of more exalted mind, END
BEGIN NOW Made and set wholly on the accomplishment END
BEGIN NOW Of greatest things. What woman will you find, END
BEGIN NOW Though of this age the wonder and the fame, END
BEGIN NOW On whom his leisure will voutsafe an eye END
BEGIN NOW Of fond desire? Or should she, confident, END
BEGIN NOW As sitting queen adored on Beauty's throne, END
BEGIN NOW Descend with all her winning charms begirt END
BEGIN NOW To enamour, as the zone of Venus once END
BEGIN NOW Wrought that effect on Jove (so fables tell), END
BEGIN NOW How would one look from his majestic brow, END
BEGIN NOW Seated as on the top of Virtue's hill, END
BEGIN NOW Discountenance her despised, and put to rout END
BEGIN NOW All her array, her female pride deject, END
BEGIN NOW Or turn to reverent awe! For Beauty stands END
BEGIN NOW In the admiration only of weak minds END
BEGIN NOW Led captive; cease to admire, and all her plumes END
BEGIN NOW Fall flat, and shrink into a trivial toy, END
BEGIN NOW At every sudden slighting quite abashed. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore with manlier objects we must try END
BEGIN NOW His constancy--with such as have more shew END
BEGIN NOW Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise END
BEGIN NOW (Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wrecked); END
BEGIN NOW Or that which only seems to satisfy END
BEGIN NOW Lawful desires of nature, not beyond. END
BEGIN NOW And now I know he hungers, where no food END
BEGIN NOW Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness: END
BEGIN NOW The rest commit to me; I shall let pass END
BEGIN NOW No advantage, and his strength as oft assay. END
BEGIN NOW He ceased, and heard their grant in loud acclaim; END
BEGIN NOW Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band END
BEGIN NOW Of Spirits likest to himself in guile, END
BEGIN NOW To be at hand and at his beck appear, END
BEGIN NOW If cause were to unfold some active scene END
BEGIN NOW Of various persons, each to know his part; END
BEGIN NOW Then to the desert takes with these his flight, END
BEGIN NOW Where still, from shade to shade, the Son of God, END
BEGIN NOW After forty days' fasting, had remained, END
BEGIN NOW Now hungering first, and to himself thus said:-- END
BEGIN NOW Where will this end? Four times ten days I have passed END
BEGIN NOW Wandering this woody maze, and human food END
BEGIN NOW Nor tasted, nor had appetite. That fast END
BEGIN NOW To virtue I impute not, or count part END
BEGIN NOW Of what I suffer here. If nature need not, END
BEGIN NOW Or God support nature without repast, END
BEGIN NOW Though needing, what praise is it to endure? END
BEGIN NOW But now I feel I hunger; which declares END
BEGIN NOW Nature hath need of what she asks. Yet God END
BEGIN NOW Can satisfy that need some other way, END
BEGIN NOW Though hunger still remain. So it remain END
BEGIN NOW Without this body's wasting, I content me, END
BEGIN NOW And from the sting of famine fear no harm; END
BEGIN NOW Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts, that feed END
BEGIN NOW Me hungering more to do my Father's will. END
BEGIN NOW It was the hour of night, when thus the Son END
BEGIN NOW Communed in silent walk, then laid him down END
BEGIN NOW Under the hospitable covert nigh END
BEGIN NOW Of trees thick interwoven. There he slept, END
BEGIN NOW And dreamed, as appetite is wont to dream, END
BEGIN NOW Of meats and drinks, nature's refreshment sweet. END
BEGIN NOW Him thought he by the brook of Cherith stood, END
BEGIN NOW And saw the ravens with their horny beaks END
BEGIN NOW Food to Elijah bringing even and morn-- END
BEGIN NOW Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought; END
BEGIN NOW He saw the Prophet also, how he fled END
BEGIN NOW Into the desert, and how there he slept END
BEGIN NOW Under a juniper--then how, awaked, END
BEGIN NOW He found his supper on the coals prepared, END
BEGIN NOW And by the Angel was bid rise and eat, END
BEGIN NOW And eat the second time after repose, END
BEGIN NOW The strength whereof sufficed him forty days: END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes that with Elijah he partook, END
BEGIN NOW Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse. END
BEGIN NOW Thus wore out night; and now the harald Lark END
BEGIN NOW Left his ground-nest, high towering to descry END
BEGIN NOW The Morn's approach, and greet her with his song. END
BEGIN NOW As lightly from his grassy couch up rose END
BEGIN NOW Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream; END
BEGIN NOW Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting waked. END
BEGIN NOW Up to a hill anon his steps he reared, END
BEGIN NOW From whose high top to ken the prospect round, END
BEGIN NOW If cottage were in view, sheep-cote, or herd; END
BEGIN NOW But cottage, herd, or sheep-cote, none he saw-- END
BEGIN NOW Only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove, END
BEGIN NOW With chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud. END
BEGIN NOW Thither he bent his way, determined there END
BEGIN NOW To rest at noon, and entered soon the shade END
BEGIN NOW High-roofed, and walks beneath, and alleys brown, END
BEGIN NOW That opened in the midst a woody scene; END
BEGIN NOW Nature's own work it seemed (Nature taught Art), END
BEGIN NOW And, to a superstitious eye, the haunt END
BEGIN NOW Of wood-gods and wood-nymphs. He viewed it round; END
BEGIN NOW When suddenly a man before him stood, END
BEGIN NOW Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad, END
BEGIN NOW As one in city or court or palace bred, END
BEGIN NOW And with fair speech these words to him addressed:-- END
BEGIN NOW With granted leave officious I return, END
BEGIN NOW But much more wonder that the Son of God END
BEGIN NOW In this wild solitude so long should bide, END
BEGIN NOW Of all things destitute, and, well I know, END
BEGIN NOW Not without hunger. Others of some note, END
BEGIN NOW As story tells, have trod this wilderness: END
BEGIN NOW The fugitive Bond-woman, with her son, END
BEGIN NOW Outcast Nebaioth, yet found here relief END
BEGIN NOW By a providing Angel; all the race END
BEGIN NOW Of Israel here had famished, had not God END
BEGIN NOW Rained from heaven manna; and that Prophet bold, END
BEGIN NOW Native of Thebez, wandering here, was fed END
BEGIN NOW Twice by a voice inviting him to eat. END
BEGIN NOW Of thee those forty days none hath regard, END
BEGIN NOW Forty and more deserted here indeed. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Jesus:--"What conclud'st thou hence? END
BEGIN NOW They all had need; I, as thou seest, have none. END
BEGIN NOW How hast thou hunger then?" Satan replied. END
BEGIN NOW Tell me, if food were now before thee set, END
BEGIN NOW Wouldst thou not eat?" "Thereafter as I like END
BEGIN NOW the giver," answered Jesus. "Why should that END
BEGIN NOW Cause thy refusal?" said the subtle Fiend. END
BEGIN NOW Hast thou not right to all created things? END
BEGIN NOW Owe not all creatures, by just right, to thee END
BEGIN NOW Duty and service, nor to stay till bid, END
BEGIN NOW But tender all their power? Nor mention I END
BEGIN NOW Meats by the law unclean, or offered first END
BEGIN NOW To idols--those young Daniel could refuse; END
BEGIN NOW Nor proffered by an enemy--though who END
BEGIN NOW Would scruple that, with want oppressed? Behold, END
BEGIN NOW Nature ashamed, or, better to express, END
BEGIN NOW Troubled, that thou shouldst hunger, hath purveyed END
BEGIN NOW From all the elements her choicest store, END
BEGIN NOW To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord END
BEGIN NOW With honour. Only deign to sit and eat. END
BEGIN NOW He spake no dream; for, as his words had end, END
BEGIN NOW Our Saviour, lifting up his eyes, beheld, END
BEGIN NOW In ample space under the broadest shade, END
BEGIN NOW A table richly spread in regal mode, END
BEGIN NOW With dishes piled and meats of noblest sort END
BEGIN NOW And savour--beasts of chase, or fowl of game, END
BEGIN NOW In pastry built, or from the spit, or boiled, END
BEGIN NOW Grisamber-steamed; all fish, from sea or shore, END
BEGIN NOW Freshet or purling brook, of shell or fin, END
BEGIN NOW And exquisitest name, for which was drained END
BEGIN NOW Pontus, and Lucrine bay, and Afric coast. END
BEGIN NOW Alas! how simple, to these cates compared, END
BEGIN NOW Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve! END
BEGIN NOW And at a stately sideboard, by the wine, END
BEGIN NOW That fragrant smell diffused, in order stood END
BEGIN NOW Tall stripling youths rich-clad, of fairer hue END
BEGIN NOW Than Ganymed or Hylas; distant more, END
BEGIN NOW Under the trees now tripped, now solemn stood, END
BEGIN NOW Nymphs of Diana's train, and Naiades END
BEGIN NOW With fruits and flowers from Amalthea's horn, END
BEGIN NOW And ladies of the Hesperides, that seemed END
BEGIN NOW Fairer than feigned of old, or fabled since END
BEGIN NOW Of faery damsels met in forest wide END
BEGIN NOW By knights of Logres, or of Lyones, END
BEGIN NOW And all the while harmonious airs were heard END
BEGIN NOW Of chiming strings or charming pipes; and winds END
BEGIN NOW Of gentlest gale Arabian odours fanned END
BEGIN NOW From their soft wings, and Flora's earliest smells. END
BEGIN NOW Such was the splendour; and the Tempter now END
BEGIN NOW His invitation earnestly renewed:-- END
BEGIN NOW What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat? END
BEGIN NOW These are not fruits forbidden; no interdict END
BEGIN NOW Defends the touching of these viands pure; END
BEGIN NOW Their taste no knowledge works, at least of evil, END
BEGIN NOW But life preserves, destroys life's enemy, END
BEGIN NOW Hunger, with sweet restorative delight. END
BEGIN NOW All these are Spirits of air, and woods, and springs, END
BEGIN NOW Thy gentle ministers, who come to pay END
BEGIN NOW Thee homage, and acknowledge thee their Lord. END
BEGIN NOW What doubt'st thou, Son of God? Sit down and eat. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Jesus temperately replied:-- END
BEGIN NOW Said'st thou not that to all things I had right? END
BEGIN NOW And who withholds my power that right to use? END
BEGIN NOW Shall I receive by gift what of my own, END
BEGIN NOW When and where likes me best, I can command? END
BEGIN NOW I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou, END
BEGIN NOW Command a table in this wilderness, END
BEGIN NOW And call swift flights of Angels ministrant, END
BEGIN NOW Arrayed in glory, on my cup to attend: END
BEGIN NOW Why shouldst thou, then, obtrude this diligence END
BEGIN NOW In vain, where no acceptance it can find? END
BEGIN NOW And with my hunger what hast thou to do? END
BEGIN NOW Thy pompous delicacies I contemn, END
BEGIN NOW And count thy specious gifts no gifts, but guiles. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus answered Satan, male-content:-- END
BEGIN NOW That I have also power to give thou seest; END
BEGIN NOW If of that power I bring thee voluntary END
BEGIN NOW What I might have bestowed on whom I pleased, END
BEGIN NOW And rather opportunely in this place END
BEGIN NOW Chose to impart to thy apparent need, END
BEGIN NOW Why shouldst thou not accept it? But I see END
BEGIN NOW What I can do or offer is suspect. END
BEGIN NOW Of these things others quickly will dispose, END
BEGIN NOW Whose pains have earned the far-fet spoil." With that END
BEGIN NOW Both table and provision vanished quite, END
BEGIN NOW With sound of harpies' wings and talons heard; END
BEGIN NOW Only the importune Tempter still remained, END
BEGIN NOW And with these words his temptation pursued:-- END
BEGIN NOW By hunger, that each other creature tames, END
BEGIN NOW Thou art not to be harmed, therefore not moved; END
BEGIN NOW Thy temperance, invincible besides, END
BEGIN NOW For no allurement yields to appetite; END
BEGIN NOW And all thy heart is set on high designs, END
BEGIN NOW High actions. But wherewith to be achieved? END
BEGIN NOW Great acts require great means of enterprise; END
BEGIN NOW Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth, END
BEGIN NOW A carpenter thy father known, thyself END
BEGIN NOW Bred up in poverty and straits at home, END
BEGIN NOW Lost in a desert here and hunger-bit. END
BEGIN NOW Which way, or from what hope, dost thou aspire END
BEGIN NOW To greatness? whence authority deriv'st? END
BEGIN NOW What followers, what retinue canst thou gain, END
BEGIN NOW Or at thy heels the dizzy multitude, END
BEGIN NOW Longer than thou canst feed them on thy cost? END
BEGIN NOW Money brings honour, friends, conquest, and realms. END
BEGIN NOW What raised Antipater the Edomite, END
BEGIN NOW And his son Herod placed on Juda's throne, END
BEGIN NOW Thy throne, but gold, that got him puissant friends? END
BEGIN NOW Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive, END
BEGIN NOW Get riches first, get wealth, and treasure heap-- END
BEGIN NOW Not difficult, if thou hearken to me. END
BEGIN NOW Riches are mine, fortune is in my hand; END
BEGIN NOW They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain, END
BEGIN NOW While virtue, valour, wisdom, sit in want. END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Jesus patiently replied:-- END
BEGIN NOW Yet wealth without these three is impotent END
BEGIN NOW To gain dominion, or to keep it gained-- END
BEGIN NOW Witness those ancient empires of the earth, END
BEGIN NOW In highth of all their flowing wealth dissolved; END
BEGIN NOW But men endued with these have oft attained, END
BEGIN NOW In lowest poverty, to highest deeds-- END
BEGIN NOW Gideon, and Jephtha, and the shepherd lad END
BEGIN NOW Whose offspring on the throne of Juda sate END
BEGIN NOW So many ages, and shall yet regain END
BEGIN NOW That seat, and reign in Israel without end. END
BEGIN NOW Among the Heathen (for throughout the world END
BEGIN NOW To me is not unknown what hath been done END
BEGIN NOW Worthy of memorial) canst thou not remember END
BEGIN NOW For I esteem those names of men so poor, END
BEGIN NOW Who could do mighty things, and could contemn END
BEGIN NOW Riches, though offered from the hand of kings. END
BEGIN NOW And what in me seems wanting but that I END
BEGIN NOW May also in this poverty as soon END
BEGIN NOW Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more? END
BEGIN NOW Extol not riches, then, the toil of fools, END
BEGIN NOW The wise man's cumbrance, if not snare; more apt END
BEGIN NOW To slacken virtue and abate her edge END
BEGIN NOW Than prompt her to do aught may merit praise. END
BEGIN NOW What if with like aversion I reject END
BEGIN NOW Riches and realms! Yet not for that a crown, END
BEGIN NOW Golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns, END
BEGIN NOW Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights, END
BEGIN NOW To him who wears the regal diadem, END
BEGIN NOW When on his shoulders each man's burden lies; END
BEGIN NOW For therein stands the office of a king, END
BEGIN NOW His honour, virtue, merit, and chief praise, END
BEGIN NOW That for the public all this weight he bears. END
BEGIN NOW Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules END
BEGIN NOW Passions, desires, and fears, is more a king-- END
BEGIN NOW Which every wise and virtuous man attains; END
BEGIN NOW And who attains not, ill aspires to rule END
BEGIN NOW Cities of men, or headstrong multitudes, END
BEGIN NOW Subject himself to anarchy within, END
BEGIN NOW Or lawless passions in him, which he serves. END
BEGIN NOW But to guide nations in the way of truth END
BEGIN NOW By saving doctrine, and from error lead END
BEGIN NOW To know, and, knowing, worship God aright, END
BEGIN NOW Is yet more kingly. This attracts the soul, END
BEGIN NOW Governs the inner man, the nobler part; END
BEGIN NOW That other o'er the body only reigns, END
BEGIN NOW And oft by force--which to a generous mind END
BEGIN NOW So reigning can be no sincere delight. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, to give a kingdom hath been thought END
BEGIN NOW Greater and nobler done, and to lay down END
BEGIN NOW Far more magnanimous, than to assume. END
BEGIN NOW Riches are needless, then, both for themselves, END
BEGIN NOW And for thy reason why they should be sought-- END
BEGIN NOW To gain a sceptre, oftest better missed. END
BEGIN NOW SO spake the Son of God; and Satan stood END
BEGIN NOW A while as mute, confounded what to say, END
BEGIN NOW What to reply, confuted and convinced END
BEGIN NOW Of his weak arguing and fallacious drift; END
BEGIN NOW At length, collecting all his serpent wiles, END
BEGIN NOW With soothing words renewed, him thus accosts:-- END
BEGIN NOW I see thou know'st what is of use to know, END
BEGIN NOW What best to say canst say, to do canst do; END
BEGIN NOW Thy actions to thy words accord; thy words END
BEGIN NOW To thy large heart give utterance due; thy heart END
BEGIN NOW Contains of good, wise, just, the perfet shape. END
BEGIN NOW Should kings and nations from thy mouth consult, END
BEGIN NOW Thy counsel would be as the oracle END
BEGIN NOW Urim and Thummim, those oraculous gems END
BEGIN NOW On Aaron's breast, or tongue of Seers old END
BEGIN NOW Infallible; or, wert thou sought to deeds END
BEGIN NOW That might require the array of war, thy skill END
BEGIN NOW Of conduct would be such that all the world END
BEGIN NOW Could not sustain thy prowess, or subsist END
BEGIN NOW In battle, though against thy few in arms. END
BEGIN NOW These godlike virtues wherefore dost thou hide? END
BEGIN NOW Affecting private life, or more obscure END
BEGIN NOW In savage wilderness, wherefore deprive END
BEGIN NOW All Earth her wonder at thy acts, thyself END
BEGIN NOW The fame and glory--glory, the reward END
BEGIN NOW That sole excites to high attempts the flame END
BEGIN NOW Of most erected spirits, most tempered pure END
BEGIN NOW AEthereal, who all pleasures else despise, END
BEGIN NOW All treasures and all gain esteem as dross, END
BEGIN NOW And dignities and powers, all but the highest? END
BEGIN NOW Thy years are ripe, and over-ripe. The son END
BEGIN NOW Of Macedonian Philip had ere these END
BEGIN NOW Won Asia, and the throne of Cyrus held END
BEGIN NOW At his dispose; young Scipio had brought down END
BEGIN NOW The Carthaginian pride; young Pompey quelled END
BEGIN NOW The Pontic king, and in triumph had rode. END
BEGIN NOW Yet years, and to ripe years judgment mature, END
BEGIN NOW Quench not the thirst of glory, but augment. END
BEGIN NOW Great Julius, whom now all the world admires, END
BEGIN NOW The more he grew in years, the more inflamed END
BEGIN NOW With glory, wept that he had lived so long END
BEGIN NOW Ingloroious. But thou yet art not too late. END
BEGIN NOW To whom our Saviour calmly thus replied:-- END
BEGIN NOW Thou neither dost persuade me to seek wealth END
BEGIN NOW For empire's sake, nor empire to affect END
BEGIN NOW For glory's sake, by all thy argument. END
BEGIN NOW For what is glory but the blaze of fame, END
BEGIN NOW The people's praise, if always praise unmixed? END
BEGIN NOW And what the people but a herd confused, END
BEGIN NOW A miscellaneous rabble, who extol END
BEGIN NOW Things vulgar, and, well weighed, scarce worth the praise? END
BEGIN NOW They praise and they admire they know not what, END
BEGIN NOW And know not whom, but as one leads the other; END
BEGIN NOW And what delight to be by such extolled, END
BEGIN NOW To live upon their tongues, and be their talk? END
BEGIN NOW Of whom to be dispraised were no small praise-- END
BEGIN NOW His lot who dares be singularly good. END
BEGIN NOW The intelligent among them and the wise END
BEGIN NOW Are few, and glory scarce of few is raised. END
BEGIN NOW This is true glory and renown--when God, END
BEGIN NOW Looking on the Earth, with approbation marks END
BEGIN NOW The just man, and divulges him through Heaven END
BEGIN NOW To all his Angels, who with true applause END
BEGIN NOW Recount his praises. Thus he did to Job, END
BEGIN NOW When, to extend his fame through Heaven and Earth, END
BEGIN NOW As thou to thy reproach may'st well remember, END
BEGIN NOW He asked thee, 'Hast thou seen my servant Job?' END
BEGIN NOW Famous he was in Heaven; on Earth less known, END
BEGIN NOW Where glory is false glory, attributed END
BEGIN NOW To things not glorious, men not worthy of fame. END
BEGIN NOW They err who count it glorious to subdue END
BEGIN NOW By conquest far and wide, to overrun END
BEGIN NOW Large countries, and in field great battles win, END
BEGIN NOW Great cities by assault. What do these worthies END
BEGIN NOW But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave END
BEGIN NOW Peaceable nations, neighbouring or remote, END
BEGIN NOW Made captive, yet deserving freedom more END
BEGIN NOW Than those their conquerors, who leave behind END
BEGIN NOW Nothing but ruin wheresoe'er they rove, END
BEGIN NOW And all the flourishing works of peace destroy; END
BEGIN NOW Then swell with pride, and must be titled Gods, END
BEGIN NOW Great benefactors of mankind, Deliverers, END
BEGIN NOW Worshipped with temple, priest, and sacrifice? END
BEGIN NOW One is the son of Jove, of Mars the other; END
BEGIN NOW Till conqueror Death discover them scarce men, END
BEGIN NOW Rowling in brutish vices, and deformed, END
BEGIN NOW Violent or shameful death their due reward. END
BEGIN NOW But, if there be in glory aught of good; END
BEGIN NOW It may be means far different be attained, END
BEGIN NOW Without ambition, war, or violence-- END
BEGIN NOW By deeds of peace, by wisdom eminent, END
BEGIN NOW By patience, temperance. I mention still END
BEGIN NOW Him whom thy wrongs, with saintly patience borne, END
BEGIN NOW Made famous in a land and times obscure; END
BEGIN NOW Who names not now with honour patient Job? END
BEGIN NOW Poor Socrates, (who next more memorable?) END
BEGIN NOW By what he taught and suffered for so doing, END
BEGIN NOW For truth's sake suffering death unjust, lives now END
BEGIN NOW Equal in fame to proudest conquerors. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, if for fame and glory aught be done, END
BEGIN NOW Aught suffered--if young African for fame END
BEGIN NOW His wasted country freed from Punic rage-- END
BEGIN NOW The deed becomes unpraised, the man at least, END
BEGIN NOW And loses, though but verbal, his reward. END
BEGIN NOW Shall I seek glory, then, as vain men seek, END
BEGIN NOW Oft not deserved? I seek not mine, but His END
BEGIN NOW Who sent me, and thereby witness whence I am. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Tempter, murmuring, thus replied:-- END
BEGIN NOW Think not so slight of glory, therein least END
BEGIN NOW Resembling thy great Father. He seeks glory, END
BEGIN NOW And for his glory all things made, all things END
BEGIN NOW Orders and governs; nor content in Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW By all his Angels glorified, requires END
BEGIN NOW Glory from men, from all men, good or bad, END
BEGIN NOW Wise or unwise, no difference, no exemption. END
BEGIN NOW Above all sacrifice, or hallowed gift, END
BEGIN NOW Glory he requires, and glory he receives, END
BEGIN NOW Or Barbarous, nor exception hath declared; END
BEGIN NOW From us, his foes pronounced, glory he exacts. END
BEGIN NOW To whom our Saviour fervently replied: END
BEGIN NOW And reason; since his Word all things produced, END
BEGIN NOW Though chiefly not for glory as prime end, END
BEGIN NOW But to shew forth his goodness, and impart END
BEGIN NOW His good communicable to every soul END
BEGIN NOW Freely; of whom what could He less expect END
BEGIN NOW Than glory and benediction--that is, thanks-- END
BEGIN NOW The slightest, easiest, readiest recompense END
BEGIN NOW From them who could return him nothing else, END
BEGIN NOW And, not returning that, would likeliest render END
BEGIN NOW Contempt instead, dishonour, obloquy? END
BEGIN NOW Hard recompense, unsuitable return END
BEGIN NOW For so much good, so much beneficience! END
BEGIN NOW But why should man seek glory, who of his own END
BEGIN NOW Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs END
BEGIN NOW But condemnation, ignominy, and shame-- END
BEGIN NOW Who, for so many benefits received, END
BEGIN NOW Turned recreant to God, ingrate and false, END
BEGIN NOW And so of all true good himself despoiled; END
BEGIN NOW Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take END
BEGIN NOW That which to God alone of right belongs? END
BEGIN NOW Yet so much bounty is in God, such grace, END
BEGIN NOW That who advances his glory, not their own, END
BEGIN NOW Them he himself to glory will advance. END
BEGIN NOW So spake the Son of God; and here again END
BEGIN NOW Satan had not to answer, but stood struck END
BEGIN NOW With guilt of his own sin--for he himself, END
BEGIN NOW Insatiable of glory, had lost all; END
BEGIN NOW Yet of another plea bethought him soon:-- END
BEGIN NOW Of glory, as thou wilt," said he, "so deem; END
BEGIN NOW Worth or not worth the seeking, let it pass. END
BEGIN NOW But to a Kingdom thou art born--ordained END
BEGIN NOW To sit upon thy father David's throne, END
BEGIN NOW By mother's side thy father, though thy right END
BEGIN NOW Be now in powerful hands, that will not part END
BEGIN NOW Easily from possession won with arms. END
BEGIN NOW Reduced a province under Roman yoke, END
BEGIN NOW Obeys Tiberius, nor is always ruled END
BEGIN NOW With temperate sway: oft have they violated END
BEGIN NOW The Temple, oft the Law, with foul affronts, END
BEGIN NOW Abominations rather, as did once END
BEGIN NOW Antiochus. And think'st thou to regain END
BEGIN NOW Thy right by sitting still, or thus retiring? END
BEGIN NOW So did not Machabeus. He indeed END
BEGIN NOW Retired unto the Desert, but with arms; END
BEGIN NOW And o'er a mighty king so oft prevailed END
BEGIN NOW That by strong hand his family obtained, END
BEGIN NOW Though priests, the crown, and David's throne usurped, END
BEGIN NOW With Modin and her suburbs once content. END
BEGIN NOW If kingdom move thee not, let move thee zeal END
BEGIN NOW And duty--zeal and duty are not slow, END
BEGIN NOW But on Occasion's forelock watchful wait: END
BEGIN NOW They themselves rather are occasion best-- END
BEGIN NOW Zeal of thy Father's house, duty to free END
BEGIN NOW Thy country from her heathen servitude. END
BEGIN NOW So shalt thou best fulfil, best verify, END
BEGIN NOW The Prophets old, who sung thy endless reign-- END
BEGIN NOW The happier reign the sooner it begins. END
BEGIN NOW Rein then; what canst thou better do the while? END
BEGIN NOW To whom our Saviour answer thus returned:-- END
BEGIN NOW All things are best fulfilled in their due time; END
BEGIN NOW And time there is for all things, Truth hath said. END
BEGIN NOW If of my reign Prophetic Writ hath told END
BEGIN NOW That it shall never end, so, when begin END
BEGIN NOW The Father in his purpose hath decreed-- END
BEGIN NOW He in whose hand all times and seasons rowl. END
BEGIN NOW What if he hath decreed that I shall first END
BEGIN NOW Be tried in humble state, and things adverse, END
BEGIN NOW By tribulations, injuries, insults, END
BEGIN NOW Contempts, and scorns, and snares, and violence, END
BEGIN NOW Suffering, abstaining, quietly expecting END
BEGIN NOW Without distrust or doubt, that He may know END
BEGIN NOW What I can suffer, how obey? Who best END
BEGIN NOW Can suffer best can do, best reign who first END
BEGIN NOW Well hath obeyed--just trial ere I merit END
BEGIN NOW My exaltation without change or end. END
BEGIN NOW But what concerns it thee when I begin END
BEGIN NOW My everlasting Kingdom? Why art thou END
BEGIN NOW Solicitous? What moves thy inquisition? END
BEGIN NOW Know'st thou not that my rising is thy fall, END
BEGIN NOW And my promotion will be thy destruction? END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Tempter, inly racked, replied:-- END
BEGIN NOW Let that come when it comes. All hope is lost END
BEGIN NOW Of my reception into grace; what worse? END
BEGIN NOW For where no hope is left is left no fear. END
BEGIN NOW If there be worse, the expectation more END
BEGIN NOW Of worse torments me than the feeling can. END
BEGIN NOW I would be at the worst; worst is my port, END
BEGIN NOW My harbour, and my ultimate repose, END
BEGIN NOW The end I would attain, my final good. END
BEGIN NOW My error was my error, and my crime END
BEGIN NOW My crime; whatever, for itself condemned, END
BEGIN NOW And will alike be punished, whether thou END
BEGIN NOW Reign or reign not--though to that gentle brow END
BEGIN NOW Willingly I could fly, and hope thy reign, END
BEGIN NOW From that placid aspect and meek regard, END
BEGIN NOW Rather than aggravate my evil state, END
BEGIN NOW Would stand between me and thy Father's ire END
BEGIN NOW (Whose ire I dread more than the fire of Hell) END
BEGIN NOW A shelter and a kind of shading cool END
BEGIN NOW Interposition, as a summer's cloud. END
BEGIN NOW If I, then, to the worst that can be haste, END
BEGIN NOW Why move thy feet so slow to what is best? END
BEGIN NOW Happiest, both to thyself and all the world, END
BEGIN NOW That thou, who worthiest art, shouldst be their King! END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps thou linger'st in deep thoughts detained END
BEGIN NOW Of the enterprise so hazardous and high! END
BEGIN NOW No wonder; for, though in thee be united END
BEGIN NOW What of perfection can in Man be found, END
BEGIN NOW Or human nature can receive, consider END
BEGIN NOW Thy life hath yet been private, most part spent END
BEGIN NOW At home, scarce viewed the Galilean towns, END
BEGIN NOW And once a year Jerusalem, few days' END
BEGIN NOW Short sojourn; and what thence couldst thou observe? END
BEGIN NOW The world thou hast not seen, much less her glory, END
BEGIN NOW Empires, and monarchs, and their radiant courts-- END
BEGIN NOW Best school of best experience, quickest in sight END
BEGIN NOW In all things that to greatest actions lead. END
BEGIN NOW The wisest, unexperienced, will be ever END
BEGIN NOW Timorous, and loth, with novice modesty END
BEGIN NOW (As he who, seeking asses, found a kingdom) END
BEGIN NOW Irresolute, unhardy, unadventrous. END
BEGIN NOW But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit END
BEGIN NOW Those rudiments, and see before thine eyes END
BEGIN NOW The monarchies of the Earth, their pomp and state-- END
BEGIN NOW Sufficient introduction to inform END
BEGIN NOW Thee, of thyself so apt, in regal arts, END
BEGIN NOW And regal mysteries; that thou may'st know END
BEGIN NOW How best their opposition to withstand. END
BEGIN NOW With that (such power was given him then), he took END
BEGIN NOW The Son of God up to a mountain high. END
BEGIN NOW It was a mountain at whose verdant feet END
BEGIN NOW A spacious plain outstretched in circuit wide END
BEGIN NOW Lay pleasant; from his side two rivers flowed, END
BEGIN NOW The one winding, the other straight, and left between END
BEGIN NOW Fair champaign, with less rivers interveined, END
BEGIN NOW Then meeting joined their tribute to the sea. END
BEGIN NOW Fertil of corn the glebe, of oil, and wine; END
BEGIN NOW With herds the pasture thronged, with flocks the hills; END
BEGIN NOW Huge cities and high-towered, that well might seem END
BEGIN NOW The seats of mightiest monarchs; and so large END
BEGIN NOW The prospect was that here and there was room END
BEGIN NOW For barren desert, fountainless and dry. END
BEGIN NOW To this high mountain-top the Tempter brought END
BEGIN NOW Our Saviour, and new train of words began:-- END
BEGIN NOW Well have we speeded, and o'er hill and dale, END
BEGIN NOW Forest, and field, and flood, temples and towers, END
BEGIN NOW Cut shorter many a league. Here thou behold'st END
BEGIN NOW Assyria, and her empire's ancient bounds, END
BEGIN NOW Araxes and the Caspian lake; thence on END
BEGIN NOW As far as Indus east, Euphrates west, END
BEGIN NOW And oft beyond; to south the Persian bay, END
BEGIN NOW And, inaccessible, the Arabian drouth: END
BEGIN NOW Here, Nineveh, of length within her wall END
BEGIN NOW Several days' journey, built by Ninus old, END
BEGIN NOW Of that first golden monarchy the seat, END
BEGIN NOW And seat of Salmanassar, whose success END
BEGIN NOW Israel in long captivity still mourns; END
BEGIN NOW There Babylon, the wonder of all tongues, END
BEGIN NOW As ancient, but rebuilt by him who twice END
BEGIN NOW Judah and all thy father David's house END
BEGIN NOW Led captive, and Jerusalem laid waste, END
BEGIN NOW Till Cyrus set them free; Persepolis, END
BEGIN NOW His city, there thou seest, and Bactra there; END
BEGIN NOW Ecbatana her structure vast there shews, END
BEGIN NOW And Hecatompylos her hunderd gates; END
BEGIN NOW There Susa by Choaspes, amber stream, END
BEGIN NOW The drink of none but kings; of later fame, END
BEGIN NOW Built by Emathian or by Parthian hands, END
BEGIN NOW The great Seleucia, Nisibis, and there END
BEGIN NOW Turning with easy eye, thou may'st behold. END
BEGIN NOW All these the Parthian (now some ages past END
BEGIN NOW By great Arsaces led, who founded first END
BEGIN NOW That empire) under his dominion holds, END
BEGIN NOW From the luxurious kings of Antioch won. END
BEGIN NOW And just in time thou com'st to have a view END
BEGIN NOW Of his great power; for now the Parthian king END
BEGIN NOW In Ctesiphon hath gathered all his host END
BEGIN NOW Against the Scythian, whose incursions wild END
BEGIN NOW Have wasted Sogdiana; to her aid END
BEGIN NOW He marches now in haste. See, though from far, END
BEGIN NOW His thousands, in what martial equipage END
BEGIN NOW They issue forth, steel bows and shafts their arms, END
BEGIN NOW Of equal dread in flight or in pursuit-- END
BEGIN NOW All horsemen, in which fight they most excel; END
BEGIN NOW See how in warlike muster they appear, END
BEGIN NOW In rhombs, and wedges, and half-moons, and wings. END
BEGIN NOW He looked, and saw what numbers numberless END
BEGIN NOW The city gates outpoured, light-armed troops END
BEGIN NOW In coats of mail and military pride. END
BEGIN NOW In mail their horses clad, yet fleet and strong, END
BEGIN NOW Prauncing their riders bore, the flower and choice END
BEGIN NOW Of many provinces from bound to bound-- END
BEGIN NOW From Arachosia, from Candaor east, END
BEGIN NOW And Margiana, to the Hyrcanian cliffs END
BEGIN NOW Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales; END
BEGIN NOW From Atropatia, and the neighbouring plains END
BEGIN NOW Of Adiabene, Media, and the south END
BEGIN NOW Of Susiana, to Balsara's haven. END
BEGIN NOW He saw them in their forms of battle ranged, END
BEGIN NOW How quick they wheeled, and flying behind them shot END
BEGIN NOW Sharp sleet of arrowy showers against the face END
BEGIN NOW Of their pursuers, and overcame by flight; END
BEGIN NOW The field all iron cast a gleaming brown. END
BEGIN NOW Nor wanted clouds of foot, nor, on each horn, END
BEGIN NOW Cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight, END
BEGIN NOW Chariots, or elephants indorsed with towers END
BEGIN NOW Of archers; nor of labouring pioners END
BEGIN NOW To lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys fill, END
BEGIN NOW Or where plain was raise hill, or overlay END
BEGIN NOW With bridges rivers proud, as with a yoke: END
BEGIN NOW Mules after these, camels and dromedaries, END
BEGIN NOW And waggons fraught with utensils of war. END
BEGIN NOW Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp, END
BEGIN NOW When Agrican, with all his northern powers, END
BEGIN NOW Besieged Albracea, as romances tell, END
BEGIN NOW The city of Gallaphrone, from thence to win END
BEGIN NOW The fairest of her sex, Angelica, END
BEGIN NOW His daughter, sought by many prowest knights, END
BEGIN NOW Both Paynim and the peers of Charlemane. END
BEGIN NOW Such and so numerous was their chivalry; END
BEGIN NOW At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presumed, END
BEGIN NOW And to our Saviour thus his words renewed:-- END
BEGIN NOW That thou may'st know I seek not to engage END
BEGIN NOW Thy virtue, and not every way secure END
BEGIN NOW On no slight grounds thy safety, hear and mark END
BEGIN NOW To what end I have brought thee hither, and shew END
BEGIN NOW All this fair sight. Thy kingdom, though foretold END
BEGIN NOW By Prophet or by Angel, unless thou END
BEGIN NOW Endeavour, as thy father David did, END
BEGIN NOW Thou never shalt obtain: prediction still END
BEGIN NOW In all things, and all men, supposes means; END
BEGIN NOW Without means used, what it predicts revokes. END
BEGIN NOW But say thou wert possessed of David's throne END
BEGIN NOW By free consent of all, none opposite, END
BEGIN NOW Long to enjoy it quiet and secure END
BEGIN NOW Between two such enclosing enemies, END
BEGIN NOW Roman and Parthian? Therefore one of these END
BEGIN NOW Thou must make sure thy own: the Parthian first, END
BEGIN NOW By my advice, as nearer, and of late END
BEGIN NOW Found able by invasion to annoy END
BEGIN NOW Thy country, and captive lead away her kings, END
BEGIN NOW Antigonus and old Hyrcanus, bound, END
BEGIN NOW Maugre the Roman. It shall be my task END
BEGIN NOW To render thee the Parthian at dispose, END
BEGIN NOW Choose which thou wilt, by conquest or by league. END
BEGIN NOW By him thou shalt regain, without him not, END
BEGIN NOW That which alone can truly reinstall thee END
BEGIN NOW In David's royal seat, his true successor-- END
BEGIN NOW Deliverance of thy brethren, those Ten Tribes END
BEGIN NOW Whose offspring in his territory yet serve END
BEGIN NOW In Habor, and among the Medes dispersed: END
BEGIN NOW The sons of Jacob, two of Joseph, lost END
BEGIN NOW Thus long from Israel, serving, as of old END
BEGIN NOW This offer sets before thee to deliver. END
BEGIN NOW These if from servitude thou shalt restore END
BEGIN NOW To their inheritance, then, nor till then, END
BEGIN NOW Thou on the throne of David in full glory, END
BEGIN NOW Shalt reign, and Rome or Caesar not need fear. END
BEGIN NOW To whom our Saviour answered thus, unmoved:-- END
BEGIN NOW Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm END
BEGIN NOW And fragile arms, much instrument of war, END
BEGIN NOW Long in preparing, soon to nothing brought, END
BEGIN NOW Before mine eyes thou hast set, and in my ear END
BEGIN NOW Vented much policy, and projects deep END
BEGIN NOW Of enemies, of aids, battles, and leagues, END
BEGIN NOW Plausible to the world, to me worth naught. END
BEGIN NOW Means I must use, thou say'st; prediction else END
BEGIN NOW Will unpredict, and fail me of the throne! END
BEGIN NOW My time, I told thee (and that time for thee END
BEGIN NOW Were better farthest off), is not yet come. END
BEGIN NOW When that comes, think not thou to find me slack END
BEGIN NOW On my part aught endeavouring, or to need END
BEGIN NOW Thy politic maxims, or that cumbersome END
BEGIN NOW Luggage of war there shewn me--argument END
BEGIN NOW Of human weakness rather than of strength. END
BEGIN NOW My brethren, as thou call'st them, those Ten Tribes, END
BEGIN NOW I must deliver, if I mean to reign END
BEGIN NOW David's true heir, and his full sceptre sway END
BEGIN NOW To just extent over all Israel's sons! END
BEGIN NOW But whence to thee this zeal? Where was it then END
BEGIN NOW For Israel, or for David, or his throne, END
BEGIN NOW When thou stood'st up his tempter to the pride END
BEGIN NOW Of numbering Israel--which cost the lives END
BEGIN NOW of threescore and ten thousand Israelites END
BEGIN NOW By three days' pestilence? Such was thy zeal END
BEGIN NOW To Israel then, the same that now to me. END
BEGIN NOW As for those captive tribes, themselves were they END
BEGIN NOW Who wrought their own captivity, fell off END
BEGIN NOW From God to worship calves, the deities END
BEGIN NOW And all the idolatries of heathen round, END
BEGIN NOW Besides their other worse than heathenish crimes; END
BEGIN NOW Nor in the land of their captivity END
BEGIN NOW Humbled themselves, or penitent besought END
BEGIN NOW The God of their forefathers, but so died END
BEGIN NOW Impenitent, and left a race behind END
BEGIN NOW Like to themselves, distinguishable scarce END
BEGIN NOW From Gentiles, but by circumcision vain, END
BEGIN NOW And God with idols in their worship joined. END
BEGIN NOW Should I of these the liberty regard, END
BEGIN NOW Who, freed, as to their ancient patrimony, END
BEGIN NOW Unhumbled, unrepentant, unreformed, END
BEGIN NOW Headlong would follow, and to their gods perhaps END
BEGIN NOW Of Bethel and of Dan? No; let them serve END
BEGIN NOW Their enemies who serve idols with God. END
BEGIN NOW Yet He at length, time to himself best known, END
BEGIN NOW Remembering Abraham, by some wondrous call END
BEGIN NOW May bring them back, repentant and sincere, END
BEGIN NOW And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood, END
BEGIN NOW While to their native land with joy they haste, END
BEGIN NOW As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft, END
BEGIN NOW When to the Promised Land their fathers passed. END
BEGIN NOW To his due time and providence I leave them. END
BEGIN NOW So spake Israel's true King, and to the Fiend END
BEGIN NOW Made answer meet, that made void all his wiles. END
BEGIN NOW So fares it when with truth falsehood contends. END
BEGIN NOW Perplexed and troubled at his bad success END
BEGIN NOW The Tempter stood, nor had what to reply, END
BEGIN NOW Discovered in his fraud, thrown from his hope END
BEGIN NOW So oft, and the persuasive rhetoric END
BEGIN NOW That sleeked his tongue, and won so much on Eve, END
BEGIN NOW So little here, nay lost. But Eve was Eve; END
BEGIN NOW This far his over-match, who, self-deceived END
BEGIN NOW And rash, beforehand had no better weighed END
BEGIN NOW The strength he was to cope with, or his own. END
BEGIN NOW But--as a man who had been matchless held END
BEGIN NOW In cunning, over-reached where least he thought, END
BEGIN NOW To salve his credit, and for very spite, END
BEGIN NOW Still will be tempting him who foils him still, END
BEGIN NOW And never cease, though to his shame the more; END
BEGIN NOW Or as a swarm of flies in vintage-time, END
BEGIN NOW About the wine-press where sweet must is poured, END
BEGIN NOW Beat off, returns as oft with humming sound; END
BEGIN NOW Or surging waves against a solid rock, END
BEGIN NOW Though all to shivers dashed, the assault renew, END
BEGIN NOW (Vain battery!) and in froth or bubbles end-- END
BEGIN NOW So Satan, whom repulse upon repulse END
BEGIN NOW Met ever, and to shameful silence brought, END
BEGIN NOW Yet gives not o'er, though desperate of success, END
BEGIN NOW And his vain importunity pursues. END
BEGIN NOW He brought our Saviour to the western side END
BEGIN NOW Of that high mountain, whence he might behold END
BEGIN NOW Another plain, long, but in breadth not wide, END
BEGIN NOW Washed by the southern sea, and on the north END
BEGIN NOW To equal length backed with a ridge of hills END
BEGIN NOW That screened the fruits of the earth and seats of men END
BEGIN NOW From cold Septentrion blasts; thence in the midst END
BEGIN NOW Divided by a river, off whose banks END
BEGIN NOW On each side an Imperial City stood, END
BEGIN NOW With towers and temples proudly elevate END
BEGIN NOW On seven small hills, with palaces adorned, END
BEGIN NOW Porches and theatres, baths, aqueducts, END
BEGIN NOW Statues and trophies, and triumphal arcs, END
BEGIN NOW Gardens and groves, presented to his eyes END
BEGIN NOW Above the highth of mountains interposed-- END
BEGIN NOW By what strange parallax, or optic skill END
BEGIN NOW Of vision, multiplied through air, or glass END
BEGIN NOW Of telescope, were curious to enquire. END
BEGIN NOW And now the Tempter thus his silence broke:-- END
BEGIN NOW The city which thou seest no other deem END
BEGIN NOW Than great and glorious Rome, Queen of the Earth END
BEGIN NOW So far renowned, and with the spoils enriched END
BEGIN NOW Of nations. There the Capitol thou seest, END
BEGIN NOW Above the rest lifting his stately head END
BEGIN NOW On the Tarpeian rock, her citadel END
BEGIN NOW Impregnable; and there Mount Palatine, END
BEGIN NOW The imperial palace, compass huge, and high END
BEGIN NOW The structure, skill of noblest architects, END
BEGIN NOW With gilded battlements, conspicuous far, END
BEGIN NOW Turrets, and terraces, and glittering spires. END
BEGIN NOW Many a fair edifice besides, more like END
BEGIN NOW Houses of gods--so well I have disposed END
BEGIN NOW My aerie microscope--thou may'st behold, END
BEGIN NOW Outside and inside both, pillars and roofs END
BEGIN NOW Carved work, the hand of famed artificers END
BEGIN NOW In cedar, marble, ivory, or gold. END
BEGIN NOW Thence to the gates cast round thine eye, and see END
BEGIN NOW What conflux issuing forth, or entering in: END
BEGIN NOW Praetors, proconsuls to their provinces END
BEGIN NOW Hasting, or on return, in robes of state; END
BEGIN NOW Lictors and rods, the ensigns of their power; END
BEGIN NOW Legions and cohorts, turms of horse and wings; END
BEGIN NOW Or embassies from regions far remote, END
BEGIN NOW In various habits, on the Appian road, END
BEGIN NOW Or on the AEmilian--some from farthest south, END
BEGIN NOW Syene, and where the shadow both way falls, END
BEGIN NOW Meroe, Nilotic isle, and, more to west, END
BEGIN NOW The realm of Bocchus to the Blackmoor sea; END
BEGIN NOW From the Asian kings (and Parthian among these), END
BEGIN NOW And utmost Indian isle Taprobane, END
BEGIN NOW Dusk faces with white silken turbants wreathed; END
BEGIN NOW From Gallia, Gades, and the British west; END
BEGIN NOW Germans, and Scythians, and Sarmatians north END
BEGIN NOW Beyond Danubius to the Tauric pool. END
BEGIN NOW All nations now to Rome obedience pay-- END
BEGIN NOW To Rome's great Emperor, whose wide domain, END
BEGIN NOW In ample territory, wealth and power, END
BEGIN NOW Civility of manners, arts and arms, END
BEGIN NOW And long renown, thou justly may'st prefer END
BEGIN NOW Before the Parthian. These two thrones except, END
BEGIN NOW The rest are barbarous, and scarce worth the sight, END
BEGIN NOW Shared among petty kings too far removed; END
BEGIN NOW These having shewn thee, I have shewn thee all END
BEGIN NOW The kingdoms of the world, and all their glory. END
BEGIN NOW This Emperor hath no son, and now is old, END
BEGIN NOW Old and lascivious, and from Rome retired END
BEGIN NOW To Capreae, an island small but strong END
BEGIN NOW On the Campanian shore, with purpose there END
BEGIN NOW His horrid lusts in private to enjoy; END
BEGIN NOW Committing to a wicked favourite END
BEGIN NOW All public cares, and yet of him suspicious; END
BEGIN NOW Hated of all, and hating. With what ease, END
BEGIN NOW Endued with regal virtues as thou art, END
BEGIN NOW Appearing, and beginning noble deeds, END
BEGIN NOW Might'st thou expel this monster from his throne, END
BEGIN NOW Now made a sty, and, in his place ascending, END
BEGIN NOW A victor-people free from servile yoke! END
BEGIN NOW And with my help thou may'st; to me the power END
BEGIN NOW Is given, and by that right I give it thee. END
BEGIN NOW Aim, therefore, at no less than all the world; END
BEGIN NOW Aim at the highest; without the highest attained, END
BEGIN NOW Will be for thee no sitting, or not long, END
BEGIN NOW On David's throne, be prophesied what will. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Son of God, unmoved, replied:-- END
BEGIN NOW Nor doth this grandeur and majestic shew END
BEGIN NOW Of luxury, though called magnificence, END
BEGIN NOW More than of arms before, allure mine eye, END
BEGIN NOW Much less my mind; though thou should'st add to tell END
BEGIN NOW Their sumptuous gluttonies, and gorgeous feasts END
BEGIN NOW On citron tables or Atlantic stone END
BEGIN NOW (For I have also heard, perhaps have read), END
BEGIN NOW Their wines of Setia, Cales, and Falerne, END
BEGIN NOW Chios and Crete, and how they quaff in gold, END
BEGIN NOW Crystal, and myrrhine cups, imbossed with gems END
BEGIN NOW And studs of pearl--to me should'st tell, who thirst END
BEGIN NOW And hunger still. Then embassies thou shew'st END
BEGIN NOW From nations far and nigh! What honour that, END
BEGIN NOW But tedious waste of time, to sit and hear END
BEGIN NOW So many hollow compliments and lies, END
BEGIN NOW Outlandish flatteries? Then proceed'st to talk END
BEGIN NOW Of the Emperor, how easily subdued, END
BEGIN NOW How gloriously. I shall, thou say'st, expel END
BEGIN NOW A brutish monster: what if I withal END
BEGIN NOW Expel a Devil who first made him such? END
BEGIN NOW Let his tormentor, Conscience, find him out; END
BEGIN NOW For him I was not sent, nor yet to free END
BEGIN NOW That people, victor once, now vile and base, END
BEGIN NOW Deservedly made vassal--who, once just, END
BEGIN NOW Frugal, and mild, and temperate, conquered well, END
BEGIN NOW But govern ill the nations under yoke, END
BEGIN NOW Peeling their provinces, exhausted all END
BEGIN NOW By lust and rapine; first ambitious grown END
BEGIN NOW Of triumph, that insulting vanity; END
BEGIN NOW Then cruel, by their sports to blood inured END
BEGIN NOW Of fighting beasts, and men to beasts exposed; END
BEGIN NOW Luxurious by their wealth, and greedier still, END
BEGIN NOW And from the daily Scene effeminate. END
BEGIN NOW What wise and valiant man would seek to free END
BEGIN NOW These, thus degenerate, by themselves enslaved, END
BEGIN NOW Or could of inward slaves make outward free? END
BEGIN NOW Know, therefore, when my season comes to sit END
BEGIN NOW On David's throne, it shall be like a tree END
BEGIN NOW Spreading and overshadowing all the earth, END
BEGIN NOW Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash END
BEGIN NOW All monarchies besides throughout the world; END
BEGIN NOW And of my Kingdom there shall be no end. END
BEGIN NOW Means there shall be to this; but what the means END
BEGIN NOW Is not for thee to know, nor me to tell. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Tempter, impudent, replied:-- END
BEGIN NOW I see all offers made by me how slight END
BEGIN NOW Thou valuest, because offered, and reject'st. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing will please the difficult and nice, END
BEGIN NOW Or nothing more than still to contradict. END
BEGIN NOW On the other side know also thou that I END
BEGIN NOW On what I offer set as high esteem, END
BEGIN NOW Nor what I part with mean to give for naught, END
BEGIN NOW All these, which in a moment thou behold'st, END
BEGIN NOW The kingdoms of the world, to thee I give END
BEGIN NOW (For, given to me, I give to whom I please), END
BEGIN NOW No trifle; yet with this reserve, not else-- END
BEGIN NOW On this condition, if thou wilt fall down, END
BEGIN NOW And worship me as thy superior Lord END
BEGIN NOW (Easily done), and hold them all of me; END
BEGIN NOW For what can less so great a gift deserve? END
BEGIN NOW Whom thus our Saviour answered with disdain:-- END
BEGIN NOW I never liked thy talk, thy offers less; END
BEGIN NOW Now both abhor, since thou hast dared to utter END
BEGIN NOW The abominable terms, impious condition. END
BEGIN NOW But I endure the time, till which expired END
BEGIN NOW Thou hast permission on me. It is written, END
BEGIN NOW The first of all commandments, 'Thou shalt worship END
BEGIN NOW The Lord thy God, and only Him shalt serve.' END
BEGIN NOW And dar'st thou to the Son of God propound END
BEGIN NOW To worship thee, accursed? now more accursed END
BEGIN NOW For this attempt, bolder than that on Eve, END
BEGIN NOW And more blasphemous; which expect to rue. END
BEGIN NOW The kingdoms of the world to thee were given! END
BEGIN NOW Permitted rather, and by thee usurped; END
BEGIN NOW Other donation none thou canst produce. END
BEGIN NOW If given, by whom but by the King of kings, END
BEGIN NOW God over all supreme? If given to thee, END
BEGIN NOW By thee how fairly is the Giver now END
BEGIN NOW Repaid! But gratitude in thee is lost END
BEGIN NOW Long since. Wert thou so void of fear or shame END
BEGIN NOW As offer them to me, the Son of God-- END
BEGIN NOW To me my own, on such abhorred pact, END
BEGIN NOW That I fall down and worship thee as God? END
BEGIN NOW Get thee behind me! Plain thou now appear'st END
BEGIN NOW That Evil One, Satan for ever damned. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Fiend, with fear abashed, replied:-- END
BEGIN NOW Be not so sore offended, Son of God-- END
BEGIN NOW Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men-- END
BEGIN NOW If I, to try whether in higher sort END
BEGIN NOW Than these thou bear'st that title, have proposed END
BEGIN NOW What both from Men and Angels I receive, END
BEGIN NOW Nations besides from all the quartered winds-- END
BEGIN NOW God of this World invoked, and World beneath. END
BEGIN NOW Who then thou art, whose coming is foretold END
BEGIN NOW To me most fatal, me it most concerns. END
BEGIN NOW The trial hath indamaged thee no way, END
BEGIN NOW Rather more honour left and more esteem; END
BEGIN NOW Me naught advantaged, missing what I aimed. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore let pass, as they are transitory, END
BEGIN NOW The kingdoms of this world; I shall no more END
BEGIN NOW Advise thee; gain them as thou canst, or not. END
BEGIN NOW And thou thyself seem'st otherwise inclined END
BEGIN NOW Than to a worldly crown, addicted more END
BEGIN NOW To contemplation and profound dispute; END
BEGIN NOW As by that early action may be judged, END
BEGIN NOW When, slipping from thy mother's eye, thou went'st END
BEGIN NOW Alone into the Temple, there wast found END
BEGIN NOW Among the gravest Rabbies, disputant END
BEGIN NOW On points and questions fitting Moses' chair, END
BEGIN NOW Teaching, not taught. The childhood shews the man, END
BEGIN NOW As morning shews the day. Be famous, then, END
BEGIN NOW By wisdom; as thy empire must extend, END
BEGIN NOW So let extend thy mind o'er all the world END
BEGIN NOW In knowledge; all things in it comprehend. END
BEGIN NOW All knowledge is not couched in Moses' law, END
BEGIN NOW The Pentateuch, or what the Prophets wrote; END
BEGIN NOW The Gentiles also know, and write, and teach END
BEGIN NOW To admiration, led by Nature's light; END
BEGIN NOW And with the Gentiles much thou must converse, END
BEGIN NOW Ruling them by persuasion, as thou mean'st. END
BEGIN NOW Without their learning, how wilt thou with them, END
BEGIN NOW Or they with thee, hold conversation meet? END
BEGIN NOW How wilt thou reason with them, how refute END
BEGIN NOW Their idolisms, traditions, paradoxes? END
BEGIN NOW Error by his own arms is best evinced. END
BEGIN NOW Look once more, ere we leave this specular mount, END
BEGIN NOW Westward, much nearer by south-west; behold END
BEGIN NOW Where on the AEgean shore a city stands, END
BEGIN NOW Built nobly, pure the air and light the soil-- END
BEGIN NOW Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts END
BEGIN NOW And Eloquence, native to famous wits END
BEGIN NOW Or hospitable, in her sweet recess, END
BEGIN NOW City or suburban, studious walks and shades. END
BEGIN NOW See there the olive-grove of Academe, END
BEGIN NOW Plato's retirement, where the Attic bird END
BEGIN NOW Trills her thick-warbled notes the summer long; END
BEGIN NOW There, flowery hill, Hymettus, with the sound END
BEGIN NOW Of bees' industrious murmur, oft invites END
BEGIN NOW To studious musing; there Ilissus rowls END
BEGIN NOW His whispering stream. Within the walls then view END
BEGIN NOW The schools of ancient sages--his who bred END
BEGIN NOW Great Alexander to subdue the world, END
BEGIN NOW Lyceum there; and painted Stoa next. END
BEGIN NOW There thou shalt hear and learn the secret power END
BEGIN NOW Of harmony, in tones and numbers hit END
BEGIN NOW By voice or hand, and various-measured verse, END
BEGIN NOW AEolian charms and Dorian lyric odes, END
BEGIN NOW And his who gave them breath, but higher sung, END
BEGIN NOW Blind Melesigenes, thence Homer called, END
BEGIN NOW Whose poem Phoebus challenged for his own. END
BEGIN NOW Thence what the lofty grave Tragedians taught END
BEGIN NOW In chorus or iambic, teachers best END
BEGIN NOW Of moral prudence, with delight received END
BEGIN NOW In brief sententious precepts, while they treat END
BEGIN NOW Of fate, and chance, and change in human life, END
BEGIN NOW High actions and high passions best describing. END
BEGIN NOW Thence to the famous Orators repair, END
BEGIN NOW Those ancient whose resistless eloquence END
BEGIN NOW Wielded at will that fierce democraty, END
BEGIN NOW Shook the Arsenal, and fulmined over Greece END
BEGIN NOW To Macedon and Artaxerxes' throne. END
BEGIN NOW To sage Philosophy next lend thine ear, END
BEGIN NOW From heaven descended to the low-roofed house END
BEGIN NOW Of Socrates--see there his tenement-- END
BEGIN NOW Whom, well inspired, the Oracle pronounced END
BEGIN NOW Wisest of men; from whose mouth issued forth END
BEGIN NOW Mellifluous streams, that watered all the schools END
BEGIN NOW Of Academics old and new, with those END
BEGIN NOW Surnamed Peripatetics, and the sect END
BEGIN NOW Epicurean, and the Stoic severe. END
BEGIN NOW These here revolve, or, as thou likest, at home, END
BEGIN NOW Till time mature thee to a kingdom's weight; END
BEGIN NOW These rules will render thee a king complete END
BEGIN NOW Within thyself, much more with empire joined. END
BEGIN NOW To whom our Saviour sagely thus replied:-- END
BEGIN NOW Think not but that I know these things; or, think END
BEGIN NOW I know them not, not therefore am I short END
BEGIN NOW Of knowing what I ought. He who receives END
BEGIN NOW Light from above, from the Fountain of Light, END
BEGIN NOW No other doctrine needs, though granted true; END
BEGIN NOW But these are false, or little else but dreams, END
BEGIN NOW Conjectures, fancies, built on nothing firm. END
BEGIN NOW The first and wisest of them all professed END
BEGIN NOW To know this only, that he nothing knew; END
BEGIN NOW The next to fabling fell and smooth conceits; END
BEGIN NOW A third sort doubted all things, though plain sense; END
BEGIN NOW Others in virtue placed felicity, END
BEGIN NOW But virtue joined with riches and long life; END
BEGIN NOW In corporal pleasure he, and careless ease; END
BEGIN NOW The Stoic last in philosophic pride, END
BEGIN NOW By him called virtue, and his virtuous man, END
BEGIN NOW Wise, perfect in himself, and all possessing, END
BEGIN NOW Equal to God, oft shames not to prefer, END
BEGIN NOW As fearing God nor man, contemning all END
BEGIN NOW Wealth, pleasure, pain or torment, death and life-- END
BEGIN NOW Which, when he lists, he leaves, or boasts he can; END
BEGIN NOW For all his tedious talk is but vain boast, END
BEGIN NOW Or subtle shifts conviction to evade. END
BEGIN NOW Alas! what can they teach, and not mislead, END
BEGIN NOW Ignorant of themselves, of God much more, END
BEGIN NOW And how the World began, and how Man fell, END
BEGIN NOW Degraded by himself, on grace depending? END
BEGIN NOW Much of the Soul they talk, but all awry; END
BEGIN NOW And in themselves seek virtue; and to themselves END
BEGIN NOW All glory arrogate, to God give none; END
BEGIN NOW Rather accuse him under usual names, END
BEGIN NOW Fortune and Fate, as one regardless quite END
BEGIN NOW Of mortal things. Who, therefore, seeks in these END
BEGIN NOW True wisdom finds her not, or, by delusion END
BEGIN NOW Far worse, her false resemblance only meets, END
BEGIN NOW An empty cloud. However, many books, END
BEGIN NOW Wise men have said, are wearisome; who reads END
BEGIN NOW Incessantly, and to his reading brings not END
BEGIN NOW A spirit and judgment equal or superior, END

BEGIN NOW As in our native language can I find END
BEGIN NOW That solace? All our Law and Story strewed END
BEGIN NOW With hymns, our Psalms with artful terms inscribed, END
BEGIN NOW Our Hebrew songs and harps, in Babylon END

BEGIN NOW What makes a nation happy, and keeps it so, END

BEGIN NOW So spake the Son of God; but Satan, now END
BEGIN NOW Quite at a loss (for all his darts were spent), END
BEGIN NOW Thus to our Saviour, with stern brow, replied:-- END
BEGIN NOW Since neither wealth nor honour, arms nor arts, END
BEGIN NOW Kingdom nor empire, pleases thee, nor aught END
BEGIN NOW By me proposed in life contemplative END
BEGIN NOW Or active, tended on by glory or fame, END
BEGIN NOW What dost thou in this world? The Wilderness END
BEGIN NOW For thee is fittest place: I found thee there, END
BEGIN NOW And thither will return thee. Yet remember END
BEGIN NOW What I foretell thee; soon thou shalt have cause END
BEGIN NOW To wish thou never hadst rejected, thus END
BEGIN NOW Nicely or cautiously, my offered aid, END
BEGIN NOW Which would have set thee in short time with ease END
BEGIN NOW On David's throne, or throne of all the world, END
BEGIN NOW Now at full age, fulness of time, thy season, END
BEGIN NOW When prophecies of thee are best fulfilled. END
BEGIN NOW Now, contrary--if I read aught in heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Or heaven write aught of fate--by what the stars END
BEGIN NOW Voluminous, or single characters END
BEGIN NOW In their conjunction met, give me to spell, END
BEGIN NOW Sorrows and labours, opposition, hate, END
BEGIN NOW Attends thee; scorns, reproaches, injuries, END
BEGIN NOW Violence and stripes, and, lastly, cruel death. END
BEGIN NOW A kingdom they portend thee, but what kingdom, END
BEGIN NOW Real or allegoric, I discern not; END
BEGIN NOW Nor when: eternal sure--as without end, END
BEGIN NOW Without beginning; for no date prefixed END
BEGIN NOW Directs me in the starry rubric set. END
BEGIN NOW So saying, he took (for still he knew his power END
BEGIN NOW Not yet expired), and to the Wilderness END
BEGIN NOW Brought back, the Son of God, and left him there, END
BEGIN NOW Feigning to disappear. Darkness now rose, END
BEGIN NOW As daylight sunk, and brought in louring Night, END
BEGIN NOW Her shadowy offspring, unsubstantial both, END
BEGIN NOW Privation mere of light and absent day. END
BEGIN NOW Our Saviour, meek, and with untroubled mind END
BEGIN NOW After hisaerie jaunt, though hurried sore, END
BEGIN NOW Hungry and cold, betook him to his rest, END
BEGIN NOW Wherever, under some concourse of shades, END
BEGIN NOW Whose branching arms thick intertwined might shield END
BEGIN NOW From dews and damps of night his sheltered head; END
BEGIN NOW But, sheltered, slept in vain; for at his head END
BEGIN NOW The Tempter watched, and soon with ugly dreams END
BEGIN NOW Disturbed his sleep. And either tropic now END
BEGIN NOW 'Gan thunder, and both ends of heaven; the clouds END
BEGIN NOW From many a horrid rift abortive poured END
BEGIN NOW Fierce rain with lightning mixed, water with fire, END
BEGIN NOW In ruin reconciled; nor slept the winds END
BEGIN NOW Within their stony caves, but rushed abroad END
BEGIN NOW From the four hinges of the world, and fell END
BEGIN NOW On the vexed wilderness, whose tallest pines, END
BEGIN NOW Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest oaks, END
BEGIN NOW Bowed their stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts, END
BEGIN NOW Or torn up sheer. Ill wast thou shrouded then, END
BEGIN NOW O patient Son of God, yet only stood'st END
BEGIN NOW Unshaken! Nor yet staid the terror there: END
BEGIN NOW Infernal ghosts and hellish furies round END
BEGIN NOW Environed thee; some howled, some yelled, some shrieked, END
BEGIN NOW Some bent at thee their fiery darts, while thou END
BEGIN NOW Sat'st unappalled in calm and sinless peace. END
BEGIN NOW Thus passed the night so foul, till Morning fair END
BEGIN NOW Came forth with pilgrim steps, in amice grey, END
BEGIN NOW Who with her radiant finger stilled the roar END
BEGIN NOW Of thunder, chased the clouds, and laid the winds, END
BEGIN NOW And griesly spectres, which the Fiend had raised END
BEGIN NOW To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire. END
BEGIN NOW And now the sun with more effectual beams END
BEGIN NOW Had cheered the face of earth, and dried the wet END
BEGIN NOW From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds, END
BEGIN NOW Who all things now behold more fresh and green, END
BEGIN NOW After a night of storm so ruinous, END
BEGIN NOW Cleared up their choicest notes in bush and spray, END
BEGIN NOW To gratulate the sweet return of morn. END
BEGIN NOW Nor yet, amidst this joy and brightest morn, END
BEGIN NOW Was absent, after all his mischief done, END
BEGIN NOW The Prince of Darkness; glad would also seem END
BEGIN NOW Of this fair change, and to our Saviour came; END
BEGIN NOW Yet with no new device (they all were spent), END
BEGIN NOW Rather by this his last affront resolved, END
BEGIN NOW Desperate of better course, to vent his rage END
BEGIN NOW And mad despite to be so oft repelled. END
BEGIN NOW Him walking on a sunny hill he found, END
BEGIN NOW Backed on the north and west by a thick wood; END
BEGIN NOW Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape, END
BEGIN NOW And in a careless mood thus to him said:-- END
BEGIN NOW Fair morning yet betides thee, Son of God, END
BEGIN NOW After a dismal night. I heard the wrack, END
BEGIN NOW As earth and sky would mingle; but myself END
BEGIN NOW Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them, END
BEGIN NOW As dangerous to the pillared frame of Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Or to the Earth's dark basis underneath, END
BEGIN NOW Are to the main as inconsiderable END
BEGIN NOW And harmless, if not wholesome, as a sneeze END
BEGIN NOW To man's less universe, and soon are gone. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, as being ofttimes noxious where they light END
BEGIN NOW On man, beast, plant, wasteful and turbulent, END
BEGIN NOW Like turbulencies in the affairs of men, END
BEGIN NOW Over whose heads they roar, and seem to point, END
BEGIN NOW They oft fore-signify and threaten ill. END
BEGIN NOW This tempest at this desert most was bent; END
BEGIN NOW Of men at thee, for only thou here dwell'st. END
BEGIN NOW Did I not tell thee, if thou didst reject END
BEGIN NOW The perfect season offered with my aid END
BEGIN NOW To win thy destined seat, but wilt prolong END
BEGIN NOW All to the push of fate, pursue thy way END
BEGIN NOW Of gaining David's throne no man knows when END
BEGIN NOW (For both the when and how is nowhere told), END
BEGIN NOW Thou shalt be what thou art ordained, no doubt; END
BEGIN NOW For Angels have proclaimed it, but concealing END
BEGIN NOW The time and means? Each act is rightliest done END
BEGIN NOW Not when it must, but when it may be best. END
BEGIN NOW If thou observe not this, be sure to find END
BEGIN NOW What I foretold thee--many a hard assay END
BEGIN NOW Of dangers, and adversities, and pains, END
BEGIN NOW Ere thou of Israel's sceptre get fast hold; END
BEGIN NOW Whereof this ominous night that closed thee round, END
BEGIN NOW So many terrors, voices, prodigies, END
BEGIN NOW May warn thee, as a sure foregoing sign. END
BEGIN NOW So talked he, while the Son of God went on, END
BEGIN NOW And staid not, but in brief him answered thus:-- END
BEGIN NOW Me worse than wet thou find'st not; other harm END
BEGIN NOW Those terrors which thou speak'st of did me none. END
BEGIN NOW I never feared they could, though noising loud END
BEGIN NOW And threatening nigh: what they can do as signs END
BEGIN NOW Betokening or ill-boding I contemn END
BEGIN NOW As false portents, not sent from God, but thee; END
BEGIN NOW Who, knowing I shall reign past thy preventing, END
BEGIN NOW Obtrud'st thy offered aid, that I, accepting, END
BEGIN NOW At least might seem to hold all power of thee, END
BEGIN NOW Ambitious Spirit! and would'st be thought my God; END
BEGIN NOW And storm'st, refused, thinking to terrify END
BEGIN NOW Me to thy will! Desist (thou art discerned, END
BEGIN NOW And toil'st in vain), nor me in vain molest. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Fiend, now swoln with rage, replied:-- END
BEGIN NOW Then hear, O Son of David, virgin-born! END
BEGIN NOW For Son of God to me is yet in doubt. END
BEGIN NOW Of the Messiah I have heard foretold END
BEGIN NOW By all the Prophets; of thy birth, at length END
BEGIN NOW Announced by Gabriel, with the first I knew, END
BEGIN NOW And of the angelic song in Bethlehem field, END
BEGIN NOW On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born. END
BEGIN NOW From that time seldom have I ceased to eye END
BEGIN NOW Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth, END
BEGIN NOW Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred; END
BEGIN NOW Till, at the ford of Jordan, whither all END
BEGIN NOW Flocked to the Baptist, I among the rest END
BEGIN NOW (Though not to be baptized), by voice from Heaven END
BEGIN NOW Heard thee pronounced the Son of God beloved. END
BEGIN NOW Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view END
BEGIN NOW And narrower scrutiny, that I might learn END
BEGIN NOW In what degree or meaning thou art called END
BEGIN NOW The Son of God, which bears no single sense. END
BEGIN NOW The Son of God I also am, or was; END
BEGIN NOW And, if I was, I am; relation stands: END
BEGIN NOW All men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought END
BEGIN NOW In some respect far higher so declared. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore I watched thy footsteps from that hour, END
BEGIN NOW And followed thee still on to this waste wild, END
BEGIN NOW Where, by all best conjectures, I collect END
BEGIN NOW Thou art to be my fatal enemy. END
BEGIN NOW Good reason, then, if I beforehand seek END
BEGIN NOW To understand my adversary, who END
BEGIN NOW And what he is; his wisdom, power, intent; END
BEGIN NOW By parle or composition, truce or league, END
BEGIN NOW To win him, or win from him what I can. END
BEGIN NOW And opportunity I here have had END
BEGIN NOW To try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee END
BEGIN NOW Proof against all temptation, as a rock END
BEGIN NOW Of adamant and as a centre, firm END
BEGIN NOW To the utmost of mere man both wise and good, END
BEGIN NOW Not more; for honours, riches, kingdoms, glory, END
BEGIN NOW Have been before contemned, and may again. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore, to know what more thou art than man, END
BEGIN NOW Worth naming the Son of God by voice from Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW Another method I must now begin. END
BEGIN NOW So saying, he caught him up, and, without wing END
BEGIN NOW Of hippogrif, bore through the air sublime, END
BEGIN NOW Over the wilderness and o'er the plain, END
BEGIN NOW Till underneath them fair Jerusalem, END
BEGIN NOW The Holy City, lifted high her towers, END
BEGIN NOW And higher yet the glorious Temple reared END
BEGIN NOW Her pile, far off appearing like a mount END
BEGIN NOW Of alablaster, topt with golden spires: END
BEGIN NOW There, on the highest pinnacle, he set END
BEGIN NOW The Son of God, and added thus in scorn:-- END
BEGIN NOW There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright END
BEGIN NOW Will ask thee skill. I to thy Father's house END
BEGIN NOW Have brought thee, and highest placed: highest is best. END
BEGIN NOW Now shew thy progeny; if not to stand, END
BEGIN NOW Cast thyself down. Safely, if Son of God; END
BEGIN NOW For it is written, 'He will give command END
BEGIN NOW Concerning thee to his Angels; in their hands END
BEGIN NOW They shall uplift thee, lest at any time END
BEGIN NOW Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone.' END
BEGIN NOW To whom thus Jesus: "Also it is written, END
BEGIN NOW 'Tempt not the Lord thy God.'" He said, and stood; END
BEGIN NOW But Satan, smitten with amazement, fell. END
BEGIN NOW As when Earth's son, Antaeus (to compare END
BEGIN NOW Small things with greatest), in Irassa strove END
BEGIN NOW With Jove's Alcides, and, oft foiled, still rose, END
BEGIN NOW Receiving from his mother Earth new strength, END
BEGIN NOW Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joined, END
BEGIN NOW Throttled at length in the air expired and fell, END
BEGIN NOW So, after many a foil, the Tempter proud, END
BEGIN NOW Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride END
BEGIN NOW Fell whence he stood to see his victor fall; END
BEGIN NOW And, as that Theban monster that proposed END
BEGIN NOW Her riddle, and him who solved it not devoured, END
BEGIN NOW That once found out and solved, for grief and spite END
BEGIN NOW Cast herself headlong from the Ismenian steep, END
BEGIN NOW So, strook with dread and anguish, fell the Fiend, END
BEGIN NOW And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought END
BEGIN NOW Joyless triumphals of his hoped success, END
BEGIN NOW Ruin, and desperation, and dismay, END
BEGIN NOW Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God. END
BEGIN NOW So Satan fell; and straight a fiery globe END
BEGIN NOW Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh, END
BEGIN NOW Who on their plumy vans received Him soft END
BEGIN NOW From his uneasy station, and upbore, END
BEGIN NOW As on a floating couch, through the blithe air; END
BEGIN NOW Then, in a flowery valley, set him down END
BEGIN NOW On a green bank, and set before him spread END
BEGIN NOW A table of celestial food, divine END
BEGIN NOW Ambrosial fruits fetched from the Tree of Life, END
BEGIN NOW And from the Fount of Life ambrosial drink, END
BEGIN NOW That soon refreshed him wearied, and repaired END
BEGIN NOW What hunger, if aught hunger, had impaired, END
BEGIN NOW Or thirst; and, as he fed, Angelic quires END
BEGIN NOW Sung heavenly anthems of his victory END
BEGIN NOW Over temptation and the Tempter proud:-- END
BEGIN NOW True Image of the Father, whether throned END
BEGIN NOW In the bosom of bliss, and light of light END
BEGIN NOW Conceiving, or, remote from Heaven, enshrined END
BEGIN NOW In fleshly tabernacle and human form, END
BEGIN NOW Wandering the wilderness--whatever place, END
BEGIN NOW Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing END
BEGIN NOW The Son of God, with Godlike force endued END
BEGIN NOW Against the attempter of thy Father's throne END
BEGIN NOW And thief of Paradise! Him long of old END
BEGIN NOW Thou didst debel, and down from Heaven cast END
BEGIN NOW With all his army; now thou hast avenged END
BEGIN NOW Supplanted Adam, and, by vanquishing END
BEGIN NOW Temptation, hast regained lost Paradise, END
BEGIN NOW And frustrated the conquest fraudulent. END
BEGIN NOW He never more henceforth will dare set foot END
BEGIN NOW In paradise to tempt; his snares are broke. END
BEGIN NOW For, though that seat of earthly bliss be failed, END
BEGIN NOW A fairer Paradise is founded now END
BEGIN NOW For Adam and his chosen sons, whom thou, END
BEGIN NOW A Saviour, art come down to reinstall; END
BEGIN NOW Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall be, END
BEGIN NOW Of tempter and temptation without fear. END
BEGIN NOW But thou, Infernal Serpent! shalt not long END
BEGIN NOW Rule in the clouds. Like an autumnal star, END
BEGIN NOW Or lightning, thou shalt fall from Heaven, trod down END
BEGIN NOW Under his feet. For proof, ere this thou feel'st END
BEGIN NOW Thy wound (yet not thy last and deadliest wound) END
BEGIN NOW By this repulse received, and hold'st in Hell END
BEGIN NOW No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon rues END
BEGIN NOW Thy bold attempt. Hereafter learn with awe END
BEGIN NOW To dread the Son of God. He, all unarmed, END
BEGIN NOW Shall chase thee, with the terror of his voice, END
BEGIN NOW From thy demoniac holds, possession foul-- END
BEGIN NOW Thee and thy legions; yelling they shall fly, END
BEGIN NOW And beg to hide them in a herd of swine, END
BEGIN NOW Lest he command them down into the Deep, END
BEGIN NOW Bound, and to torment sent before their time. END
BEGIN NOW Hail, Son of the Most High, heir of both Worlds, END
BEGIN NOW Queller of Satan! On thy glorious work END
BEGIN NOW Now enter, and begin to save Mankind. END
BEGIN NOW Thus they the Son of God, our Saviour meek, END
BEGIN NOW Sung victor, and, from heavenly feast refreshed, END
BEGIN NOW Brought on his way with joy. He, unobserved, END
BEGIN NOW Home to his mother's house private returned. END
BEGIN NOW All I could see from where I stood END
BEGIN NOW The room is full of you!--As I came in END
BEGIN NOW Curse thee, Life, I will live with thee no more! END
BEGIN NOW God's World END
BEGIN NOW O world, I cannot hold thee close enough! END
BEGIN NOW I will be the gladdest thing END
BEGIN NOW Sorrow like a ceaseless rain END
BEGIN NOW I'll keep a little tavern END
BEGIN NOW Love has gone and left me and the days are all alike; END
BEGIN NOW I knew her for a little ghost END
BEGIN NOW The first rose on my rose-tree END
BEGIN NOW Let the little birds sing; END
BEGIN NOW All the dog-wood blossoms are underneath the tree! END
BEGIN NOW Death, I say, my heart is bowed END
BEGIN NOW Love, if I weep it will not matter, END
BEGIN NOW I said,--for Love was laggard, O, Love was slow to come,-- END
BEGIN NOW She is neither pink nor pale, END
BEGIN NOW Hard seeds of hate I planted END
BEGIN NOW I cannot but remember END
BEGIN NOW Thou art not lovelier than lilacs,--no, END
BEGIN NOW Time does not bring relief; you all have lied END
BEGIN NOW Mindful of you the sodden earth in spring, END
BEGIN NOW Not in this chamber only at my birth-- END
BEGIN NOW If I should learn, in some quite casual way, END
BEGIN NOW This door you might not open, and you did; END
BEGIN NOW All I could see from where I stood END
BEGIN NOW Was three long mountains and a wood; END
BEGIN NOW I turned and looked another way, END
BEGIN NOW And saw three islands in a bay. END
BEGIN NOW So with my eyes I traced the line END
BEGIN NOW Of the horizon, thin and fine, END
BEGIN NOW Straight around till I was come END
BEGIN NOW Back to where I'd started from; END
BEGIN NOW And all I saw from where I stood END
BEGIN NOW Was three long mountains and a wood. END
BEGIN NOW Over these things I could not see; END
BEGIN NOW These were the things that bounded me; END
BEGIN NOW And I could touch them with my hand, END
BEGIN NOW Almost, I thought, from where I stand. END
BEGIN NOW And all at once things seemed so small END
BEGIN NOW My breath came short, and scarce at all. END
BEGIN NOW But, sure, the sky is big, I said; END
BEGIN NOW Miles and miles above my head; END
BEGIN NOW So here upon my back I'll lie END
BEGIN NOW And look my fill into the sky. END
BEGIN NOW And so I looked, and, after all, END
BEGIN NOW The sky was not so very tall. END
BEGIN NOW The sky, I said, must somewhere stop, END
BEGIN NOW And--sure enough!--I see the top! END
BEGIN NOW The sky, I thought, is not so grand; END
BEGIN NOW I 'most could touch it with my hand! END
BEGIN NOW And reaching up my hand to try, END
BEGIN NOW I screamed to feel it touch the sky. END
BEGIN NOW I screamed, and--lo!--Infinity END
BEGIN NOW Came down and settled over me; END
BEGIN NOW Forced back my scream into my chest, END
BEGIN NOW Bent back my arm upon my breast, END
BEGIN NOW And, pressing of the Undefined END
BEGIN NOW The definition on my mind, END
BEGIN NOW Held up before my eyes a glass END
BEGIN NOW Through which my shrinking sight did pass END
BEGIN NOW Until it seemed I must behold END
BEGIN NOW Immensity made manifold; END
BEGIN NOW Whispered to me a word whose sound END
BEGIN NOW Deafened the air for worlds around, END
BEGIN NOW And brought unmuffled to my ears END
BEGIN NOW The gossiping of friendly spheres, END
BEGIN NOW The creaking of the tented sky, END
BEGIN NOW The ticking of Eternity. END
BEGIN NOW I saw and heard, and knew at last END
BEGIN NOW The How and Why of all things, past, END
BEGIN NOW And present, and forevermore. END
BEGIN NOW The Universe, cleft to the core, END
BEGIN NOW Lay open to my probing sense END
BEGIN NOW That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence END
BEGIN NOW But could not,--nay! But needs must suck END
BEGIN NOW At the great wound, and could not pluck END
BEGIN NOW My lips away till I had drawn END
BEGIN NOW All venom out.--Ah, fearful pawn! END
BEGIN NOW For my omniscience paid I toll END
BEGIN NOW In infinite remorse of soul. END
BEGIN NOW All sin was of my sinning, all END
BEGIN NOW Atoning mine, and mine the gall END
BEGIN NOW Of all regret. Mine was the weight END
BEGIN NOW Of every brooded wrong, the hate END
BEGIN NOW That stood behind each envious thrust, END
BEGIN NOW Mine every greed, mine every lust. END
BEGIN NOW And all the while for every grief, END
BEGIN NOW Each suffering, I craved relief END
BEGIN NOW With individual desire,-- END
BEGIN NOW Craved all in vain! And felt fierce fire END
BEGIN NOW About a thousand people crawl; END
BEGIN NOW Perished with each,--then mourned for all! END
BEGIN NOW A man was starving in Capri; END
BEGIN NOW He moved his eyes and looked at me; END
BEGIN NOW I felt his gaze, I heard his moan, END
BEGIN NOW And knew his hunger as my own. END
BEGIN NOW I saw at sea a great fog bank END
BEGIN NOW Between two ships that struck and sank; END
BEGIN NOW A thousand screams the heavens smote; END
BEGIN NOW And every scream tore through my throat. END
BEGIN NOW No hurt I did not feel, no death END
BEGIN NOW That was not mine; mine each last breath END
BEGIN NOW That, crying, met an answering cry END
BEGIN NOW From the compassion that was I. END
BEGIN NOW All suffering mine, and mine its rod; END
BEGIN NOW Mine, pity like the pity of God. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, awful weight! Infinity END
BEGIN NOW Pressed down upon the finite Me! END
BEGIN NOW My anguished spirit, like a bird, END
BEGIN NOW Beating against my lips I heard; END
BEGIN NOW Yet lay the weight so close about END
BEGIN NOW There was no room for it without. END
BEGIN NOW And so beneath the weight lay I END
BEGIN NOW And suffered death, but could not die. END
BEGIN NOW Long had I lain thus, craving death, END
BEGIN NOW When quietly the earth beneath END
BEGIN NOW Gave way, and inch by inch, so great END
BEGIN NOW At last had grown the crushing weight, END
BEGIN NOW Into the earth I sank till I END
BEGIN NOW Full six feet under ground did lie, END
BEGIN NOW And sank no more,--there is no weight END
BEGIN NOW Can follow here, however great. END
BEGIN NOW From off my breast I felt it roll, END
BEGIN NOW And as it went my tortured soul END
BEGIN NOW Burst forth and fled in such a gust END
BEGIN NOW That all about me swirled the dust. END
BEGIN NOW Deep in the earth I rested now; END
BEGIN NOW Cool is its hand upon the brow END
BEGIN NOW And soft its breast beneath the head END
BEGIN NOW Of one who is so gladly dead. END
BEGIN NOW And all at once, and over all END
BEGIN NOW The pitying rain began to fall; END
BEGIN NOW I lay and heard each pattering hoof END
BEGIN NOW Upon my lowly, thatched roof, END
BEGIN NOW And seemed to love the sound far more END
BEGIN NOW Than ever I had done before. END
BEGIN NOW For rain it hath a friendly sound END
BEGIN NOW To one who's six feet underground; END
BEGIN NOW And scarce the friendly voice or face: END
BEGIN NOW A grave is such a quiet place. END
BEGIN NOW The rain, I said, is kind to come END
BEGIN NOW And speak to me in my new home. END
BEGIN NOW I would I were alive again END
BEGIN NOW To kiss the fingers of the rain, END
BEGIN NOW To drink into my eyes the shine END
BEGIN NOW Of every slanting silver line, END
BEGIN NOW To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze END
BEGIN NOW From drenched and dripping apple-trees. END
BEGIN NOW For soon the shower will be done, END
BEGIN NOW And then the broad face of the sun END
BEGIN NOW Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth END
BEGIN NOW Until the world with answering mirth END
BEGIN NOW Shakes joyously, and each round drop END
BEGIN NOW Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top. END
BEGIN NOW How can I bear it; buried here, END
BEGIN NOW While overhead the sky grows clear END
BEGIN NOW And blue again after the storm? END
BEGIN NOW O, multi-colored, multiform, END
BEGIN NOW Beloved beauty over me, END
BEGIN NOW That I shall never, never see END
BEGIN NOW Again! Spring-silver, autumn-gold, END
BEGIN NOW That I shall never more behold! END
BEGIN NOW Sleeping your myriad magics through, END
BEGIN NOW Close-sepulchred away from you! END
BEGIN NOW O God, I cried, give me new birth, END
BEGIN NOW And put me back upon the earth! END
BEGIN NOW Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd END
BEGIN NOW And let the heavy rain, down-poured END
BEGIN NOW In one big torrent, set me free, END
BEGIN NOW Washing my grave away from me! END
BEGIN NOW I ceased; and through the breathless hush END
BEGIN NOW That answered me, the far-off rush END
BEGIN NOW Of herald wings came whispering END
BEGIN NOW Like music down the vibrant string END
BEGIN NOW Of my ascending prayer, and--crash! END
BEGIN NOW Before the wild wind's whistling lash END
BEGIN NOW The startled storm-clouds reared on high END
BEGIN NOW And plunged in terror down the sky, END
BEGIN NOW And the big rain in one black wave END
BEGIN NOW Fell from the sky and struck my grave. END
BEGIN NOW I know not how such things can be; END
BEGIN NOW I only know there came to me END
BEGIN NOW A fragrance such as never clings END
BEGIN NOW To aught save happy living things; END
BEGIN NOW A sound as of some joyous elf END
BEGIN NOW Singing sweet songs to please himself, END
BEGIN NOW And, through and over everything, END
BEGIN NOW A sense of glad awakening. END
BEGIN NOW The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear, END
BEGIN NOW Whispering to me I could hear; END
BEGIN NOW I felt the rain's cool finger-tips END
BEGIN NOW Brushed tenderly across my lips, END
BEGIN NOW Laid gently on my sealed sight, END
BEGIN NOW And all at once the heavy night END
BEGIN NOW Fell from my eyes and I could see,-- END
BEGIN NOW A drenched and dripping apple-tree, END
BEGIN NOW A last long line of silver rain, END
BEGIN NOW A sky grown clear and blue again. END
BEGIN NOW And as I looked a quickening gust END
BEGIN NOW Of wind blew up to me and thrust END
BEGIN NOW Into my face a miracle END
BEGIN NOW Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,-- END
BEGIN NOW I know not how such things can be!-- END
BEGIN NOW I breathed my soul back into me. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! Up then from the ground sprang I END
BEGIN NOW And hailed the earth with such a cry END
BEGIN NOW As is not heard save from a man END
BEGIN NOW Who has been dead, and lives again. END
BEGIN NOW About the trees my arms I wound; END
BEGIN NOW Like one gone mad I hugged the ground; END
BEGIN NOW I raised my quivering arms on high; END
BEGIN NOW I laughed and laughed into the sky, END
BEGIN NOW Till at my throat a strangling sob END
BEGIN NOW Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb END
BEGIN NOW Sent instant tears into my eyes; END
BEGIN NOW O God, I cried, no dark disguise END
BEGIN NOW Can e'er hereafter hide from me END
BEGIN NOW Thy radiant identity! END
BEGIN NOW Thou canst not move across the grass END
BEGIN NOW But my quick eyes will see Thee pass, END
BEGIN NOW Nor speak, however silently, END
BEGIN NOW But my hushed voice will answer Thee. END
BEGIN NOW I know the path that tells Thy way END
BEGIN NOW Through the cool eve of every day; END
BEGIN NOW God, I can push the grass apart END
BEGIN NOW And lay my finger on Thy heart! END
BEGIN NOW The world stands out on either side END
BEGIN NOW No wider than the heart is wide; END
BEGIN NOW Above the world is stretched the sky,-- END
BEGIN NOW No higher than the soul is high. END
BEGIN NOW The heart can push the sea and land END
BEGIN NOW Farther away on either hand; END
BEGIN NOW The soul can split the sky in two, END
BEGIN NOW And let the face of God shine through. END
BEGIN NOW But East and West will pinch the heart END
BEGIN NOW That can not keep them pushed apart; END
BEGIN NOW And he whose soul is flat--the sky END
BEGIN NOW Will cave in on him by and by. END
BEGIN NOW The room is full of you!--As I came in END
BEGIN NOW And closed the door behind me, all at once END
BEGIN NOW A something in the air, intangible, END
BEGIN NOW Yet stiff with meaning, struck my senses sick!-- END
BEGIN NOW Sharp, unfamiliar odors have destroyed END
BEGIN NOW Each other room's dear personality. END
BEGIN NOW The heavy scent of damp, funereal flowers,-- END
BEGIN NOW The very essence, hush-distilled, of Death-- END
BEGIN NOW Has strangled that habitual breath of home END
BEGIN NOW Whose expiration leaves all houses dead; END
BEGIN NOW And wheresoe'er I look is hideous change. END
BEGIN NOW Save here. Here 'twas as if a weed-choked gate END
BEGIN NOW Had opened at my touch, and I had stepped END
BEGIN NOW Into some long-forgot, enchanted, strange, END
BEGIN NOW Sweet garden of a thousand years ago END
BEGIN NOW And suddenly thought, "I have been here before! END
BEGIN NOW You are not here. I know that you are gone, END
BEGIN NOW And will not ever enter here again. END
BEGIN NOW And yet it seems to me, if I should speak, END
BEGIN NOW Your silent step must wake across the hall; END
BEGIN NOW If I should turn my head, that your sweet eyes END
BEGIN NOW Would kiss me from the door.--So short a time END
BEGIN NOW To teach my life its transposition to END
BEGIN NOW This difficult and unaccustomed key!-- END
BEGIN NOW The room is as you left it; your last touch-- END
BEGIN NOW A thoughtless pressure, knowing not itself END
BEGIN NOW As saintly--hallows now each simple thing; END
BEGIN NOW Hallows and glorifies, and glows between END
BEGIN NOW The dust's grey fingers like a shielded light. END
BEGIN NOW There is your book, just as you laid it down, END
BEGIN NOW Face to the table,--I cannot believe END
BEGIN NOW That you are gone!--Just then it seemed to me END
BEGIN NOW You must be here. I almost laughed to think END
BEGIN NOW How like reality the dream had been; END
BEGIN NOW Yet knew before I laughed, and so was still. END
BEGIN NOW That book, outspread, just as you laid it down! END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps you thought, "I wonder what comes next, END
BEGIN NOW And whether this or this will be the end"; END
BEGIN NOW So rose, and left it, thinking to return. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps that chair, when you arose and passed END
BEGIN NOW Out of the room, rocked silently a while END
BEGIN NOW Ere it again was still. When you were gone END
BEGIN NOW Forever from the room, perhaps that chair, END
BEGIN NOW Stirred by your movement, rocked a little while, END
BEGIN NOW Silently, to and fro. . . END
BEGIN NOW And here are the last words your fingers wrote, END
BEGIN NOW Scrawled in broad characters across a page END
BEGIN NOW In this brown book I gave you. Here your hand, END
BEGIN NOW Guiding your rapid pen, moved up and down. END
BEGIN NOW Here with a looping knot you crossed a t", END
BEGIN NOW And here another like it, just beyond END
BEGIN NOW These two eccentric "e's". You were so small, END
BEGIN NOW And wrote so brave a hand! END
BEGIN NOW How strange it seems END
BEGIN NOW That of all words these are the words you chose! END
BEGIN NOW And yet a simple choice; you did not know END
BEGIN NOW You would not write again. If you had known-- END
BEGIN NOW But then, it does not matter,--and indeed END
BEGIN NOW If you had known there was so little time END
BEGIN NOW You would have dropped your pen and come to me END
BEGIN NOW And this page would be empty, and some phrase END
BEGIN NOW Other than this would hold my wonder now. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, since you could not know, and it befell END
BEGIN NOW That these are the last words your fingers wrote, END
BEGIN NOW There is a dignity some might not see END
BEGIN NOW In this, "I picked the first sweet-pea to-day. END
BEGIN NOW To-day! Was there an opening bud beside it END
BEGIN NOW You left until to-morrow?--O my love, END
BEGIN NOW The things that withered,--and you came not back! END
BEGIN NOW That day you filled this circle of my arms END
BEGIN NOW That now is empty. (O my empty life!) END
BEGIN NOW That day--that day you picked the first sweet-pea,-- END
BEGIN NOW And brought it in to show me! I recall END
BEGIN NOW With terrible distinctness how the smell END
BEGIN NOW Of your cool gardens drifted in with you. END
BEGIN NOW I know, you held it up for me to see END
BEGIN NOW And flushed because I looked not at the flower, END
BEGIN NOW But at your face; and when behind my look END
BEGIN NOW You saw such unmistakable intent END
BEGIN NOW You laughed and brushed your flower against my lips. END
BEGIN NOW (You were the fairest thing God ever made, END
BEGIN NOW I think.) And then your hands above my heart END
BEGIN NOW Drew down its stem into a fastening, END
BEGIN NOW And while your head was bent I kissed your hair. END
BEGIN NOW I wonder if you knew. (Beloved hands! END
BEGIN NOW Somehow I cannot seem to see them still. END
BEGIN NOW Somehow I cannot seem to see the dust END
BEGIN NOW In your bright hair.) What is the need of Heaven END
BEGIN NOW When earth can be so sweet?--If only God END
BEGIN NOW Had let us love,--and show the world the way! END
BEGIN NOW Strange cancellings must ink th' eternal books END
BEGIN NOW When love-crossed-out will bring the answer right! END
BEGIN NOW That first sweet-pea! I wonder where it is. END
BEGIN NOW It seems to me I laid it down somewhere, END
BEGIN NOW And yet,--I am not sure. I am not sure, END
BEGIN NOW Even, if it was white or pink; for then END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas much like any other flower to me, END
BEGIN NOW Save that it was the first. I did not know, END
BEGIN NOW Then, that it was the last. If I had known-- END
BEGIN NOW But then, it does not matter. Strange how few, END
BEGIN NOW After all's said and done, the things that are END
BEGIN NOW Of moment. END
BEGIN NOW Few indeed! When I can make END
BEGIN NOW Of ten small words a rope to hang the world! END
BEGIN NOW I had you and I have you now no more. END
BEGIN NOW There, there it dangles,--where's the little truth END
BEGIN NOW That can for long keep footing under that END
BEGIN NOW When its slack syllables tighten to a thought? END
BEGIN NOW Here, let me write it down! I wish to see END
BEGIN NOW Just how a thing like that will look on paper! END
BEGIN NOW *I had you and I have you now no more*. END
BEGIN NOW O little words, how can you run so straight END
BEGIN NOW Across the page, beneath the weight you bear? END
BEGIN NOW How can you fall apart, whom such a theme END
BEGIN NOW Has bound together, and hereafter aid END
BEGIN NOW In trivial expression, that have been END
BEGIN NOW So hideously dignified?--Would God END
BEGIN NOW That tearing you apart would tear the thread END
BEGIN NOW I strung you on! Would God--O God, my mind END
BEGIN NOW Stretches asunder on this merciless rack END
BEGIN NOW Of imagery! O, let me sleep a while! END
BEGIN NOW Would I could sleep, and wake to find me back END
BEGIN NOW In that sweet summer afternoon with you. END
BEGIN NOW Summer? 'Tis summer still by the calendar! END
BEGIN NOW How easily could God, if He so willed, END
BEGIN NOW Set back the world a little turn or two! END
BEGIN NOW Correct its griefs, and bring its joys again! END
BEGIN NOW We were so wholly one I had not thought END
BEGIN NOW That we could die apart. I had not thought END
BEGIN NOW That I could move,--and you be stiff and still! END
BEGIN NOW I think our heart-strings were, like warp and woof END
BEGIN NOW In some firm fabric, woven in and out; END
BEGIN NOW Your golden filaments in fair design END
BEGIN NOW Across my duller fibre. And to-day END
BEGIN NOW The shining strip is rent; the exquisite END
BEGIN NOW Fine pattern is destroyed; part of your heart END
BEGIN NOW Aches in my breast; part of my heart lies chilled END
BEGIN NOW In the damp earth with you. I have been torn END
BEGIN NOW In two, and suffer for the rest of me. END
BEGIN NOW What is my life to me? And what am I END
BEGIN NOW To life,--a ship whose star has guttered out? END
BEGIN NOW A Fear that in the deep night starts awake END
BEGIN NOW Perpetually, to find its senses strained END
BEGIN NOW Against the taut strings of the quivering air, END
BEGIN NOW Awaiting the return of some dread chord? END
BEGIN NOW Dark, Dark, is all I find for metaphor; END
BEGIN NOW All else were contrast,--save that contrast's wall END
BEGIN NOW Is down, and all opposed things flow together END
BEGIN NOW Into a vast monotony, where night END
BEGIN NOW And day, and frost and thaw, and death and life, END
BEGIN NOW Are synonyms. What now--what now to me END
BEGIN NOW Are all the jabbering birds and foolish flowers END
BEGIN NOW That clutter up the world? You were my song! END
BEGIN NOW Now, let discord scream! You were my flower! END
BEGIN NOW Now let the world grow weeds! For I shall not END
BEGIN NOW Plant things above your grave--(the common balm END
BEGIN NOW Of the conventional woe for its own wound!) END
BEGIN NOW Amid sensations rendered negative END
BEGIN NOW By your elimination stands to-day, END
BEGIN NOW Certain, unmixed, the element of grief; END
BEGIN NOW I sorrow; and I shall not mock my truth END
BEGIN NOW With travesties of suffering, nor seek END
BEGIN NOW To effigy its incorporeal bulk END
BEGIN NOW In little wry-faced images of woe. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot call you back; and I desire END
BEGIN NOW No utterance of my immaterial voice. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot even turn my face this way END
BEGIN NOW Or that, and say, "My face is turned to you"; END
BEGIN NOW I know not where you are, I do not know END
BEGIN NOW If Heaven hold you or if earth transmute, END
BEGIN NOW Body and soul, you into earth again; END
BEGIN NOW But this I know:--not for one second's space END
BEGIN NOW Shall I insult my sight with visionings END
BEGIN NOW Such as the credulous crowd so eager-eyed END
BEGIN NOW Beholds, self-conjured, in the empty air. END
BEGIN NOW Let the world wail! Let drip its easy tears! END
BEGIN NOW --What do I say? END
BEGIN NOW God! God!--God pity me! Am I gone mad END
BEGIN NOW That I should spit upon a rosary? END
BEGIN NOW Am I become so shrunken? Would to God END
BEGIN NOW I too might feel that frenzied faith whose touch END
BEGIN NOW Makes temporal the most enduring grief; END
BEGIN NOW Though it must walk a while, as is its wont, END
BEGIN NOW With wild lamenting! Would I too might weep END
BEGIN NOW Where weeps the world and hangs its piteous wreaths END
BEGIN NOW For its new dead! Not Truth, but Faith, it is END
BEGIN NOW That keeps the world alive. If all at once END
BEGIN NOW Faith were to slacken,--that unconscious faith END
BEGIN NOW Which must, I know, yet be the corner-stone END
BEGIN NOW Of all believing,--birds now flying fearless END
BEGIN NOW Across would drop in terror to the earth; END
BEGIN NOW Fishes would drown; and the all-governing reins END
BEGIN NOW Would tangle in the frantic hands of God END
BEGIN NOW And the worlds gallop headlong to destruction! END
BEGIN NOW O God, I see it now, and my sick brain END
BEGIN NOW Staggers and swoons! How often over me END
BEGIN NOW Flashes this breathlessness of sudden sight END
BEGIN NOW In which I see the universe unrolled END
BEGIN NOW Before me like a scroll and read thereon END
BEGIN NOW Chaos and Doom, where helpless planets whirl END
BEGIN NOW Dizzily round and round and round and round, END
BEGIN NOW Like tops across a table, gathering speed END
BEGIN NOW With every spin, to waver on the edge END
BEGIN NOW One instant--looking over--and the next END
BEGIN NOW To shudder and lurch forward out of sight-- END
BEGIN NOW Ah, I am worn out--I am wearied out-- END
BEGIN NOW It is too much--I am but flesh and blood, END
BEGIN NOW And I must sleep. Though you were dead again, END
BEGIN NOW I am but flesh and blood and I must sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Curse thee, Life, I will live with thee no more! END
BEGIN NOW Thou hast mocked me, starved me, beat my body sore! END
BEGIN NOW And all for a pledge that was not pledged by me, END
BEGIN NOW I have kissed thy crust and eaten sparingly END
BEGIN NOW That I might eat again, and met thy sneers END
BEGIN NOW With deprecations, and thy blows with tears,-- END
BEGIN NOW Aye, from thy glutted lash, glad, crawled away, END
BEGIN NOW As if spent passion were a holiday! END
BEGIN NOW And now I go. Nor threat, nor easy vow END
BEGIN NOW With me, whence fear and faith alike are flown; END
BEGIN NOW Lonely I came, and I depart alone, END
BEGIN NOW And know not where nor unto whom I go; END
BEGIN NOW But that thou canst not follow me I know. END
BEGIN NOW Thus I to Life, and ceased; but through my brain END
BEGIN NOW My thought ran still, until I spake again: END
BEGIN NOW Ah, but I go not as I came,--no trace END
BEGIN NOW Is mine to bear away of that old grace END
BEGIN NOW I brought! I have been heated in thy fires, END
BEGIN NOW Bent by thy hands, fashioned to thy desires, END
BEGIN NOW Thy mark is on me! I am not the same END
BEGIN NOW Nor ever more shall be, as when I came. END
BEGIN NOW Ashes am I of all that once I seemed. END
BEGIN NOW In me all's sunk that leapt, and all that dreamed END
BEGIN NOW Is wakeful for alarm,--oh, shame to thee, END
BEGIN NOW For the ill change that thou hast wrought in me, END
BEGIN NOW Who laugh no more nor lift my throat to sing! END
BEGIN NOW Ah, Life, I would have been a pleasant thing END
BEGIN NOW To have about the house when I was grown END
BEGIN NOW If thou hadst left my little joys alone! END
BEGIN NOW I asked of thee no favor save this one: END
BEGIN NOW That thou wouldst leave me playing in the sun! END
BEGIN NOW And this thou didst deny, calling my name END
BEGIN NOW Insistently, until I rose and came. END
BEGIN NOW I saw the sun no more.--It were not well END
BEGIN NOW So long on these unpleasant thoughts to dwell, END
BEGIN NOW Need I arise to-morrow and renew END
BEGIN NOW Again my hated tasks, but I am through END
BEGIN NOW With all things save my thoughts and this one night, END
BEGIN NOW So that in truth I seem already quite END
BEGIN NOW Free and remote from thee,--I feel no haste END
BEGIN NOW And no reluctance to depart; I taste END
BEGIN NOW Merely, with thoughtful mien, an unknown draught, END
BEGIN NOW That in a little while I shall have quaffed. END
BEGIN NOW Thus I to Life, and ceased, and slightly smiled, END
BEGIN NOW Looking at nothing; and my thin dreams filed END
BEGIN NOW Before me one by one till once again END
BEGIN NOW I set new words unto an old refrain: END
BEGIN NOW Treasures thou hast that never have been mine! END
BEGIN NOW Warm lights in many a secret chamber shine END
BEGIN NOW Of thy gaunt house, and gusts of song have blown END
BEGIN NOW Like blossoms out to me that sat alone! END
BEGIN NOW And I have waited well for thee to show END
BEGIN NOW If any share were mine,--and now I go! END
BEGIN NOW Nothing I leave, and if I naught attain END
BEGIN NOW I shall but come into mine own again! END
BEGIN NOW Thus I to Life, and ceased, and spake no more, END
BEGIN NOW But turning, straightway, sought a certain door END
BEGIN NOW In the rear wall. Heavy it was, and low END
BEGIN NOW And dark,--a way by which none e'er would go END
BEGIN NOW That other exit had, and never knock END
BEGIN NOW Was heard thereat,--bearing a curious lock END
BEGIN NOW Some chance had shown me fashioned faultily, END
BEGIN NOW Whereof Life held content the useless key, END
BEGIN NOW And great coarse hinges, thick and rough with rust, END
BEGIN NOW Whose sudden voice across a silence must, END
BEGIN NOW I knew, be harsh and horrible to hear,-- END
BEGIN NOW A strange door, ugly like a dwarf.--So near END
BEGIN NOW I came I felt upon my feet the chill END
BEGIN NOW Of acid wind creeping across the sill. END
BEGIN NOW So stood longtime, till over me at last END
BEGIN NOW Came weariness, and all things other passed END
BEGIN NOW To make it room; the still night drifted deep END
BEGIN NOW Like snow about me, and I longed for sleep. END
BEGIN NOW But, suddenly, marking the morning hour, END
BEGIN NOW Bayed the deep-throated bell within the tower! END
BEGIN NOW Startled, I raised my head,--and with a shout END
BEGIN NOW Laid hold upon the latch,--and was without. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, long-forgotten, well-remembered road, END
BEGIN NOW Leading me back unto my old abode, END
BEGIN NOW My father's house! There in the night I came, END
BEGIN NOW And found them feasting, and all things the same END
BEGIN NOW As they had been before. A splendour hung END
BEGIN NOW Upon the walls, and such sweet songs were sung END
BEGIN NOW As, echoing out of very long ago, END
BEGIN NOW Had called me from the house of Life, I know. END
BEGIN NOW So fair their raiment shone I looked in shame END
BEGIN NOW On the unlovely garb in which I came; END
BEGIN NOW Then straightway at my hesitancy mocked: END
BEGIN NOW It is my father's house!" I said and knocked; END
BEGIN NOW And the door opened. To the shining crowd END
BEGIN NOW Tattered and dark I entered, like a cloud, END
BEGIN NOW Seeing no face but his; to him I crept, END
BEGIN NOW And "Father!" I cried, and clasped his knees, and wept. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, days of joy that followed! All alone END
BEGIN NOW I wandered through the house. My own, my own, END
BEGIN NOW My own to touch, my own to taste and smell, END
BEGIN NOW All I had lacked so long and loved so well! END
BEGIN NOW None shook me out of sleep, nor hushed my song, END
BEGIN NOW Nor called me in from the sunlight all day long. END
BEGIN NOW I know not when the wonder came to me END
BEGIN NOW Of what my father's business might be, END
BEGIN NOW And whither fared and on what errands bent END
BEGIN NOW The tall and gracious messengers he sent. END
BEGIN NOW Yet one day with no song from dawn till night END
BEGIN NOW Wondering, I sat, and watched them out of sight. END
BEGIN NOW And the next day I called; and on the third END
BEGIN NOW Asked them if I might go,--but no one heard. END
BEGIN NOW Then, sick with longing, I arose at last END
BEGIN NOW And went unto my father,--in that vast END
BEGIN NOW Chamber wherein he for so many years END
BEGIN NOW Has sat, surrounded by his charts and spheres. END
BEGIN NOW Father, I said, "Father, I cannot play END
BEGIN NOW The harp that thou didst give me, and all day END
BEGIN NOW I sit in idleness, while to and fro END
BEGIN NOW About me thy serene, grave servants go; END
BEGIN NOW And I am weary of my lonely ease. END
BEGIN NOW Better a perilous journey overseas END
BEGIN NOW Away from thee, than this, the life I lead, END
BEGIN NOW To sit all day in the sunshine like a weed END
BEGIN NOW That grows to naught,--I love thee more than they END
BEGIN NOW Who serve thee most; yet serve thee in no way. END
BEGIN NOW Father, I beg of thee a little task END
BEGIN NOW To dignify my days,--'tis all I ask END
BEGIN NOW Forever, but forever, this denied, END
BEGIN NOW I perish. END
BEGIN NOW Child, my father's voice replied, END
BEGIN NOW All things thy fancy hath desired of me END
BEGIN NOW Thou hast received. I have prepared for thee END
BEGIN NOW Within my house a spacious chamber, where END
BEGIN NOW Are delicate things to handle and to wear, END
BEGIN NOW And all these things are thine. Dost thou love song? END
BEGIN NOW My minstrels shall attend thee all day long. END
BEGIN NOW Or sigh for flowers? My fairest gardens stand END
BEGIN NOW Open as fields to thee on every hand. END
BEGIN NOW And all thy days this word shall hold the same: END
BEGIN NOW No pleasure shalt thou lack that thou shalt name. END
BEGIN NOW But as for tasks--" he smiled, and shook his head; END
BEGIN NOW Thou hadst thy task, and laidst it by", he said. END
BEGIN NOW God's World END
BEGIN NOW O world, I cannot hold thee close enough! END
BEGIN NOW Thy winds, thy wide grey skies! END
BEGIN NOW Thy mists, that roll and rise! END
BEGIN NOW Thy woods, this autumn day, that ache and sag END
BEGIN NOW And all but cry with colour! That gaunt crag END
BEGIN NOW To crush! To lift the lean of that black bluff! END
BEGIN NOW World, World, I cannot get thee close enough! END
BEGIN NOW Long have I known a glory in it all, END
BEGIN NOW But never knew I this; END
BEGIN NOW Here such a passion is END
BEGIN NOW As stretcheth me apart,--Lord, I do fear END
BEGIN NOW Thou'st made the world too beautiful this year; END
BEGIN NOW My soul is all but out of me,--let fall END
BEGIN NOW No burning leaf; prithee, let no bird call. END
BEGIN NOW I will be the gladdest thing END
BEGIN NOW Under the sun! END
BEGIN NOW I will touch a hundred flowers END
BEGIN NOW And not pick one. END
BEGIN NOW I will look at cliffs and clouds END
BEGIN NOW With quiet eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Watch the wind bow down the grass, END
BEGIN NOW And the grass rise. END
BEGIN NOW And when lights begin to show END
BEGIN NOW Up from the town, END
BEGIN NOW I will mark which must be mine, END
BEGIN NOW And then start down! END
BEGIN NOW Sorrow like a ceaseless rain END
BEGIN NOW Beats upon my heart. END
BEGIN NOW People twist and scream in pain,-- END
BEGIN NOW Dawn will find them still again; END
BEGIN NOW This has neither wax nor wane, END
BEGIN NOW Neither stop nor start. END
BEGIN NOW People dress and go to town; END
BEGIN NOW I sit in my chair. END
BEGIN NOW All my thoughts are slow and brown: END
BEGIN NOW Standing up or sitting down END
BEGIN NOW Little matters, or what gown END
BEGIN NOW Or what shoes I wear. END
BEGIN NOW I'll keep a little tavern END
BEGIN NOW Below the high hill's crest, END
BEGIN NOW Wherein all grey-eyed people END
BEGIN NOW May set them down and rest. END
BEGIN NOW There shall be plates a-plenty, END
BEGIN NOW And mugs to melt the chill END
BEGIN NOW Of all the grey-eyed people END
BEGIN NOW Who happen up the hill. END
BEGIN NOW There sound will sleep the traveller, END
BEGIN NOW And dream his journey's end, END
BEGIN NOW But I will rouse at midnight END
BEGIN NOW The falling fire to tend. END
BEGIN NOW Aye, 'tis a curious fancy-- END
BEGIN NOW But all the good I know END
BEGIN NOW Was taught me out of two grey eyes END
BEGIN NOW A long time ago. END
BEGIN NOW Love has gone and left me and the days are all alike; END
BEGIN NOW Eat I must, and sleep I will,--and would that night were here! END
BEGIN NOW But ah!--to lie awake and hear the slow hours strike! END
BEGIN NOW Would that it were day again!--with twilight near! END
BEGIN NOW Love has gone and left me and I don't know what to do; END
BEGIN NOW This or that or what you will is all the same to me; END
BEGIN NOW But all the things that I begin I leave before I'm through,-- END
BEGIN NOW There's little use in anything as far as I can see. END
BEGIN NOW Love has gone and left me,--and the neighbors knock and borrow, END
BEGIN NOW And life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse,-- END
BEGIN NOW And to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow END
BEGIN NOW There's this little street and this little house. END
BEGIN NOW I knew her for a little ghost END
BEGIN NOW That in my garden walked; END
BEGIN NOW The wall is high--higher than most-- END
BEGIN NOW And the green gate was locked. END
BEGIN NOW And yet I did not think of that END
BEGIN NOW Till after she was gone-- END
BEGIN NOW I knew her by the broad white hat, END
BEGIN NOW All ruffled, she had on. END
BEGIN NOW By the dear ruffles round her feet, END
BEGIN NOW By her small hands that hung END
BEGIN NOW In their lace mitts, austere and sweet, END
BEGIN NOW Her gown's white folds among. END
BEGIN NOW I watched to see if she would stay, END
BEGIN NOW What she would do--and oh! END
BEGIN NOW She looked as if she liked the way END
BEGIN NOW I let my garden grow! END
BEGIN NOW She bent above my favourite mint END
BEGIN NOW With conscious garden grace, END
BEGIN NOW She smiled and smiled--there was no hint END
BEGIN NOW Of sadness in her face. END
BEGIN NOW She held her gown on either side END
BEGIN NOW To let her slippers show, END
BEGIN NOW And up the walk she went with pride, END
BEGIN NOW The way great ladies go. END
BEGIN NOW And where the wall is built in new END
BEGIN NOW And is of ivy bare END
BEGIN NOW She paused--then opened and passed through END
BEGIN NOW A gate that once was there. END
BEGIN NOW Falls the knocker of my door-- END
BEGIN NOW Neither loud nor soft, END
BEGIN NOW But as long accustomed, END
BEGIN NOW Under Sorrow's hand? END
BEGIN NOW Marigolds around the step END
BEGIN NOW And rosemary stand, END
BEGIN NOW And then comes Sorrow-- END
BEGIN NOW And what does Sorrow care END
BEGIN NOW For the rosemary END
BEGIN NOW Or the marigolds there? END
BEGIN NOW Are we kin? END
BEGIN NOW That so oft upon my door-- END
BEGIN NOW The first rose on my rose-tree END
BEGIN NOW Budded, bloomed, and shattered, END
BEGIN NOW During sad days when to me END
BEGIN NOW Nothing mattered. END
BEGIN NOW Grief of grief has drained me clean; END
BEGIN NOW Still it seems a pity END
BEGIN NOW No one saw,--it must have been END
BEGIN NOW Very pretty. END
BEGIN NOW Let the little birds sing; END
BEGIN NOW Let the little lambs play; END
BEGIN NOW Spring is here; and so 'tis spring;-- END
BEGIN NOW But not in the old way! END
BEGIN NOW I recall a place END
BEGIN NOW Where a plum-tree grew; END
BEGIN NOW There you lifted up your face, END
BEGIN NOW And blossoms covered you. END
BEGIN NOW If the little birds sing, END
BEGIN NOW And the little lambs play, END
BEGIN NOW Spring is here; and so 'tis spring-- END
BEGIN NOW But not in the old way! END
BEGIN NOW All the dog-wood blossoms are underneath the tree! END
BEGIN NOW Ere spring was going--ah, spring is gone! END
BEGIN NOW And there comes no summer to the like of you and me,-- END
BEGIN NOW Blossom time is early, but no fruit sets on. END
BEGIN NOW All the dog-wood blossoms are underneath the tree, END
BEGIN NOW Browned at the edges, turned in a day; END
BEGIN NOW And I would with all my heart they trimmed a mound for me, END
BEGIN NOW And weeds were tall on all the paths that led that way! END
BEGIN NOW Death, I say, my heart is bowed END
BEGIN NOW Unto thine,--O mother! END
BEGIN NOW This red gown will make a shroud END
BEGIN NOW Good as any other! END
BEGIN NOW (I, that would not wait to wear END
BEGIN NOW My own bridal things, END
BEGIN NOW In a dress dark as my hair END
BEGIN NOW Made my answerings. END
BEGIN NOW I, to-night, that till he came END
BEGIN NOW Could not, could not wait, END
BEGIN NOW In a gown as bright as flame END
BEGIN NOW Held for them the gate.) END
BEGIN NOW Death, I say, my heart is bowed END
BEGIN NOW Unto thine,--O mother! END
BEGIN NOW This red gown will make a shroud END
BEGIN NOW Good as any other! END
BEGIN NOW Love, if I weep it will not matter, END
BEGIN NOW And if you laugh I shall not care; END
BEGIN NOW Foolish am I to think about it, END
BEGIN NOW But it is good to feel you there. END
BEGIN NOW Love, in my sleep I dreamed of waking,-- END
BEGIN NOW White and awful the moonlight reached END
BEGIN NOW Over the floor, and somewhere, somewhere, END
BEGIN NOW There was a shutter loose,--it screeched! END
BEGIN NOW Swung in the wind,--and no wind blowing!-- END
BEGIN NOW I was afraid, and turned to you, END
BEGIN NOW Put out my hand to you for comfort,-- END
BEGIN NOW And you were gone! Cold, cold as dew, END
BEGIN NOW Under my hand the moonlight lay! END
BEGIN NOW Love, if you laugh I shall not care, END
BEGIN NOW But if I weep it will not matter,-- END
BEGIN NOW Ah, it is good to feel you there! END
BEGIN NOW I said,--for Love was laggard, O, Love was slow to come,-- END
BEGIN NOW I'll hear his step and know his step when I am warm in bed; END
BEGIN NOW But I'll never leave my pillow, though there be some END
BEGIN NOW As would let him in--and take him in with tears!" I said. END
BEGIN NOW I lay,--for Love was laggard, O, he came not until dawn,-- END
BEGIN NOW I lay and listened for his step and could not get to sleep; END
BEGIN NOW And he found me at my window with my big cloak on, END
BEGIN NOW All sorry with the tears some folks might weep! END
BEGIN NOW She is neither pink nor pale, END
BEGIN NOW And she never will be all mine; END
BEGIN NOW She learned her hands in a fairy-tale, END
BEGIN NOW And her mouth on a valentine. END
BEGIN NOW She has more hair than she needs; END
BEGIN NOW In the sun 'tis a woe to me! END
BEGIN NOW And her voice is a string of colored beads, END
BEGIN NOW Or steps leading into the sea. END
BEGIN NOW She loves me all that she can, END
BEGIN NOW And her ways to my ways resign; END
BEGIN NOW But she was not made for any man, END
BEGIN NOW And she never will be all mine. END
BEGIN NOW Hard seeds of hate I planted END
BEGIN NOW That should by now be grown,-- END
BEGIN NOW Rough stalks, and from thick stamens END
BEGIN NOW A poisonous pollen blown, END
BEGIN NOW And odors rank, unbreathable, END
BEGIN NOW From dark corollas thrown! END
BEGIN NOW At dawn from my damp garden END
BEGIN NOW I shook the chilly dew; END
BEGIN NOW The thin boughs locked behind me END
BEGIN NOW That sprang to let me through; END
BEGIN NOW The blossoms slept,--I sought a place END
BEGIN NOW Where nothing lovely grew. END
BEGIN NOW And there, when day was breaking, END
BEGIN NOW I knelt and looked around: END
BEGIN NOW The light was near, the silence END
BEGIN NOW Was palpitant with sound; END
BEGIN NOW I drew my hate from out my breast END
BEGIN NOW And thrust it in the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, ye so fiercely tended, END
BEGIN NOW Ye little seeds of hate! END
BEGIN NOW I bent above your growing END
BEGIN NOW Early and noon and late, END
BEGIN NOW Yet are ye drooped and pitiful,-- END
BEGIN NOW I cannot rear ye straight! END
BEGIN NOW The sun seeks out my garden, END
BEGIN NOW No nook is left in shade, END
BEGIN NOW No mist nor mold nor mildew END
BEGIN NOW Endures on any blade, END
BEGIN NOW Sweet rain slants under every bough: END
BEGIN NOW Ye falter, and ye fade. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot but remember END
BEGIN NOW When the year grows old-- END
BEGIN NOW How she disliked the cold! END
BEGIN NOW She used to watch the swallows END
BEGIN NOW Go down across the sky, END
BEGIN NOW And turn from the window END
BEGIN NOW With a little sharp sigh. END
BEGIN NOW And often when the brown leaves END
BEGIN NOW Were brittle on the ground, END
BEGIN NOW And the wind in the chimney END
BEGIN NOW Made a melancholy sound, END
BEGIN NOW She had a look about her END
BEGIN NOW That I wish I could forget-- END
BEGIN NOW The look of a scared thing END
BEGIN NOW Sitting in a net! END
BEGIN NOW Oh, beautiful at nightfall END
BEGIN NOW The soft spitting snow! END
BEGIN NOW And beautiful the bare boughs END
BEGIN NOW Rubbing to and fro! END
BEGIN NOW But the roaring of the fire, END
BEGIN NOW And the warmth of fur, END
BEGIN NOW And the boiling of the kettle END
BEGIN NOW Were beautiful to her! END
BEGIN NOW I cannot but remember END
BEGIN NOW When the year grows old-- END
BEGIN NOW How she disliked the cold! END
BEGIN NOW Thou art not lovelier than lilacs,--no, END
BEGIN NOW Nor honeysuckle; thou art not more fair END
BEGIN NOW Than small white single poppies,--I can bear END
BEGIN NOW Thy beauty; though I bend before thee, though END
BEGIN NOW From left to right, not knowing where to go, END
BEGIN NOW I turn my troubled eyes, nor here nor there END
BEGIN NOW Find any refuge from thee, yet I swear END
BEGIN NOW So has it been with mist,--with moonlight so. END
BEGIN NOW Like him who day by day unto his draught END
BEGIN NOW Of delicate poison adds him one drop more END
BEGIN NOW Till he may drink unharmed the death of ten, END
BEGIN NOW Even so, inured to beauty, who have quaffed END
BEGIN NOW Each hour more deeply than the hour before, END
BEGIN NOW I drink--and live--what has destroyed some men. END
BEGIN NOW Time does not bring relief; you all have lied END
BEGIN NOW Who told me time would ease me of my pain! END
BEGIN NOW I miss him in the weeping of the rain; END
BEGIN NOW I want him at the shrinking of the tide; END
BEGIN NOW The old snows melt from every mountain-side, END
BEGIN NOW And last year's leaves are smoke in every lane; END
BEGIN NOW But last year's bitter loving must remain END
BEGIN NOW Heaped on my heart, and my old thoughts abide! END
BEGIN NOW There are a hundred places where I fear END
BEGIN NOW To go,--so with his memory they brim! END
BEGIN NOW And entering with relief some quiet place END
BEGIN NOW Where never fell his foot or shone his face END
BEGIN NOW I say, "There is no memory of him here! END
BEGIN NOW And so stand stricken, so remembering him! END
BEGIN NOW Mindful of you the sodden earth in spring, END
BEGIN NOW And all the flowers that in the springtime grow, END
BEGIN NOW And dusty roads, and thistles, and the slow END
BEGIN NOW Rising of the round moon, all throats that sing END
BEGIN NOW The summer through, and each departing wing, END
BEGIN NOW And all the nests that the bared branches show, END
BEGIN NOW And all winds that in any weather blow, END
BEGIN NOW And all the storms that the four seasons bring. END
BEGIN NOW You go no more on your exultant feet END
BEGIN NOW Up paths that only mist and morning knew, END
BEGIN NOW Or watch the wind, or listen to the beat END
BEGIN NOW Of a bird's wings too high in air to view,-- END
BEGIN NOW But you were something more than young and sweet END
BEGIN NOW And fair,--and the long year remembers you. END
BEGIN NOW Not in this chamber only at my birth-- END
BEGIN NOW When the long hours of that mysterious night END
BEGIN NOW Were over, and the morning was in sight-- END
BEGIN NOW I cried, but in strange places, steppe and firth END
BEGIN NOW I have not seen, through alien grief and mirth; END
BEGIN NOW And never shall one room contain me quite END
BEGIN NOW Who in so many rooms first saw the light, END
BEGIN NOW Child of all mothers, native of the earth. END
BEGIN NOW So is no warmth for me at any fire END
BEGIN NOW To-day, when the world's fire has burned so low; END
BEGIN NOW I kneel, spending my breath in vain desire, END
BEGIN NOW At that cold hearth which one time roared so strong, END
BEGIN NOW And straighten back in weariness, and long END
BEGIN NOW To gather up my little gods and go. END
BEGIN NOW If I should learn, in some quite casual way, END
BEGIN NOW That you were gone, not to return again-- END
BEGIN NOW Read from the back-page of a paper, say, END
BEGIN NOW Held by a neighbor in a subway train, END
BEGIN NOW How at the corner of this avenue END
BEGIN NOW And such a street (so are the papers filled) END
BEGIN NOW A hurrying man--who happened to be you-- END
BEGIN NOW At noon to-day had happened to be killed, END
BEGIN NOW I should not cry aloud--I could not cry END
BEGIN NOW Aloud, or wring my hands in such a place-- END
BEGIN NOW I should but watch the station lights rush by END
BEGIN NOW With a more careful interest on my face, END
BEGIN NOW Or raise my eyes and read with greater care END
BEGIN NOW Where to store furs and how to treat the hair. END
BEGIN NOW This door you might not open, and you did; END
BEGIN NOW So enter now, and see for what slight thing END
BEGIN NOW You are betrayed. . . . Here is no treasure hid, END
BEGIN NOW No cauldron, no clear crystal mirroring END
BEGIN NOW The sought-for truth, no heads of women slain END
BEGIN NOW For greed like yours, no writhings of distress, END
BEGIN NOW But only what you see. . . . Look yet again-- END
BEGIN NOW An empty room, cobwebbed and comfortless. END
BEGIN NOW Yet this alone out of my life I kept END
BEGIN NOW Unto myself, lest any know me quite; END
BEGIN NOW And you did so profane me when you crept END
BEGIN NOW Unto the threshold of this room to-night END
BEGIN NOW That I must never more behold your face. END
BEGIN NOW This now is yours. I seek another place. END
BEGIN NOW A Child's Garden of Verses END
BEGIN NOW For the long nights you lay awake END
BEGIN NOW And watched for my unworthy sake: END
BEGIN NOW For your most comfortable hand END
BEGIN NOW That led me through the uneven land: END
BEGIN NOW For all the story-books you read: END
BEGIN NOW For all the pains you comforted: END
BEGIN NOW For all you pitied, all you bore, END
BEGIN NOW In sad and happy days of yore:-- END
BEGIN NOW My second Mother, my first Wife, END

BEGIN NOW From the sick child, now well and old, END

BEGIN NOW I have to go to bed and see END
BEGIN NOW The birds still hopping on the tree, END
BEGIN NOW Or hear the grown-up people's feet END
BEGIN NOW Still going past me in the street. END
BEGIN NOW And does it not seem hard to you, END
BEGIN NOW When all the sky is clear and blue, END
BEGIN NOW And I should like so much to play, END

BEGIN NOW It is very nice to think END

BEGIN NOW With little children saying grace END

BEGIN NOW When I was down beside the sea END
BEGIN NOW To dig the sandy shore. END
BEGIN NOW My holes were empty like a cup. END
BEGIN NOW In every hole the sea came up, END
BEGIN NOW Till it could come no more. END
BEGIN NOW All night long and every night, END
BEGIN NOW When my mama puts out the light, END
BEGIN NOW I see the people marching by, END
BEGIN NOW As plain as day before my eye. END
BEGIN NOW Armies and emperor and kings, END
BEGIN NOW All carrying different kinds of things, END
BEGIN NOW And marching in so grand a way, END
BEGIN NOW You never saw the like by day. END
BEGIN NOW So fine a show was never seen END
BEGIN NOW At the great circus on the green; END
BEGIN NOW For every kind of beast and man END
BEGIN NOW Is marching in that caravan. END
BEGIN NOW As first they move a little slow, END
BEGIN NOW But still the faster on they go, END
BEGIN NOW And still beside me close I keep END
BEGIN NOW Until we reach the town of Sleep. END
BEGIN NOW A child should always say what's true END
BEGIN NOW And speak when he is spoken to, END
BEGIN NOW And behave mannerly at table; END
BEGIN NOW At least as far as he is able. END
BEGIN NOW The rain is falling all around, END
BEGIN NOW It falls on field and tree, END
BEGIN NOW It rains on the umbrellas here, END
BEGIN NOW And on the ships at sea. END
BEGIN NOW Three of us afloat in the meadow by the swing, END
BEGIN NOW Three of us abroad in the basket on the lea. END
BEGIN NOW Winds are in the air, they are blowing in the spring, END
BEGIN NOW And waves are on the meadow like the waves there are at sea. END
BEGIN NOW Where shall we adventure, to-day that we're afloat, END
BEGIN NOW Wary of the weather and steering by a star? END
BEGIN NOW Shall it be to Africa, a-steering of the boat, END
BEGIN NOW Hi! but here's a squadron a-rowing on the sea-- END
BEGIN NOW Cattle on the meadow a-charging with a roar! END
BEGIN NOW Quick, and we'll escape them, they're as mad as they can be, END
BEGIN NOW The wicket is the harbour and the garden is the shore. END
BEGIN NOW Up into the cherry tree END
BEGIN NOW Who should climb but little me? END
BEGIN NOW I held the trunk with both my hands END
BEGIN NOW And looked abroad in foreign lands. END
BEGIN NOW I saw the next door garden lie, END
BEGIN NOW Adorned with flowers, before my eye, END
BEGIN NOW And many pleasant places more END
BEGIN NOW That I had never seen before. END
BEGIN NOW I saw the dimpling river pass END
BEGIN NOW And be the sky's blue looking-glass; END
BEGIN NOW The dusty roads go up and down END
BEGIN NOW With people tramping in to town. END
BEGIN NOW If I could find a higher tree END
BEGIN NOW Farther and farther I should see, END
BEGIN NOW To where the grown-up river slips END
BEGIN NOW Into the sea among the ships, END
BEGIN NOW To where the roads on either hand END
BEGIN NOW Lead onward into fairy land, END
BEGIN NOW Where all the children dine at five, END
BEGIN NOW And all the playthings come alive. END
BEGIN NOW Whenever the moon and stars are set, END
BEGIN NOW Whenever the wind is high, END
BEGIN NOW All night long in the dark and wet, END
BEGIN NOW A man goes riding by. END
BEGIN NOW Late in the night when the fires are out, END
BEGIN NOW Why does he gallop and gallop about? END
BEGIN NOW Whenever the trees are crying aloud, END
BEGIN NOW And ships are tossed at sea, END
BEGIN NOW By, on the highway, low and loud, END
BEGIN NOW By at the gallop goes he. END
BEGIN NOW By at the gallop he goes, and then END
BEGIN NOW By he comes back at the gallop again. END
BEGIN NOW I should like to rise and go END
BEGIN NOW Where the golden apples grow;-- END
BEGIN NOW Where below another sky END
BEGIN NOW Parrot islands anchored lie, END
BEGIN NOW And, watched by cockatoos and goats, END
BEGIN NOW Lonely Crusoes building boats;-- END
BEGIN NOW Where in sunshine reaching out END
BEGIN NOW Eastern cities, miles about, END
BEGIN NOW Are with mosque and minaret END
BEGIN NOW Among sandy gardens set, END
BEGIN NOW And the rich goods from near and far END
BEGIN NOW Hang for sale in the bazaar;-- END
BEGIN NOW Where the Great Wall round China goes, END
BEGIN NOW And on one side the desert blows, END
BEGIN NOW And with the voice and bell and drum, END
BEGIN NOW Cities on the other hum;-- END
BEGIN NOW Where are forests hot as fire, END
BEGIN NOW Wide as England, tall as a spire, END
BEGIN NOW Full of apes and cocoa-nuts END
BEGIN NOW Where the knotty crocodile END
BEGIN NOW Lies and blinks in the Nile, END
BEGIN NOW And the red flamingo flies END
BEGIN NOW Hunting fish before his eyes;-- END
BEGIN NOW Where in jungles near and far, END
BEGIN NOW Man-devouring tigers are, END
BEGIN NOW Lying close and giving ear END
BEGIN NOW Lest the hunt be drawing near, END
BEGIN NOW Or a comer-by be seen END
BEGIN NOW Swinging in the palanquin;-- END
BEGIN NOW Where among the desert sands END
BEGIN NOW Some deserted city stands, END
BEGIN NOW All its children, sweep and prince, END
BEGIN NOW Grown to manhood ages since, END
BEGIN NOW Not a foot in street or house, END
BEGIN NOW Not a stir of child or mouse, END
BEGIN NOW And when kindly falls the night, END
BEGIN NOW In all the town no spark of light. END
BEGIN NOW There I'll come when I'm a man END
BEGIN NOW With a camel caravan; END
BEGIN NOW Light a fire in the gloom END
BEGIN NOW Of some dusty dining room; END
BEGIN NOW See the pictures on the walls, END
BEGIN NOW Heroes, fights and festivals; END
BEGIN NOW And in a corner find the toys END
BEGIN NOW Of speckled eggs the birdie sings END
BEGIN NOW And nests among the trees; END
BEGIN NOW The sailor sings of ropes and things END
BEGIN NOW In ships upon the seas. END
BEGIN NOW The children sing in Spain; END
BEGIN NOW The organ with the organ man END
BEGIN NOW Is singing in the rain. END
BEGIN NOW When I am grown to man's estate END
BEGIN NOW I shall be very proud and great, END
BEGIN NOW And tell the other girls and boys END
BEGIN NOW Not to meddle with my toys. END
BEGIN NOW We built a ship upon the stairs END
BEGIN NOW All made of the back-bedroom chairs, END
BEGIN NOW And filled it full of sofa pillows END
BEGIN NOW To go a-sailing on the billows. END
BEGIN NOW We took a saw and several nails, END
BEGIN NOW And water in the nursery pails; END
BEGIN NOW And Tom said, "Let us also take END
BEGIN NOW An apple and a slice of cake;"-- END
BEGIN NOW Which was enough for Tom and me END
BEGIN NOW To go a-sailing on, till tea. END
BEGIN NOW We sailed along for days and days, END
BEGIN NOW And had the very best of plays; END
BEGIN NOW But Tom fell out and hurt his knee, END
BEGIN NOW So there was no one left but me. END
BEGIN NOW Dark brown is the river, END
BEGIN NOW Golden is the sand. END
BEGIN NOW It flows along for ever, END
BEGIN NOW With trees on either hand. END
BEGIN NOW Green leaves a-floating, END
BEGIN NOW Castles of the foam, END
BEGIN NOW Boats of mine a-boating-- END
BEGIN NOW Where will all come home? END
BEGIN NOW On goes the river END
BEGIN NOW And out past the mill, END
BEGIN NOW Away down the valley, END
BEGIN NOW Away down the hill. END
BEGIN NOW Away down the river, END
BEGIN NOW A hundred miles or more, END
BEGIN NOW Other little children END
BEGIN NOW Shall bring my boats ashore. END
BEGIN NOW Auntie's Skirts END
BEGIN NOW Whenever Auntie moves around, END
BEGIN NOW Her dresses make a curious sound, END
BEGIN NOW They trail behind her up the floor, END
BEGIN NOW And trundle after through the door. END
BEGIN NOW When I was sick and lay a-bed, END
BEGIN NOW I had two pillows at my head, END
BEGIN NOW And all my toys beside me lay, END
BEGIN NOW To keep me happy all the day. END
BEGIN NOW And sometimes for an hour or so END
BEGIN NOW I watched my leaden soldiers go, END
BEGIN NOW With different uniforms and drills, END
BEGIN NOW Among the bed-clothes, through the hills; END
BEGIN NOW And sometimes sent my ships in fleets END
BEGIN NOW All up and down among the sheets; END
BEGIN NOW Or brought my trees and houses out, END
BEGIN NOW And planted cities all about. END
BEGIN NOW I was the giant great and still END
BEGIN NOW That sits upon the pillow-hill, END
BEGIN NOW And sees before him, dale and plain, END
BEGIN NOW The pleasant land of counterpane. END
BEGIN NOW From breakfast on through all the day END
BEGIN NOW At home among my friends I stay, END
BEGIN NOW But every night I go abroad END
BEGIN NOW Afar into the land of Nod. END
BEGIN NOW All by myself I have to go, END
BEGIN NOW With none to tell me what to do-- END
BEGIN NOW All alone beside the streams END
BEGIN NOW And up the mountain-sides of dreams. END
BEGIN NOW The strangest things are these for me, END
BEGIN NOW Both things to eat and things to see, END
BEGIN NOW And many frightening sights abroad END
BEGIN NOW Till morning in the land of Nod. END
BEGIN NOW Try as I like to find the way, END
BEGIN NOW I never can get back by day, END
BEGIN NOW Nor can remember plain and clear END
BEGIN NOW The curious music that I hear. END
BEGIN NOW I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me, END
BEGIN NOW And what can be the use of him is more than I can see. END
BEGIN NOW He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head; END
BEGIN NOW And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed. END
BEGIN NOW The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow-- END
BEGIN NOW Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow; END
BEGIN NOW For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball, END
BEGIN NOW And he sometimes goes so little that there's none of him at all. END
BEGIN NOW He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play, END
BEGIN NOW And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way. END
BEGIN NOW He stays so close behind me, he's a coward you can see; END
BEGIN NOW I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me! END
BEGIN NOW One morning, very early, before the sun was up, END
BEGIN NOW I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup; END
BEGIN NOW But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head, END
BEGIN NOW Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed. END
BEGIN NOW Every night my prayers I say, END
BEGIN NOW And get my dinner every day; END
BEGIN NOW And every day that I've been good, END
BEGIN NOW I get an orange after food. END
BEGIN NOW The child that is not clean and neat, END
BEGIN NOW With lots of toys and things to eat, END
BEGIN NOW He is a naughty child, I'm sure-- END
BEGIN NOW Or else his dear papa is poor. END
BEGIN NOW I woke before the morning, I was happy all the day, END
BEGIN NOW I never said an ugly word, but smiled and stuck to play. END
BEGIN NOW And now at last the sun is going down behind the wood, END
BEGIN NOW And I am very happy, for I know that I've been good. END
BEGIN NOW My bed is waiting cool and fresh, with linen smooth and fair, END
BEGIN NOW And I must be off to sleepsin-by, and not forget my prayer. END
BEGIN NOW I know that, till to-morrow I shall see the sun arise, END
BEGIN NOW No ugly dream shall fright my mind, no ugly sight my eyes. END
BEGIN NOW But slumber hold me tightly till I waken in the dawn, END
BEGIN NOW And hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn. END
BEGIN NOW The lights from the parlour and kitchen shone out END
BEGIN NOW Through the blinds and the windows and bars; END
BEGIN NOW And high overhead and all moving about, END
BEGIN NOW There were thousands of millions of stars. END
BEGIN NOW There ne'er were such thousands of leaves on a tree, END
BEGIN NOW Nor of people in church or the Park, END
BEGIN NOW As the crowds of the stars that looked down upon me, END
BEGIN NOW And that glittered and winked in the dark. END
BEGIN NOW The Dog, and the Plough, and the Hunter, and all, END
BEGIN NOW And the star of the sailor, and Mars, END
BEGIN NOW These shown in the sky, and the pail by the wall END
BEGIN NOW Would be half full of water and stars. END
BEGIN NOW They saw me at last, and they chased me with cries, END
BEGIN NOW And they soon had me packed into bed; END
BEGIN NOW But the glory kept shining and bright in my eyes, END
BEGIN NOW And the stars going round in my head. END
BEGIN NOW Bring the comb and play upon it! END
BEGIN NOW Marching, here we come! END
BEGIN NOW Willie cocks his highland bonnet, END
BEGIN NOW Johnnie beats the drum. END
BEGIN NOW Mary Jane commands the party, END
BEGIN NOW Peter leads the rear; END
BEGIN NOW Feet in time, alert and hearty, END
BEGIN NOW All in the most martial manner END
BEGIN NOW Marching double-quick; END
BEGIN NOW While the napkin, like a banner, END
BEGIN NOW Waves upon the stick! END
BEGIN NOW Here's enough of fame and pillage, END
BEGIN NOW Great commander Jane! END
BEGIN NOW Now that we've been round the village, END
BEGIN NOW Let's go home again. END
BEGIN NOW The friendly cow all red and white, END
BEGIN NOW I love with all my heart: END
BEGIN NOW She gives me cream with all her might, END
BEGIN NOW To eat with apple-tart. END
BEGIN NOW She wanders lowing here and there, END
BEGIN NOW And yet she cannot stray, END
BEGIN NOW All in the pleasant open air, END
BEGIN NOW The pleasant light of day; END
BEGIN NOW And blown by all the winds that pass END
BEGIN NOW And wet with all the showers, END
BEGIN NOW She walks among the meadow grass END
BEGIN NOW And eats the meadow flowers. END
BEGIN NOW The world is so full of a number of things, END
BEGIN NOW I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings. END
BEGIN NOW I saw you toss the kites on high END
BEGIN NOW And blow the birds about the sky; END
BEGIN NOW And all around I heard you pass, END
BEGIN NOW Like ladies' skirts across the grass-- END
BEGIN NOW O wind, a-blowing all day long, END
BEGIN NOW O wind, that sings so loud a song! END
BEGIN NOW I saw the different things you did, END
BEGIN NOW But always you yourself you hid. END
BEGIN NOW I felt you push, I heard you call, END
BEGIN NOW I could not see yourself at all-- END
BEGIN NOW O wind, a-blowing all day long, END
BEGIN NOW O wind, that sings so loud a song! END
BEGIN NOW O you that are so strong and cold, END
BEGIN NOW O blower, are you young or old? END
BEGIN NOW Are you a beast of field and tree, END
BEGIN NOW Or just a stronger child than me? END
BEGIN NOW O wind, a-blowing all day long, END
BEGIN NOW O wind, that sings so loud a song! END
BEGIN NOW Over the borders, a sin without pardon, END
BEGIN NOW Breaking the branches and crawling below, END
BEGIN NOW Out through the breach in the wall of the garden, END
BEGIN NOW Down by the banks of the river we go. END
BEGIN NOW Here is a mill with the humming of thunder, END
BEGIN NOW Here is the weir with the wonder of foam, END
BEGIN NOW Here is the sluice with the race running under-- END
BEGIN NOW Marvellous places, though handy to home! END
BEGIN NOW Sounds of the village grow stiller and stiller, END
BEGIN NOW Stiller the note of the birds on the hill; END
BEGIN NOW Dusty and dim are the eyes of the miller, END
BEGIN NOW Deaf are his ears with the moil of the mill. END
BEGIN NOW Years may go by, and the wheel in the river END
BEGIN NOW Wheel as it wheels for us, children, to-day, END
BEGIN NOW Wheel and keep roaring and foaming for ever END
BEGIN NOW Long after all of the boys are away. END
BEGIN NOW Home for the Indies and home from the ocean, END
BEGIN NOW Heroes and soldiers we all will come home; END
BEGIN NOW Still we shall find the old mill wheel in motion, END
BEGIN NOW Turning and churning that river to foam. END
BEGIN NOW You with the bean that I gave when we quarrelled, END
BEGIN NOW I with your marble of Saturday last, END
BEGIN NOW Honoured and old and all gaily apparelled, END
BEGIN NOW Here we shall meet and remember the past. END
BEGIN NOW Children, you are very little, END
BEGIN NOW And your bones are very brittle; END
BEGIN NOW If you would grow great and stately, END
BEGIN NOW You must try to walk sedately. END
BEGIN NOW You must still be bright and quiet, END
BEGIN NOW And content with simple diet; END
BEGIN NOW And remain, through all bewild'ring, END
BEGIN NOW Innocent and honest children. END
BEGIN NOW Happy hearts and happy faces, END
BEGIN NOW Happy play in grassy places-- END
BEGIN NOW That was how in ancient ages, END
BEGIN NOW Children grew to kings and sages. END
BEGIN NOW But the unkind and the unruly, END
BEGIN NOW And the sort who eat unduly, END
BEGIN NOW They must never hope for glory-- END
BEGIN NOW Theirs is quite a different story! END
BEGIN NOW Cruel children, crying babies, END
BEGIN NOW All grow up as geese and gabies, END
BEGIN NOW Hated, as their age increases, END
BEGIN NOW By their nephews and their nieces. END
BEGIN NOW Little frosty Eskimo, END
BEGIN NOW Oh! don't you wish that you were me? END
BEGIN NOW You have seen the scarlet trees END
BEGIN NOW And the lions over seas; END
BEGIN NOW You have eaten ostrich eggs, END
BEGIN NOW And turned the turtles off their legs. END
BEGIN NOW Such a life is very fine, END
BEGIN NOW But it's not so nice as mine: END
BEGIN NOW You must often as you trod, END
BEGIN NOW Have wearied NOT to be abroad. END
BEGIN NOW You have curious things to eat, END
BEGIN NOW I am fed on proper meat; END
BEGIN NOW You must dwell upon the foam, END
BEGIN NOW But I am safe and live at home. END
BEGIN NOW Little frosty Eskimo, END
BEGIN NOW Oh! don't you wish that you were me? END
BEGIN NOW The sun is not a-bed, when I END
BEGIN NOW At night upon my pillow lie; END
BEGIN NOW Still round the earth his way he takes, END
BEGIN NOW And morning after morning makes. END
BEGIN NOW While here at home, in shining day, END
BEGIN NOW We round the sunny garden play, END
BEGIN NOW Each little Indian sleepy-head END
BEGIN NOW Is being kissed and put to bed. END
BEGIN NOW And when at eve I rise from tea, END
BEGIN NOW Day dawns beyond the Atlantic Sea; END
BEGIN NOW And all the children in the west END
BEGIN NOW Are getting up and being dressed. END
BEGIN NOW My tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky. END
BEGIN NOW It's time to take the window to see Leerie going by; END
BEGIN NOW For every night at teatime and before you take your seat, END
BEGIN NOW With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street. END
BEGIN NOW Now Tom would be a driver and Maria go to sea, END
BEGIN NOW And my papa's a banker and as rich as he can be; END
BEGIN NOW But I, when I am stronger and can choose what I'm to do, END
BEGIN NOW O Leerie, I'll go round at night and light the lamps with you! END
BEGIN NOW For we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door, END
BEGIN NOW And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more; END
BEGIN NOW And oh! before you hurry by with ladder and with light; END
BEGIN NOW O Leerie, see a little child and nod to him to-night! END
BEGIN NOW My bed is like a little boat; END
BEGIN NOW Nurse helps me in when I embark; END
BEGIN NOW She girds me in my sailor's coat END
BEGIN NOW And starts me in the dark. END
BEGIN NOW At night I go on board and say END
BEGIN NOW Good-night to all my friends on shore; END
BEGIN NOW I shut my eyes and sail away END
BEGIN NOW And see and hear no more. END
BEGIN NOW And sometimes things to bed I take, END
BEGIN NOW As prudent sailors have to do; END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake, END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps a toy or two. END
BEGIN NOW All night across the dark we steer; END
BEGIN NOW But when the day returns at last, END
BEGIN NOW Safe in my room beside the pier, END
BEGIN NOW I find my vessel fast. END
BEGIN NOW The moon has a face like the clock in the hall; END
BEGIN NOW She shines on thieves on the garden wall, END
BEGIN NOW On streets and fields and harbour quays, END
BEGIN NOW And birdies asleep in the forks of the trees. END
BEGIN NOW The squalling cat and the squeaking mouse, END
BEGIN NOW The howling dog by the door of the house, END
BEGIN NOW The bat that lies in bed at noon, END
BEGIN NOW All love to be out by the light of the moon. END
BEGIN NOW But all of the things that belong to the day END
BEGIN NOW Cuddle to sleep to be out of her way; END
BEGIN NOW And flowers and children close their eyes END
BEGIN NOW Till up in the morning the sun shall arise. END
BEGIN NOW How do you like to go up in a swing, END
BEGIN NOW Up in the air so blue? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing END
BEGIN NOW Ever a child can do! END
BEGIN NOW Up in the air and over the wall, END
BEGIN NOW Till I can see so wide, END
BEGIN NOW River and trees and cattle and all END
BEGIN NOW Over the countryside-- END
BEGIN NOW Till I look down on the garden green, END
BEGIN NOW Down on the roof so brown-- END
BEGIN NOW Up in the air I go flying again, END
BEGIN NOW Up in the air and down! END
BEGIN NOW A birdie with a yellow bill END
BEGIN NOW Hopped upon my window sill, END
BEGIN NOW Cocked his shining eye and said: END
BEGIN NOW Ain't you 'shamed, you sleepy-head! END
BEGIN NOW Smooth it glides upon its travel, END
BEGIN NOW Here a wimple, there a gleam-- END
BEGIN NOW O the clean gravel! END
BEGIN NOW O the smooth stream! END
BEGIN NOW Sailing blossoms, silver fishes, END
BEGIN NOW Paven pools as clear as air-- END
BEGIN NOW How a child wishes END
BEGIN NOW To live down there! END
BEGIN NOW We can see our colored faces END
BEGIN NOW Floating on the shaken pool END
BEGIN NOW Down in cool places, END
BEGIN NOW Dim and very cool; END
BEGIN NOW Till a wind or water wrinkle, END
BEGIN NOW Dipping marten, plumping trout, END
BEGIN NOW Spreads in a twinkle END
BEGIN NOW And blots all out. END
BEGIN NOW See the rings pursue each other; END
BEGIN NOW All below grows black as night, END
BEGIN NOW Just as if mother END
BEGIN NOW Had blown out the light! END
BEGIN NOW Patience, children, just a minute-- END
BEGIN NOW See the spreading circles die; END
BEGIN NOW The stream and all in it END
BEGIN NOW Will clear by-and-by. END
BEGIN NOW Come up here, O dusty feet! END
BEGIN NOW Here is fairy bread to eat. END
BEGIN NOW Here in my retiring room, END
BEGIN NOW Children, you may dine END
BEGIN NOW On the golden smell of broom END
BEGIN NOW And the shade of pine; END
BEGIN NOW And when you have eaten well, END
BEGIN NOW Fairy stories hear and tell. END
BEGIN NOW Faster than fairies, faster than witches, END
BEGIN NOW Bridges and houses, hedges and ditches; END
BEGIN NOW And charging along like troops in a battle END
BEGIN NOW All through the meadows the horses and cattle: END
BEGIN NOW All of the sights of the hill and the plain END
BEGIN NOW Fly as thick as driving rain; END
BEGIN NOW And ever again, in the wink of an eye, END
BEGIN NOW Painted stations whistle by. END
BEGIN NOW Here is a child who clambers and scrambles, END
BEGIN NOW All by himself and gathering brambles; END
BEGIN NOW Here is a tramp who stands and gazes; END
BEGIN NOW And here is the green for stringing the daisies! END
BEGIN NOW Here is a cart run away in the road END
BEGIN NOW Lumping along with man and load; END
BEGIN NOW And here is a mill, and there is a river: END
BEGIN NOW Each a glimpse and gone forever! END
BEGIN NOW Late lies the wintry sun a-bed, END
BEGIN NOW A frosty, fiery sleepy-head; END
BEGIN NOW Blinks but an hour or two; and then, END
BEGIN NOW A blood-red orange, sets again. END
BEGIN NOW Before the stars have left the skies, END
BEGIN NOW At morning in the dark I rise; END
BEGIN NOW And shivering in my nakedness, END
BEGIN NOW By the cold candle, bathe and dress. END
BEGIN NOW Close by the jolly fire I sit END
BEGIN NOW To warm my frozen bones a bit; END
BEGIN NOW Or with a reindeer-sled, explore END
BEGIN NOW The colder countries round the door. END
BEGIN NOW When to go out, my nurse doth wrap END
BEGIN NOW Me in my comforter and cap; END
BEGIN NOW The cold wind burns my face, and blows END
BEGIN NOW Its frosty pepper up my nose. END
BEGIN NOW Black are my steps on silver sod; END
BEGIN NOW Thick blows my frosty breath abroad; END
BEGIN NOW And tree and house, and hill and lake, END
BEGIN NOW Are frosted like a wedding cake. END
BEGIN NOW Through all the pleasant meadow-side END
BEGIN NOW The grass grew shoulder-high, END
BEGIN NOW Till the shining scythes went far and wide END
BEGIN NOW And cut it down to dry. END
BEGIN NOW Those green and sweetly smelling crops END
BEGIN NOW They led in waggons home; END
BEGIN NOW And they piled them here in mountain tops END
BEGIN NOW For mountaineers to roam. END
BEGIN NOW The mice that in these mountains dwell, END
BEGIN NOW No happier are than I! END
BEGIN NOW Oh, what a joy to clamber there, END
BEGIN NOW Oh, what a place for play, END
BEGIN NOW With the sweet, the dim, the dusty air, END
BEGIN NOW The happy hills of hay! END
BEGIN NOW The coach is at the door at last; END
BEGIN NOW The eager children, mounting fast END
BEGIN NOW And kissing hands, in chorus sing: END
BEGIN NOW Good-bye, good-bye, to everything! END
BEGIN NOW To house and garden, field and lawn, END
BEGIN NOW The meadow-gates we swang upon, END
BEGIN NOW To pump and stable, tree and swing, END
BEGIN NOW Good-bye, good-bye, to everything! END
BEGIN NOW And fare you well for evermore, END
BEGIN NOW O ladder at the hayloft door, END
BEGIN NOW O hayloft where the cobwebs cling, END
BEGIN NOW Good-bye, good-bye, to everything! END
BEGIN NOW Crack goes the whip, and off we go; END
BEGIN NOW The trees and houses smaller grow; END
BEGIN NOW Last, round the woody turn we sing: END
BEGIN NOW Good-bye, good-bye, to everything! END
BEGIN NOW When the bright lamp is carried in, END
BEGIN NOW The sunless hours again begin; END
BEGIN NOW O'er all without, in field and lane, END
BEGIN NOW The haunted night returns again. END
BEGIN NOW Now we behold the embers flee END
BEGIN NOW About the firelit hearth; and see END
BEGIN NOW Our faces painted as we pass, END
BEGIN NOW Like pictures, on the window glass. END
BEGIN NOW Must we to bed indeed? Well then, END
BEGIN NOW Let us arise and go like men, END
BEGIN NOW And face with an undaunted tread END
BEGIN NOW The long black passage up to bed. END
BEGIN NOW Farewell, O brother, sister, sire! END
BEGIN NOW O pleasant party round the fire! END
BEGIN NOW The songs you sing, the tales you tell, END
BEGIN NOW Till far to-morrow, fare you well! END
BEGIN NOW All around the house is the jet-black night; END
BEGIN NOW It stares through the window-pane; END
BEGIN NOW It crawls in the corners, hiding from the light, END
BEGIN NOW And it moves with the moving flame. END
BEGIN NOW Now my little heart goes a beating like a drum, END
BEGIN NOW With the breath of the Bogies in my hair; END
BEGIN NOW And all around the candle the crooked shadows come, END
BEGIN NOW And go marching along up the stair. END
BEGIN NOW The shadow of the balusters, the shadow of the lamp, END
BEGIN NOW The shadow of the child that goes to bed-- END
BEGIN NOW All the wicked shadows coming tramp, tramp, tramp, END
BEGIN NOW With the black night overhead. END
BEGIN NOW Last, to the chamber where I lie END
BEGIN NOW My fearful footsteps patter nigh, END
BEGIN NOW And come out from the cold and gloom END
BEGIN NOW Into my warm and cheerful room. END
BEGIN NOW There, safe arrived, we turn about END
BEGIN NOW To keep the coming shadows out, END
BEGIN NOW And close the happy door at last END
BEGIN NOW On all the perils that we past. END
BEGIN NOW Then, when mamma goes by to bed, END
BEGIN NOW She shall come in with tip-toe tread, END
BEGIN NOW And see me lying warm and fast END
BEGIN NOW And in the land of Nod at last. END
BEGIN NOW When children are playing alone on the green, END
BEGIN NOW In comes the playmate that never was seen. END
BEGIN NOW When children are happy and lonely and good, END
BEGIN NOW The Friend of the Children comes out of the wood. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody heard him, and nobody saw, END
BEGIN NOW His is a picture you never could draw, END
BEGIN NOW But he's sure to be present, abroad or at home, END
BEGIN NOW When children are happy and playing alone. END
BEGIN NOW He lies in the laurels, he runs on the grass, END
BEGIN NOW He sings when you tinkle the musical glass; END
BEGIN NOW Whene'er you are happy and cannot tell why, END
BEGIN NOW The Friend of the Children is sure to be by! END
BEGIN NOW He loves to be little, he hates to be big, END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis he that inhabits the caves that you dig; END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis he when you play with your soldiers of tin END
BEGIN NOW That sides with the Frenchmen and never can win. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis he, when at night you go off to your bed, END
BEGIN NOW Bids you go to sleep and not trouble your head; END
BEGIN NOW For wherever they're lying, in cupboard or shelf, END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis he will take care of your playthings himself! END
BEGIN NOW O it's I that am the captain of a tidy little ship, END
BEGIN NOW Of a ship that goes a sailing on the pond; END
BEGIN NOW And my ship it keeps a-turning all around and all about; END
BEGIN NOW But when I'm a little older, I shall find the secret out END
BEGIN NOW How to send my vessel sailing on beyond. END
BEGIN NOW For I mean to grow as little as the dolly at the helm, END
BEGIN NOW And the dolly I intend to come alive; END
BEGIN NOW And with him beside to help me, it's a-sailing I shall go, END
BEGIN NOW It's a-sailing on the water, when the jolly breezes blow END
BEGIN NOW And the vessel goes a divie-divie-dive. END
BEGIN NOW For beside the dolly sailor, I'm to voyage and explore, END
BEGIN NOW To land upon the island where no dolly was before, END
BEGIN NOW And to fire the penny cannon in the bow. END
BEGIN NOW Down by a shining water well END
BEGIN NOW I found a very little dell, END
BEGIN NOW No higher than my head. END
BEGIN NOW The heather and the gorse about END
BEGIN NOW In summer bloom were coming out, END
BEGIN NOW Some yellow and some red. END
BEGIN NOW I called the little pool a sea; END
BEGIN NOW The little hills were big to me; END
BEGIN NOW For I am very small. END
BEGIN NOW I made a boat, I made a town, END
BEGIN NOW I searched the caverns up and down, END
BEGIN NOW And named them one and all. END
BEGIN NOW And all about was mine, I said, END
BEGIN NOW The little sparrows overhead, END
BEGIN NOW The little minnows too. END
BEGIN NOW This was the world and I was king; END
BEGIN NOW For me the bees came by to sing, END
BEGIN NOW For me the swallows flew. END
BEGIN NOW I played there were no deeper seas, END
BEGIN NOW Nor any wider plains than these, END
BEGIN NOW Nor other kings than me. END
BEGIN NOW At last I heard my mother call END
BEGIN NOW Out from the house at evenfall, END
BEGIN NOW To call me home to tea. END
BEGIN NOW And I must rise and leave my dell, END
BEGIN NOW And leave my dimpled water well, END
BEGIN NOW And leave my heather blooms. END
BEGIN NOW Alas! and as my home I neared, END
BEGIN NOW How very big my nurse appeared. END
BEGIN NOW How great and cool the rooms! END
BEGIN NOW Summer fading, winter comes-- END
BEGIN NOW Frosty mornings, tingling thumbs, END
BEGIN NOW Window robins, winter rooks, END
BEGIN NOW And the picture story-books. END
BEGIN NOW Water now is turned to stone END
BEGIN NOW Nurse and I can walk upon; END
BEGIN NOW Still we find the flowing brooks END
BEGIN NOW In the picture story-books. END
BEGIN NOW All the pretty things put by, END
BEGIN NOW Wait upon the children's eye, END
BEGIN NOW Sheep and shepherds, trees and crooks, END
BEGIN NOW In the picture story-books. END
BEGIN NOW We may see how all things are END
BEGIN NOW Seas and cities, near and far, END
BEGIN NOW And the flying fairies' looks, END
BEGIN NOW In the picture story-books. END
BEGIN NOW How am I to sing your praise, END
BEGIN NOW Happy chimney-corner days, END
BEGIN NOW Sitting safe in nursery nooks, END
BEGIN NOW Reading picture story-books? END
BEGIN NOW These nuts, that I keep in the back of the nest, END
BEGIN NOW Where all my tin soldiers are lying at rest, END
BEGIN NOW Were gathered in Autumn by nursie and me END
BEGIN NOW In a wood with a well by the side of the sea. END
BEGIN NOW This whistle we made (and how clearly it sounds!) END
BEGIN NOW By the side of a field at the end of the grounds. END
BEGIN NOW Of a branch of a plane, with a knife of my own, END
BEGIN NOW It was nursie who made it, and nursie alone! END
BEGIN NOW The stone, with the white and the yellow and grey, END
BEGIN NOW We discovered I cannot tell HOW far away; END
BEGIN NOW And I carried it back although weary and cold, END
BEGIN NOW For though father denies it, I'm sure it is gold. END
BEGIN NOW But of all my treasures the last is the king, END
BEGIN NOW For there's very few children possess such a thing; END
BEGIN NOW And that is a chisel, both handle and blade, END
BEGIN NOW Which a man who was really a carpenter made. END
BEGIN NOW What are you able to build with your blocks? END
BEGIN NOW Castles and palaces, temples and docks. END
BEGIN NOW Rain may keep raining, and others go roam, END
BEGIN NOW But I can be happy and building at home. END
BEGIN NOW Let the sofa be mountains, the carpet be sea, END
BEGIN NOW There I'll establish a city for me: END
BEGIN NOW A kirk and a mill and a palace beside, END
BEGIN NOW And a harbour as well where my vessels may ride. END
BEGIN NOW Great is the palace with pillar and wall, END
BEGIN NOW A sort of a tower on the top of it all, END
BEGIN NOW And steps coming down in an orderly way END
BEGIN NOW To where my toy vessels lie safe in the bay. END
BEGIN NOW This one is sailing and that one is moored: END
BEGIN NOW Hark to the song of the sailors aboard! END
BEGIN NOW And see, on the steps of my palace, the kings END
BEGIN NOW Coming and going with presents and things! END
BEGIN NOW Now I have done with it, down let it go! END
BEGIN NOW All in a moment the town is laid low. END
BEGIN NOW Block upon block lying scattered and free, END
BEGIN NOW What is there left of my town by the sea? END
BEGIN NOW Yet as I saw it, I see it again, END
BEGIN NOW The kirk and the palace, the ships and the men, END
BEGIN NOW And as long as I live and where'er I may be, END
BEGIN NOW I'll always remember my town by the sea. END
BEGIN NOW At evening when the lamp is lit, END
BEGIN NOW Around the fire my parents sit; END
BEGIN NOW They sit at home and talk and sing, END
BEGIN NOW And do not play at anything. END
BEGIN NOW Now, with my little gun, I crawl END
BEGIN NOW All in the dark along the wall, END
BEGIN NOW And follow round the forest track END
BEGIN NOW Away behind the sofa back. END
BEGIN NOW There, in the night, where none can spy, END
BEGIN NOW All in my hunter's camp I lie, END
BEGIN NOW And play at books that I have read END
BEGIN NOW Till it is time to go to bed. END
BEGIN NOW These are the hills, these are the woods, END
BEGIN NOW These are my starry solitudes; END
BEGIN NOW And there the river by whose brink END
BEGIN NOW The roaring lions come to drink. END
BEGIN NOW I see the others far away END
BEGIN NOW As if in firelit camp they lay, END
BEGIN NOW And I, like to an Indian scout, END
BEGIN NOW Around their party prowled about. END
BEGIN NOW So when my nurse comes in for me, END
BEGIN NOW Home I return across the sea, END
BEGIN NOW And go to bed with backward looks END
BEGIN NOW At my dear land of Story-books. END
BEGIN NOW The lamps now glitter down the street; END
BEGIN NOW Faintly sound the falling feet; END
BEGIN NOW And the blue even slowly falls END
BEGIN NOW About the garden trees and walls. END
BEGIN NOW Now in the falling of the gloom END
BEGIN NOW The red fire paints the empty room: END
BEGIN NOW And warmly on the roof it looks, END
BEGIN NOW And flickers on the back of books. END
BEGIN NOW Armies march by tower and spire END
BEGIN NOW Of cities blazing, in the fire;-- END
BEGIN NOW Till as I gaze with staring eyes, END
BEGIN NOW The armies fade, the lustre dies. END
BEGIN NOW Then once again the glow returns; END
BEGIN NOW Again the phantom city burns; END
BEGIN NOW And down the red-hot valley, lo! END
BEGIN NOW The phantom armies marching go! END
BEGIN NOW Blinking embers, tell me true END
BEGIN NOW Where are those armies marching to, END
BEGIN NOW And what the burning city is END
BEGIN NOW That crumbles in your furnaces! END
BEGIN NOW When at home alone I sit END
BEGIN NOW And am very tired of it, END
BEGIN NOW I have just to shut my eyes END
BEGIN NOW To go sailing through the skies-- END
BEGIN NOW To go sailing far away END
BEGIN NOW To the pleasant Land of Play; END
BEGIN NOW To the fairy land afar END
BEGIN NOW Where the Little People are; END
BEGIN NOW Where the clover-tops are trees, END
BEGIN NOW And the rain-pools are the seas, END
BEGIN NOW And the leaves, like little ships, END
BEGIN NOW Sail about on tiny trips; END
BEGIN NOW And above the Daisy tree END
BEGIN NOW Through the grasses, END
BEGIN NOW High o'erhead the Bumble Bee END
BEGIN NOW Hums and passes. END
BEGIN NOW In that forest to and fro END
BEGIN NOW I can wander, I can go; END
BEGIN NOW See the spider and the fly, END
BEGIN NOW And the ants go marching by, END
BEGIN NOW Carrying parcels with their feet END
BEGIN NOW Down the green and grassy street. END
BEGIN NOW I can in the sorrel sit END
BEGIN NOW Where the ladybird alit. END
BEGIN NOW I can climb the jointed grass END
BEGIN NOW And on high END
BEGIN NOW See the greater swallows pass END
BEGIN NOW In the sky, END
BEGIN NOW And the round sun rolling by END
BEGIN NOW Heeding no such things as I. END
BEGIN NOW Through that forest I can pass END
BEGIN NOW Till, as in a looking-glass, END
BEGIN NOW Humming fly and daisy tree END
BEGIN NOW And my tiny self I see, END
BEGIN NOW Painted very clear and neat END
BEGIN NOW On the rain-pool at my feet. END
BEGIN NOW Should a leaflet come to land END
BEGIN NOW Drifting near to where I stand, END
BEGIN NOW Straight I'll board that tiny boat END
BEGIN NOW Round the rain-pool sea to float. END
BEGIN NOW Little thoughtful creatures sit END
BEGIN NOW On the grassy coasts of it; END
BEGIN NOW Little things with lovely eyes END
BEGIN NOW See me sailing with surprise. END
BEGIN NOW Some are clad in armour green-- END
BEGIN NOW (These have sure to battle been!)-- END
BEGIN NOW Some are pied with ev'ry hue, END
BEGIN NOW Black and crimson, gold and blue; END
BEGIN NOW Some have wings and swift are gone;-- END
BEGIN NOW But they all look kindly on. END
BEGIN NOW When my eyes I once again END
BEGIN NOW Open, and see all things plain: END
BEGIN NOW High bare walls, great bare floor; END
BEGIN NOW Great big knobs on drawer and door; END
BEGIN NOW Great big people perched on chairs, END
BEGIN NOW Stitching tucks and mending tears, END
BEGIN NOW Each a hill that I could climb, END
BEGIN NOW And talking nonsense all the time-- END
BEGIN NOW O dear me, END
BEGIN NOW That I could be END
BEGIN NOW A sailor on a the rain-pool sea, END
BEGIN NOW A climber in the clover tree, END
BEGIN NOW And just come back a sleepy-head, END
BEGIN NOW Late at night to go to bed. END
BEGIN NOW When the golden day is done, END
BEGIN NOW Through the closing portal, END
BEGIN NOW Child and garden, flower and sun, END
BEGIN NOW Vanish all things mortal. END
BEGIN NOW As the building shadows fall END
BEGIN NOW As the rays diminish, END
BEGIN NOW Under evening's cloak they all END
BEGIN NOW Roll away and vanish. END
BEGIN NOW Garden darkened, daisy shut, END
BEGIN NOW Child in bed, they slumber-- END
BEGIN NOW Glow-worm in the hallway rut, END
BEGIN NOW Mice among the lumber. END
BEGIN NOW In the darkness houses shine, END
BEGIN NOW Parents move the candles; END
BEGIN NOW Till on all the night divine END
BEGIN NOW Turns the bedroom handles. END
BEGIN NOW Till at last the day begins END
BEGIN NOW In the east a-breaking, END
BEGIN NOW In the hedges and the whins END
BEGIN NOW Sleeping birds a-waking. END
BEGIN NOW In the darkness shapes of things, END
BEGIN NOW Houses, trees and hedges, END
BEGIN NOW Clearer grow; and sparrow's wings END
BEGIN NOW Beat on window ledges. END
BEGIN NOW These shall wake the yawning maid; END
BEGIN NOW She the door shall open-- END
BEGIN NOW Finding dew on garden glade END
BEGIN NOW And the morning broken. END
BEGIN NOW There my garden grows again END
BEGIN NOW Green and rosy painted, END
BEGIN NOW As at eve behind the pane END
BEGIN NOW From my eyes it fainted. END
BEGIN NOW Just as it was shut away, END
BEGIN NOW Toy-like, in the even, END
BEGIN NOW Here I see it glow with day END
BEGIN NOW Under glowing heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Every path and every plot, END
BEGIN NOW Every blush of roses, END
BEGIN NOW Every blue forget-me-not END
BEGIN NOW Where the dew reposes, END
BEGIN NOW Up! they cry, "the day is come END
BEGIN NOW On the smiling valleys: END
BEGIN NOW We have beat the morning drum; END
BEGIN NOW Playmate, join your allies! END
BEGIN NOW Birds all the sunny day END
BEGIN NOW Flutter and quarrel END
BEGIN NOW Here in the arbour-like END
BEGIN NOW Tent of the laurel. END
BEGIN NOW Here in the fork END
BEGIN NOW The brown nest is seated; END
BEGIN NOW Four little blue eggs END
BEGIN NOW The mother keeps heated. END
BEGIN NOW While we stand watching her END
BEGIN NOW Staring like gabies, END
BEGIN NOW Safe in each egg are the END
BEGIN NOW Bird's little babies. END
BEGIN NOW Soon the frail eggs they shall END
BEGIN NOW Chip, and upspringing END
BEGIN NOW Make all the April woods END
BEGIN NOW Merry with singing. END
BEGIN NOW Younger than we are, END
BEGIN NOW O children, and frailer, END
BEGIN NOW Soon in the blue air they'll be, END
BEGIN NOW Singer and sailor. END
BEGIN NOW We, so much older, END
BEGIN NOW Taller and stronger, END
BEGIN NOW We shall look down on the END
BEGIN NOW Birdies no longer. END
BEGIN NOW They shall go flying END
BEGIN NOW With musical speeches END
BEGIN NOW High overhead in the END
BEGIN NOW Tops of the beeches. END
BEGIN NOW In spite of our wisdom END
BEGIN NOW And sensible talking, END
BEGIN NOW We on our feet must go END
BEGIN NOW Plodding and walking. END
BEGIN NOW All the names I know from nurse: END
BEGIN NOW Gardener's garters, Shepherd's purse, END
BEGIN NOW Bachelor's buttons, Lady's smock, END
BEGIN NOW Fairy places, fairy things, END
BEGIN NOW Fairy woods where the wild bee wings, END
BEGIN NOW Tiny trees for tiny dames-- END
BEGIN NOW These must all be fairy names! END
BEGIN NOW Tiny woods below whose boughs END
BEGIN NOW Shady fairies weave a house; END
BEGIN NOW Tiny tree-tops, rose or thyme, END
BEGIN NOW Where the braver fairies climb! END
BEGIN NOW Fair are grown-up people's trees, END
BEGIN NOW But the fairest woods are these; END
BEGIN NOW Where, if I were not so tall, END
BEGIN NOW I should live for good and all. END
BEGIN NOW Great is the sun, and wide he goes END
BEGIN NOW Through empty heaven with repose; END
BEGIN NOW And in the blue and glowing days END
BEGIN NOW More thick than rain he showers his rays. END
BEGIN NOW Though closer still the blinds we pull END
BEGIN NOW To keep the shady parlour cool, END
BEGIN NOW To slip his golden fingers through. END
BEGIN NOW The dusty attic spider-clad END
BEGIN NOW He, through the keyhole, maketh glad; END
BEGIN NOW And through the broken edge of tiles END
BEGIN NOW Into the laddered hay-loft smiles. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime his golden face around END
BEGIN NOW He bares to all the garden ground, END
BEGIN NOW And sheds a warm and glittering look END
BEGIN NOW Among the ivy's inmost nook. END
BEGIN NOW Above the hills, along the blue, END
BEGIN NOW Round the bright air with footing true, END
BEGIN NOW To please the child, to paint the rose, END
BEGIN NOW The gardener of the World, he goes. END
BEGIN NOW When the grass was closely mown, END
BEGIN NOW Walking on the lawn alone, END
BEGIN NOW In the turf a hole I found, END
BEGIN NOW And hid a soldier underground. END
BEGIN NOW Spring and daisies came apace; END
BEGIN NOW Grasses hide my hiding place; END
BEGIN NOW Grasses run like a green sea END
BEGIN NOW O'er the lawn up to my knee. END
BEGIN NOW Under grass alone he lies, END
BEGIN NOW Looking up with leaden eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Scarlet coat and pointed gun, END
BEGIN NOW To the stars and to the sun. END
BEGIN NOW When the grass is ripe like grain, END
BEGIN NOW When the scythe is stoned again, END
BEGIN NOW When the lawn is shaven clear, END
BEGIN NOW Then my hole shall reappear. END
BEGIN NOW I shall find him, never fear, END
BEGIN NOW I shall find my grenadier; END
BEGIN NOW But for all that's gone and come, END
BEGIN NOW He has lived, a little thing, END
BEGIN NOW In the grassy woods of spring; END
BEGIN NOW Done, if he could tell me true, END
BEGIN NOW Just as I should like to do. END
BEGIN NOW He has seen the starry hours END
BEGIN NOW And the springing of the flowers; END
BEGIN NOW And the fairy things that pass END
BEGIN NOW In the forests of the grass. END
BEGIN NOW In the silence he has heard END
BEGIN NOW Talking bee and ladybird, END
BEGIN NOW And the butterfly has flown END
BEGIN NOW O'er him as he lay alone. END
BEGIN NOW Not a word will he disclose, END
BEGIN NOW Not a word of all he knows. END
BEGIN NOW I must lay him on the shelf, END
BEGIN NOW And make up the tale myself. END
BEGIN NOW In the other gardens END
BEGIN NOW And all up the vale, END
BEGIN NOW From the autumn bonfires END
BEGIN NOW See the smoke trail! END
BEGIN NOW Pleasant summer over END
BEGIN NOW And all the summer flowers, END
BEGIN NOW The red fire blazes, END
BEGIN NOW The grey smoke towers. END
BEGIN NOW Sing a song of seasons! END
BEGIN NOW Something bright in all! END
BEGIN NOW Flowers in the summer, END
BEGIN NOW Fires in the fall! END
BEGIN NOW The gardener does not love to talk. END
BEGIN NOW He makes me keep the gravel walk; END
BEGIN NOW And when he puts his tools away, END
BEGIN NOW He locks the door and takes the key. END
BEGIN NOW Away behind the currant row, END
BEGIN NOW Where no one else but cook may go, END
BEGIN NOW Far in the plots, I see him dig, END
BEGIN NOW Old and serious, brown and big. END
BEGIN NOW He digs the flowers, green, red, and blue, END
BEGIN NOW Nor wishes to be spoken to. END
BEGIN NOW He digs the flowers and cuts the hay, END
BEGIN NOW And never seems to want to play. END
BEGIN NOW Silly gardener! summer goes, END
BEGIN NOW And winter comes with pinching toes, END
BEGIN NOW When in the garden bare and brown END
BEGIN NOW You must lay your barrow down. END
BEGIN NOW Well now, and while the summer stays, END
BEGIN NOW To profit by these garden days END
BEGIN NOW O how much wiser you would be END
BEGIN NOW To play at Indian wars with me! END
BEGIN NOW Dear Uncle Jim, this garden ground END
BEGIN NOW That now you smoke your pipe around, END
BEGIN NOW Has seen immortal actions done END
BEGIN NOW And valiant battles lost and won. END
BEGIN NOW Here we had best on tip-toe tread, END
BEGIN NOW While I for safety march ahead, END
BEGIN NOW For this is that enchanted ground END
BEGIN NOW Where all who loiter slumber sound. END
BEGIN NOW Here is the sea, here is the sand, END
BEGIN NOW Here is simple Shepherd's Land, END
BEGIN NOW Here are the fairy hollyhocks, END
BEGIN NOW And there are Ali Baba's rocks. END
BEGIN NOW But yonder, see! apart and high, END
BEGIN NOW Frozen Siberia lies; where I, END
BEGIN NOW Was bound by an enchanter's spell. END
BEGIN NOW If two may read aright END
BEGIN NOW These rhymes of old delight END
BEGIN NOW And house and garden play, END
BEGIN NOW You two, my cousins, and you only, may. END
BEGIN NOW You in a garden green END
BEGIN NOW With me were king and queen, END
BEGIN NOW Were hunter, soldier, tar, END
BEGIN NOW And all the thousand things that children are. END
BEGIN NOW Now in the elders' seat END
BEGIN NOW We rest with quiet feet, END
BEGIN NOW And from the window-bay END
BEGIN NOW We watch the children, our successors, play. END
BEGIN NOW Time was," the golden head END
BEGIN NOW Irrevocably said; END
BEGIN NOW But time which one can bind, END
BEGIN NOW While flowing fast away, leaves love behind. END
BEGIN NOW You too, my mother, read my rhymes END
BEGIN NOW For love of unforgotten times, END
BEGIN NOW And you may chance to hear once more END
BEGIN NOW The little feet along the floor. END
BEGIN NOW Chief of our aunts"--not only I, END
BEGIN NOW But all your dozen of nurselings cry-- END
BEGIN NOW What did the other children do? END
BEGIN NOW And what were childhood, wanting you? END
BEGIN NOW The red room with the giant bed END
BEGIN NOW Where none but elders laid their head; END
BEGIN NOW The little room where you and I END
BEGIN NOW Did for awhile together lie END
BEGIN NOW And, simple suitor, I your hand END
BEGIN NOW In decent marriage did demand; END
BEGIN NOW The great day nursery, best of all, END
BEGIN NOW With pictures pasted on the wall END
BEGIN NOW And leaves upon the blind-- END
BEGIN NOW A pleasant room wherein to wake END
BEGIN NOW And hear the leafy garden shake END
BEGIN NOW And rustle in the wind-- END
BEGIN NOW And pleasant there to lie in bed END
BEGIN NOW And see the pictures overhead-- END
BEGIN NOW The wars about Sebastopol, END
BEGIN NOW The grinning guns along the wall, END
BEGIN NOW The daring escalade, END
BEGIN NOW The plunging ships, the bleating sheep, END
BEGIN NOW The happy children ankle-deep END
BEGIN NOW And laughing as they wade: END
BEGIN NOW All these are vanished clean away, END
BEGIN NOW And the old manse is changed to-day; END
BEGIN NOW It wears an altered face END
BEGIN NOW And shields a stranger race. END
BEGIN NOW The river, on from mill to mill, END
BEGIN NOW Flows past our childhood's garden still; END
BEGIN NOW But ah! we children never more END
BEGIN NOW Shall watch it from the water-door! END
BEGIN NOW Below the yew--it still is there-- END
BEGIN NOW Our phantom voices haunt the air END
BEGIN NOW As we were still at play, END
BEGIN NOW And I can hear them call and say: END
BEGIN NOW Ah, far enough, my dear, END
BEGIN NOW Far, far enough from here-- END
BEGIN NOW Yet you have farther gone! END
BEGIN NOW Can I get there by candlelight? END
BEGIN NOW So goes the old refrain. END
BEGIN NOW I do not know--perchance you might-- END
BEGIN NOW But only, children, hear it right, END
BEGIN NOW Ah, never to return again! END
BEGIN NOW The eternal dawn, beyond a doubt, END
BEGIN NOW Shall break on hill and plain, END
BEGIN NOW And put all stars and candles out END
BEGIN NOW Ere we be young again. END
BEGIN NOW To you in distant India, these END
BEGIN NOW I send across the seas, END
BEGIN NOW Nor count it far across. END
BEGIN NOW For which of us forgets END
BEGIN NOW The Indian cabinets, END
BEGIN NOW The bones of antelope, the wings of albatross, END
BEGIN NOW The pied and painted birds and beans, END
BEGIN NOW The junks and bangles, beads and screens, END
BEGIN NOW The gods and sacred bells, END
BEGIN NOW And the loud-humming, twisted shells! END
BEGIN NOW The level of the parlour floor END
BEGIN NOW Was honest, homely, Scottish shore; END
BEGIN NOW But when we climbed upon a chair, END
BEGIN NOW Behold the gorgeous East was there! END
BEGIN NOW Be this a fable; and behold END
BEGIN NOW Me in the parlour as of old, END
BEGIN NOW And Minnie just above me set END
BEGIN NOW In the quaint Indian cabinet! END
BEGIN NOW Smiling and kind, you grace a shelf END
BEGIN NOW Too high for me to reach myself. END
BEGIN NOW Reach down a hand, my dear, and take END
BEGIN NOW These rhymes for old acquaintance' sake! END
BEGIN NOW Then you shall discover, that your name was printed down END
BEGIN NOW By the English printers, long before, in London town. END
BEGIN NOW In the great and busy city where the East and West are met, END
BEGIN NOW All the little letters did the English printer set; END
BEGIN NOW While you thought of nothing, and were still too young to play, END
BEGIN NOW Foreign people thought of you in places far away. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, and when you slept, a baby, over all the English lands END
BEGIN NOW Other little children took the volume in their hands; END
BEGIN NOW Other children questioned, in their homes across the seas: END
BEGIN NOW Who was little Louis, won't you tell us, mother, please? END
BEGIN NOW Now that you have spelt your lesson, lay it down and go and play, END
BEGIN NOW Watching all the mighty whalebones, lying buried by the breeze, END
BEGIN NOW Tiny sandy-pipers, and the huge Pacific seas. END
BEGIN NOW And remember in your playing, as the sea-fog rolls to you, END
BEGIN NOW Long ere you could read it, how I told you what to do; END
BEGIN NOW And that while you thought of no one, nearly half the world away END
BEGIN NOW Some one thought of Louis on the beach of Monterey! END
BEGIN NOW As from the house your mother sees END
BEGIN NOW You playing round the garden trees, END
BEGIN NOW So you may see, if you will look END
BEGIN NOW Through the windows of this book, END
BEGIN NOW Another child, far, far away, END
BEGIN NOW And in another garden, play. END
BEGIN NOW But do not think you can at all, END
BEGIN NOW By knocking on the window, call END
BEGIN NOW That child to hear you. He intent END
BEGIN NOW Is all on his play-business bent. END
BEGIN NOW He does not hear, he will not look, END
BEGIN NOW Nor yet be lured out of this book. END
BEGIN NOW For, long ago, the truth to say, END
BEGIN NOW He has grown up and gone away, END
BEGIN NOW And it is but a child of air END
BEGIN NOW That lingers in the garden there. END
BEGIN NOW It is an ancient Mariner, END
BEGIN NOW And he stoppeth one of three. END
BEGIN NOW By thy long grey beard and glittering eye, END
BEGIN NOW Now wherefore stopp'st thou me? END
BEGIN NOW The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide, END
BEGIN NOW And I am next of kin; END
BEGIN NOW The guests are met, the feast is set: END
BEGIN NOW May'st hear the merry din. END
BEGIN NOW He holds him with his skinny hand, END
BEGIN NOW There was a ship," quoth he. END
BEGIN NOW Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon! END
BEGIN NOW Eftsoons his hand dropt he. END
BEGIN NOW He holds him with his glittering eye-- END
BEGIN NOW The Wedding-Guest stood still, END
BEGIN NOW And listens like a three years child: END
BEGIN NOW The Mariner hath his will. END
BEGIN NOW The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone: END
BEGIN NOW He cannot chuse but hear; END
BEGIN NOW And thus spake on that ancient man, END
BEGIN NOW The bright-eyed Mariner. END
BEGIN NOW The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared, END
BEGIN NOW Merrily did we drop END
BEGIN NOW Below the kirk, below the hill, END
BEGIN NOW Below the light-house top. END
BEGIN NOW The Sun came up upon the left, END
BEGIN NOW Out of the sea came he! END
BEGIN NOW And he shone bright, and on the right END
BEGIN NOW Went down into the sea. END
BEGIN NOW Higher and higher every day, END
BEGIN NOW Till over the mast at noon-- END
BEGIN NOW The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast, END
BEGIN NOW For he heard the loud bassoon. END
BEGIN NOW The bride hath paced into the hall, END
BEGIN NOW Red as a rose is she; END
BEGIN NOW Nodding their heads before her goes END
BEGIN NOW The merry minstrelsy. END
BEGIN NOW The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast, END
BEGIN NOW Yet he cannot chuse but hear; END
BEGIN NOW And thus spake on that ancient man, END
BEGIN NOW The bright-eyed Mariner. END
BEGIN NOW And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he END
BEGIN NOW Was tyrannous and strong: END
BEGIN NOW He struck with his o'ertaking wings, END
BEGIN NOW And chased south along. END
BEGIN NOW With sloping masts and dipping prow, END
BEGIN NOW As who pursued with yell and blow END
BEGIN NOW Still treads the shadow of his foe END
BEGIN NOW And forward bends his head, END
BEGIN NOW The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast, END
BEGIN NOW And southward aye we fled. END
BEGIN NOW And now there came both mist and snow, END
BEGIN NOW And it grew wondrous cold: END
BEGIN NOW And ice, mast-high, came floating by, END
BEGIN NOW As green as emerald. END
BEGIN NOW And through the drifts the snowy clifts END
BEGIN NOW Did send a dismal sheen: END
BEGIN NOW Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken-- END
BEGIN NOW The ice was all between. END
BEGIN NOW The ice was here, the ice was there, END
BEGIN NOW The ice was all around: END
BEGIN NOW It cracked and growled, and roared and howled, END
BEGIN NOW Like noises in a swound! END
BEGIN NOW At length did cross an Albatross: END
BEGIN NOW Thorough the fog it came; END
BEGIN NOW As if it had been a Christian soul, END
BEGIN NOW We hailed it in God's name. END
BEGIN NOW It ate the food it ne'er had eat, END
BEGIN NOW And round and round it flew. END
BEGIN NOW The ice did split with a thunder-fit; END
BEGIN NOW The helmsman steered us through! END
BEGIN NOW And a good south wind sprung up behind; END
BEGIN NOW The Albatross did follow, END
BEGIN NOW And every day, for food or play, END
BEGIN NOW Came to the mariners' hollo! END
BEGIN NOW In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud, END
BEGIN NOW It perched for vespers nine; END
BEGIN NOW Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white, END
BEGIN NOW Glimmered the white Moon-shine. END
BEGIN NOW God save thee, ancient Mariner! END
BEGIN NOW From the fiends, that plague thee thus!-- END
BEGIN NOW Why look'st thou so?"--With my cross-bow END
BEGIN NOW I shot the ALBATROSS. END
BEGIN NOW The Sun now rose upon the right: END
BEGIN NOW Out of the sea came he, END
BEGIN NOW Still hid in mist, and on the left END
BEGIN NOW Went down into the sea. END
BEGIN NOW And the good south wind still blew behind END
BEGIN NOW But no sweet bird did follow, END
BEGIN NOW Nor any day for food or play END
BEGIN NOW Came to the mariners' hollo! END
BEGIN NOW And I had done an hellish thing, END
BEGIN NOW And it would work 'em woe: END
BEGIN NOW For all averred, I had killed the bird END
BEGIN NOW That made the breeze to blow. END
BEGIN NOW Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay END
BEGIN NOW That made the breeze to blow! END
BEGIN NOW Nor dim nor red, like God's own head, END
BEGIN NOW The glorious Sun uprist: END
BEGIN NOW Then all averred, I had killed the bird END
BEGIN NOW That brought the fog and mist. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay, END
BEGIN NOW That bring the fog and mist. END
BEGIN NOW The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew, END
BEGIN NOW The furrow followed free: END
BEGIN NOW We were the first that ever burst END
BEGIN NOW Into that silent sea. END
BEGIN NOW Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down, END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas sad as sad could be; END
BEGIN NOW And we did speak only to break END
BEGIN NOW The silence of the sea! END
BEGIN NOW All in a hot and copper sky, END
BEGIN NOW The bloody Sun, at noon, END
BEGIN NOW Right up above the mast did stand, END
BEGIN NOW No bigger than the Moon. END
BEGIN NOW Day after day, day after day, END
BEGIN NOW We stuck, nor breath nor motion; END
BEGIN NOW As idle as a painted ship END
BEGIN NOW Upon a painted ocean. END
BEGIN NOW Water, water, every where, END
BEGIN NOW And all the boards did shrink; END
BEGIN NOW Water, water, every where, END
BEGIN NOW Nor any drop to drink. END
BEGIN NOW The very deep did rot: O Christ! END
BEGIN NOW That ever this should be! END
BEGIN NOW Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs END
BEGIN NOW Upon the slimy sea. END
BEGIN NOW About, about, in reel and rout END
BEGIN NOW The death-fires danced at night; END
BEGIN NOW The water, like a witch's oils, END
BEGIN NOW Burnt green, and blue and white. END
BEGIN NOW And some in dreams assured were END
BEGIN NOW Of the spirit that plagued us so: END
BEGIN NOW Nine fathom deep he had followed us END
BEGIN NOW From the land of mist and snow. END
BEGIN NOW And every tongue, through utter drought, END
BEGIN NOW Was withered at the root; END
BEGIN NOW We could not speak, no more than if END
BEGIN NOW We had been choked with soot. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! well a-day! what evil looks END
BEGIN NOW Had I from old and young! END
BEGIN NOW Instead of the cross, the Albatross END
BEGIN NOW About my neck was hung. END
BEGIN NOW There passed a weary time. Each throat END
BEGIN NOW Was parched, and glazed each eye. END
BEGIN NOW A weary time! a weary time! END
BEGIN NOW How glazed each weary eye, END
BEGIN NOW When looking westward, I beheld END
BEGIN NOW A something in the sky. END
BEGIN NOW At first it seemed a little speck, END
BEGIN NOW And then it seemed a mist: END
BEGIN NOW It moved and moved, and took at last END
BEGIN NOW A certain shape, I wist. END
BEGIN NOW A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist! END
BEGIN NOW And still it neared and neared: END
BEGIN NOW As if it dodged a water-sprite, END
BEGIN NOW It plunged and tacked and veered. END
BEGIN NOW With throats unslaked, with black lips baked, END
BEGIN NOW We could not laugh nor wail; END
BEGIN NOW I bit my arm, I sucked the blood, END
BEGIN NOW And cried, A sail! a sail! END
BEGIN NOW With throats unslaked, with black lips baked, END
BEGIN NOW Agape they heard me call: END
BEGIN NOW Gramercy! they for joy did grin, END
BEGIN NOW And all at once their breath drew in, END
BEGIN NOW As they were drinking all. END
BEGIN NOW See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more! END
BEGIN NOW Hither to work us weal; END
BEGIN NOW Without a breeze, without a tide, END
BEGIN NOW She steadies with upright keel! END
BEGIN NOW The western wave was all a-flame END
BEGIN NOW The day was well nigh done! END
BEGIN NOW Almost upon the western wave END
BEGIN NOW Rested the broad bright Sun; END
BEGIN NOW When that strange shape drove suddenly END
BEGIN NOW And straight the Sun was flecked with bars, END
BEGIN NOW (Heaven's Mother send us grace!) END
BEGIN NOW As if through a dungeon-grate he peered, END
BEGIN NOW With broad and burning face. END
BEGIN NOW Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud) END
BEGIN NOW How fast she nears and nears! END
BEGIN NOW Are those her sails that glance in the Sun, END
BEGIN NOW Like restless gossameres! END
BEGIN NOW Are those her ribs through which the Sun END
BEGIN NOW Did peer, as through a grate? END
BEGIN NOW And is that Woman all her crew? END
BEGIN NOW Is that a DEATH? and are there two? END
BEGIN NOW Is DEATH that woman's mate? END
BEGIN NOW Her lips were red, her looks were free, END
BEGIN NOW Her locks were yellow as gold: END
BEGIN NOW Her skin was as white as leprosy, END
BEGIN NOW The Night-Mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she, END
BEGIN NOW Who thicks man's blood with cold. END
BEGIN NOW The naked hulk alongside came, END
BEGIN NOW And the twain were casting dice; END
BEGIN NOW The game is done! I've won! I've won! END
BEGIN NOW Quoth she, and whistles thrice. END
BEGIN NOW The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out: END
BEGIN NOW At one stride comes the dark; END
BEGIN NOW With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea. END
BEGIN NOW Off shot the spectre-bark. END
BEGIN NOW We listened and looked sideways up! END
BEGIN NOW Fear at my heart, as at a cup, END
BEGIN NOW My life-blood seemed to sip! END
BEGIN NOW The stars were dim, and thick the night, END
BEGIN NOW The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white; END
BEGIN NOW From the sails the dew did drip-- END
BEGIN NOW Till clombe above the eastern bar END
BEGIN NOW The horned Moon, with one bright star END
BEGIN NOW Within the nether tip. END
BEGIN NOW One after one, by the star-dogged Moon END
BEGIN NOW Too quick for groan or sigh, END
BEGIN NOW Each turned his face with a ghastly pang, END
BEGIN NOW And cursed me with his eye. END
BEGIN NOW Four times fifty living men, END
BEGIN NOW (And I heard nor sigh nor groan) END
BEGIN NOW With heavy thump, a lifeless lump, END
BEGIN NOW They dropped down one by one. END
BEGIN NOW The souls did from their bodies fly,-- END
BEGIN NOW They fled to bliss or woe! END
BEGIN NOW And every soul, it passed me by, END
BEGIN NOW Like the whizz of my CROSS-BOW! END
BEGIN NOW I fear thee, ancient Mariner! END
BEGIN NOW I fear thy skinny hand! END
BEGIN NOW And thou art long, and lank, and brown, END
BEGIN NOW As is the ribbed sea-sand. END
BEGIN NOW I fear thee and thy glittering eye, END
BEGIN NOW And thy skinny hand, so brown."-- END
BEGIN NOW Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest! END
BEGIN NOW This body dropt not down. END
BEGIN NOW Alone, alone, all, all alone, END
BEGIN NOW Alone on a wide wide sea! END
BEGIN NOW And never a saint took pity on END
BEGIN NOW My soul in agony. END
BEGIN NOW The many men, so beautiful! END
BEGIN NOW And they all dead did lie: END
BEGIN NOW And a thousand thousand slimy things END
BEGIN NOW I looked upon the rotting sea, END
BEGIN NOW And drew my eyes away; END
BEGIN NOW I looked upon the rotting deck, END
BEGIN NOW And there the dead men lay. END
BEGIN NOW I looked to Heaven, and tried to pray: END
BEGIN NOW But or ever a prayer had gusht, END
BEGIN NOW A wicked whisper came, and made END
BEGIN NOW my heart as dry as dust. END
BEGIN NOW I closed my lids, and kept them close, END
BEGIN NOW And the balls like pulses beat; END
BEGIN NOW For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky END
BEGIN NOW Lay like a load on my weary eye, END
BEGIN NOW And the dead were at my feet. END
BEGIN NOW The cold sweat melted from their limbs, END
BEGIN NOW Nor rot nor reek did they: END
BEGIN NOW The look with which they looked on me END
BEGIN NOW Had never passed away. END
BEGIN NOW An orphan's curse would drag to Hell END
BEGIN NOW A spirit from on high; END
BEGIN NOW But oh! more horrible than that END
BEGIN NOW Is a curse in a dead man's eye! END
BEGIN NOW Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse, END
BEGIN NOW And yet I could not die. END
BEGIN NOW The moving Moon went up the sky, END
BEGIN NOW And no where did abide: END
BEGIN NOW Softly she was going up, END
BEGIN NOW And a star or two beside. END
BEGIN NOW Her beams bemocked the sultry main, END
BEGIN NOW Like April hoar-frost spread; END
BEGIN NOW But where the ship's huge shadow lay, END
BEGIN NOW The charmed water burnt alway END
BEGIN NOW A still and awful red. END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the shadow of the ship, END
BEGIN NOW I watched the water-snakes: END
BEGIN NOW They moved in tracks of shining white, END
BEGIN NOW And when they reared, the elfish light END
BEGIN NOW Fell off in hoary flakes. END
BEGIN NOW Within the shadow of the ship END
BEGIN NOW I watched their rich attire: END
BEGIN NOW Blue, glossy green, and velvet black, END
BEGIN NOW They coiled and swam; and every track END
BEGIN NOW Was a flash of golden fire. END
BEGIN NOW O happy living things! no tongue END
BEGIN NOW Their beauty might declare: END
BEGIN NOW A spring of love gushed from my heart, END
BEGIN NOW And I blessed them unaware: END
BEGIN NOW Sure my kind saint took pity on me, END
BEGIN NOW And I blessed them unaware. END
BEGIN NOW The self same moment I could pray; END
BEGIN NOW And from my neck so free END
BEGIN NOW The Albatross fell off, and sank END
BEGIN NOW Like lead into the sea. END
BEGIN NOW Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing, END
BEGIN NOW Beloved from pole to pole! END
BEGIN NOW To Mary Queen the praise be given! END
BEGIN NOW She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven, END
BEGIN NOW That slid into my soul. END
BEGIN NOW The silly buckets on the deck, END
BEGIN NOW That had so long remained, END
BEGIN NOW I dreamt that they were filled with dew; END
BEGIN NOW And when I awoke, it rained. END
BEGIN NOW My lips were wet, my throat was cold, END
BEGIN NOW My garments all were dank; END
BEGIN NOW Sure I had drunken in my dreams, END
BEGIN NOW And still my body drank. END
BEGIN NOW I moved, and could not feel my limbs: END
BEGIN NOW I was so light--almost END
BEGIN NOW I thought that I had died in sleep, END
BEGIN NOW And was a blessed ghost. END
BEGIN NOW And soon I heard a roaring wind: END
BEGIN NOW It did not come anear; END
BEGIN NOW But with its sound it shook the sails, END
BEGIN NOW That were so thin and sere. END
BEGIN NOW The upper air burst into life! END
BEGIN NOW And a hundred fire-flags sheen, END
BEGIN NOW To and fro they were hurried about! END
BEGIN NOW And to and fro, and in and out, END
BEGIN NOW The wan stars danced between. END
BEGIN NOW And the coming wind did roar more loud, END
BEGIN NOW And the sails did sigh like sedge; END
BEGIN NOW And the rain poured down from one black cloud; END
BEGIN NOW The Moon was at its edge. END
BEGIN NOW The thick black cloud was cleft, and still END
BEGIN NOW The Moon was at its side: END
BEGIN NOW Like waters shot from some high crag, END
BEGIN NOW The lightning fell with never a jag, END
BEGIN NOW A river steep and wide. END
BEGIN NOW The loud wind never reached the ship, END
BEGIN NOW Yet now the ship moved on! END
BEGIN NOW Beneath the lightning and the Moon END
BEGIN NOW The dead men gave a groan. END
BEGIN NOW They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose, END
BEGIN NOW Nor spake, nor moved their eyes; END
BEGIN NOW It had been strange, even in a dream, END
BEGIN NOW To have seen those dead men rise. END
BEGIN NOW The helmsman steered, the ship moved on; END
BEGIN NOW Yet never a breeze up blew; END
BEGIN NOW The mariners all 'gan work the ropes, END
BEGIN NOW Where they were wont to do: END
BEGIN NOW They raised their limbs like lifeless tools-- END
BEGIN NOW We were a ghastly crew. END
BEGIN NOW The body of my brother's son, END
BEGIN NOW Stood by me, knee to knee: END
BEGIN NOW The body and I pulled at one rope, END
BEGIN NOW But he said nought to me. END
BEGIN NOW I fear thee, ancient Mariner! END
BEGIN NOW Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest! END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas not those souls that fled in pain, END
BEGIN NOW Which to their corses came again, END
BEGIN NOW But a troop of spirits blest: END
BEGIN NOW For when it dawned--they dropped their arms, END
BEGIN NOW And clustered round the mast; END
BEGIN NOW Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths, END
BEGIN NOW And from their bodies passed. END
BEGIN NOW Around, around, flew each sweet sound, END
BEGIN NOW Then darted to the Sun; END
BEGIN NOW Slowly the sounds came back again, END
BEGIN NOW Now mixed, now one by one. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes a-dropping from the sky END
BEGIN NOW I heard the sky-lark sing; END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes all little birds that are, END
BEGIN NOW How they seemed to fill the sea and air END
BEGIN NOW With their sweet jargoning! END
BEGIN NOW And now 'twas like all instruments, END
BEGIN NOW Now like a lonely flute; END
BEGIN NOW And now it is an angel's song, END
BEGIN NOW That makes the Heavens be mute. END
BEGIN NOW It ceased; yet still the sails made on END
BEGIN NOW A pleasant noise till noon, END
BEGIN NOW A noise like of a hidden brook END
BEGIN NOW In the leafy month of June, END
BEGIN NOW That to the sleeping woods all night END
BEGIN NOW Singeth a quiet tune. END
BEGIN NOW Till noon we quietly sailed on, END
BEGIN NOW Yet never a breeze did breathe: END
BEGIN NOW Slowly and smoothly went the ship, END
BEGIN NOW Moved onward from beneath. END
BEGIN NOW Under the keel nine fathom deep, END
BEGIN NOW From the land of mist and snow, END
BEGIN NOW The spirit slid: and it was he END
BEGIN NOW That made the ship to go. END
BEGIN NOW The sails at noon left off their tune, END
BEGIN NOW And the ship stood still also. END
BEGIN NOW The Sun, right up above the mast, END
BEGIN NOW Had fixed her to the ocean: END
BEGIN NOW But in a minute she 'gan stir, END
BEGIN NOW With a short uneasy motion-- END
BEGIN NOW Backwards and forwards half her length END
BEGIN NOW With a short uneasy motion. END
BEGIN NOW Then like a pawing horse let go, END
BEGIN NOW She made a sudden bound: END
BEGIN NOW It flung the blood into my head, END
BEGIN NOW And I fell down in a swound. END
BEGIN NOW How long in that same fit I lay, END
BEGIN NOW I have not to declare; END
BEGIN NOW But ere my living life returned, END
BEGIN NOW I heard and in my soul discerned END
BEGIN NOW Two VOICES in the air. END
BEGIN NOW Is it he?" quoth one, "Is this the man? END
BEGIN NOW By him who died on cross, END
BEGIN NOW With his cruel bow he laid full low, END
BEGIN NOW The harmless Albatross. END
BEGIN NOW The spirit who bideth by himself END
BEGIN NOW In the land of mist and snow, END
BEGIN NOW He loved the bird that loved the man END
BEGIN NOW Who shot him with his bow. END
BEGIN NOW The other was a softer voice, END
BEGIN NOW As soft as honey-dew: END
BEGIN NOW Quoth he, "The man hath penance done, END
BEGIN NOW And penance more will do. END
BEGIN NOW But tell me, tell me! speak again, END
BEGIN NOW Thy soft response renewing-- END
BEGIN NOW What makes that ship drive on so fast? END
BEGIN NOW What is the OCEAN doing? END
BEGIN NOW Still as a slave before his lord, END
BEGIN NOW The OCEAN hath no blast; END
BEGIN NOW His great bright eye most silently END
BEGIN NOW Up to the Moon is cast-- END
BEGIN NOW If he may know which way to go; END
BEGIN NOW For she guides him smooth or grim END
BEGIN NOW See, brother, see! how graciously END
BEGIN NOW She looketh down on him. END
BEGIN NOW But why drives on that ship so fast, END
BEGIN NOW Without or wave or wind? END
BEGIN NOW The air is cut away before, END
BEGIN NOW And closes from behind. END
BEGIN NOW Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high END
BEGIN NOW Or we shall be belated: END
BEGIN NOW For slow and slow that ship will go, END
BEGIN NOW When the Mariner's trance is abated. END
BEGIN NOW I woke, and we were sailing on END
BEGIN NOW As in a gentle weather: END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas night, calm night, the Moon was high; END
BEGIN NOW The dead men stood together. END
BEGIN NOW All stood together on the deck, END
BEGIN NOW For a charnel-dungeon fitter: END
BEGIN NOW All fixed on me their stony eyes, END
BEGIN NOW That in the Moon did glitter. END
BEGIN NOW The pang, the curse, with which they died, END
BEGIN NOW Had never passed away: END
BEGIN NOW I could not draw my eyes from theirs, END
BEGIN NOW Nor turn them up to pray. END
BEGIN NOW And now this spell was snapt: once more END
BEGIN NOW I viewed the ocean green. END
BEGIN NOW And looked far forth, yet little saw END
BEGIN NOW Of what had else been seen-- END
BEGIN NOW Like one that on a lonesome road END
BEGIN NOW Doth walk in fear and dread, END
BEGIN NOW And having once turned round walks on, END
BEGIN NOW And turns no more his head; END
BEGIN NOW Because he knows, a frightful fiend END
BEGIN NOW Doth close behind him tread. END
BEGIN NOW But soon there breathed a wind on me, END
BEGIN NOW Nor sound nor motion made: END
BEGIN NOW Its path was not upon the sea, END
BEGIN NOW In ripple or in shade. END
BEGIN NOW It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek END
BEGIN NOW Like a meadow-gale of spring-- END
BEGIN NOW It mingled strangely with my fears, END
BEGIN NOW Yet it felt like a welcoming. END
BEGIN NOW Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship, END
BEGIN NOW Yet she sailed softly too: END
BEGIN NOW Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze-- END
BEGIN NOW On me alone it blew. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed END
BEGIN NOW The light-house top I see? END
BEGIN NOW Is this the hill? is this the kirk? END
BEGIN NOW Is this mine own countree! END
BEGIN NOW We drifted o'er the harbour-bar, END
BEGIN NOW And I with sobs did pray-- END
BEGIN NOW O let me be awake, my God! END
BEGIN NOW Or let me sleep alway. END
BEGIN NOW The harbour-bay was clear as glass, END
BEGIN NOW So smoothly it was strewn! END
BEGIN NOW And on the bay the moonlight lay, END
BEGIN NOW And the shadow of the moon. END
BEGIN NOW The rock shone bright, the kirk no less, END
BEGIN NOW That stands above the rock: END
BEGIN NOW The moonlight steeped in silentness END
BEGIN NOW The steady weathercock. END
BEGIN NOW And the bay was white with silent light, END
BEGIN NOW Till rising from the same, END
BEGIN NOW Full many shapes, that shadows were, END
BEGIN NOW In crimson colours came. END
BEGIN NOW A little distance from the prow END
BEGIN NOW Those crimson shadows were: END
BEGIN NOW I turned my eyes upon the deck-- END
BEGIN NOW Oh, Christ! what saw I there! END
BEGIN NOW Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat, END
BEGIN NOW And, by the holy rood! END
BEGIN NOW A man all light, a seraph-man, END
BEGIN NOW On every corse there stood. END
BEGIN NOW This seraph band, each waved his hand: END
BEGIN NOW It was a heavenly sight! END
BEGIN NOW They stood as signals to the land, END
BEGIN NOW Each one a lovely light: END
BEGIN NOW This seraph-band, each waved his hand, END
BEGIN NOW No voice did they impart-- END
BEGIN NOW No voice; but oh! the silence sank END
BEGIN NOW Like music on my heart. END
BEGIN NOW But soon I heard the dash of oars; END
BEGIN NOW I heard the Pilot's cheer; END
BEGIN NOW My head was turned perforce away, END
BEGIN NOW And I saw a boat appear. END
BEGIN NOW The Pilot, and the Pilot's boy, END
BEGIN NOW I heard them coming fast: END
BEGIN NOW The dead men could not blast. END
BEGIN NOW I saw a third--I heard his voice: END
BEGIN NOW It is the Hermit good! END
BEGIN NOW He singeth loud his godly hymns END
BEGIN NOW That he makes in the wood. END
BEGIN NOW He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away END
BEGIN NOW The Albatross's blood. END
BEGIN NOW This Hermit good lives in that wood END
BEGIN NOW Which slopes down to the sea. END
BEGIN NOW How loudly his sweet voice he rears! END
BEGIN NOW He loves to talk with marineres END
BEGIN NOW That come from a far countree. END
BEGIN NOW He kneels at morn and noon and eve-- END
BEGIN NOW He hath a cushion plump: END
BEGIN NOW It is the moss that wholly hides END
BEGIN NOW The rotted old oak-stump. END
BEGIN NOW The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk, END
BEGIN NOW Why this is strange, I trow! END
BEGIN NOW Where are those lights so many and fair, END
BEGIN NOW That signal made but now? END
BEGIN NOW Strange, by my faith!" the Hermit said-- END
BEGIN NOW And they answered not our cheer! END
BEGIN NOW The planks looked warped! and see those sails, END
BEGIN NOW How thin they are and sere! END
BEGIN NOW I never saw aught like to them, END
BEGIN NOW Unless perchance it were END
BEGIN NOW Brown skeletons of leaves that lag END
BEGIN NOW My forest-brook along; END
BEGIN NOW When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow, END
BEGIN NOW And the owlet whoops to the wolf below, END
BEGIN NOW That eats the she-wolf's young. END
BEGIN NOW Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look-- END
BEGIN NOW (The Pilot made reply) END
BEGIN NOW I am a-feared"--"Push on, push on! END
BEGIN NOW Said the Hermit cheerily. END
BEGIN NOW The boat came closer to the ship, END
BEGIN NOW But I nor spake nor stirred; END
BEGIN NOW The boat came close beneath the ship, END
BEGIN NOW And straight a sound was heard. END
BEGIN NOW Under the water it rumbled on, END
BEGIN NOW Still louder and more dread: END
BEGIN NOW It reached the ship, it split the bay; END
BEGIN NOW The ship went down like lead. END
BEGIN NOW Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound, END
BEGIN NOW Which sky and ocean smote, END
BEGIN NOW Like one that hath been seven days drowned END
BEGIN NOW My body lay afloat; END
BEGIN NOW But swift as dreams, myself I found END
BEGIN NOW Within the Pilot's boat. END
BEGIN NOW Upon the whirl, where sank the ship, END
BEGIN NOW The boat spun round and round; END
BEGIN NOW And all was still, save that the hill END
BEGIN NOW Was telling of the sound. END
BEGIN NOW I moved my lips--the Pilot shrieked END
BEGIN NOW And fell down in a fit; END
BEGIN NOW The holy Hermit raised his eyes, END
BEGIN NOW And prayed where he did sit. END
BEGIN NOW I took the oars: the Pilot's boy, END
BEGIN NOW Laughed loud and long, and all the while END
BEGIN NOW His eyes went to and fro. END
BEGIN NOW Ha! ha!" quoth he, "full plain I see, END
BEGIN NOW The Devil knows how to row. END
BEGIN NOW And now, all in my own countree, END
BEGIN NOW I stood on the firm land! END
BEGIN NOW The Hermit stepped forth from the boat, END
BEGIN NOW And scarcely he could stand. END
BEGIN NOW O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man! END
BEGIN NOW The Hermit crossed his brow. END
BEGIN NOW Say quick," quoth he, "I bid thee say-- END
BEGIN NOW What manner of man art thou? END
BEGIN NOW Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched END
BEGIN NOW With a woeful agony, END
BEGIN NOW Which forced me to begin my tale; END
BEGIN NOW And then it left me free. END
BEGIN NOW Since then, at an uncertain hour, END
BEGIN NOW That agony returns; END
BEGIN NOW And till my ghastly tale is told, END
BEGIN NOW This heart within me burns. END
BEGIN NOW I pass, like night, from land to land; END
BEGIN NOW I have strange power of speech; END
BEGIN NOW That moment that his face I see, END
BEGIN NOW I know the man that must hear me: END
BEGIN NOW To him my tale I teach. END
BEGIN NOW What loud uproar bursts from that door! END
BEGIN NOW The wedding-guests are there: END
BEGIN NOW But in the garden-bower the bride END
BEGIN NOW And bride-maids singing are: END
BEGIN NOW And hark the little vesper bell, END
BEGIN NOW Which biddeth me to prayer! END
BEGIN NOW O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been END
BEGIN NOW Alone on a wide wide sea: END
BEGIN NOW So lonely 'twas, that God himself END
BEGIN NOW Scarce seemed there to be. END
BEGIN NOW O sweeter than the marriage-feast, END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis sweeter far to me, END
BEGIN NOW To walk together to the kirk END
BEGIN NOW With a goodly company!-- END
BEGIN NOW To walk together to the kirk, END
BEGIN NOW And all together pray, END
BEGIN NOW While each to his great Father bends, END
BEGIN NOW Old men, and babes, and loving friends, END
BEGIN NOW And youths and maidens gay! END
BEGIN NOW Farewell, farewell! but this I tell END
BEGIN NOW To thee, thou Wedding-Guest! END
BEGIN NOW He prayeth well, who loveth well END
BEGIN NOW Both man and bird and beast. END
BEGIN NOW He prayeth best, who loveth best END
BEGIN NOW All things both great and small; END
BEGIN NOW For the dear God who loveth us END
BEGIN NOW He made and loveth all. END
BEGIN NOW The Mariner, whose eye is bright, END
BEGIN NOW Whose beard with age is hoar, END
BEGIN NOW Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest END
BEGIN NOW Turned from the bridegroom's door. END
BEGIN NOW He went like one that hath been stunned, END
BEGIN NOW And is of sense forlorn: END
BEGIN NOW A sadder and a wiser man, END
BEGIN NOW He rose the morrow morn. END
BEGIN NOW Pondering shadows, colors, clouds END

BEGIN NOW in honor of the night. END
BEGIN NOW Under the shade of a wild rose sat the Queen and her little END
BEGIN NOW Maids of Honor, beside the silvery mushroom where the feast END
BEGIN NOW was spread. END
BEGIN NOW With a gay smile, "Sunny Lock" began her story. END
BEGIN NOW As I was painting the bright petals of a blue bell, it told me END
BEGIN NOW this tale. END
BEGIN NOW THREE little Fairies sat in the fields eating their breakfast; END
BEGIN NOW each among the leaves of her favorite flower, Daisy, Primrose, END
BEGIN NOW and Violet, were happy as Elves need be. END
BEGIN NOW The morning wind gently rocked them to and fro, and the sun END
BEGIN NOW shone warmly down upon the dewy grass, where butterflies spread END
BEGIN NOW their gay wings, and bees with their deep voices sung END
BEGIN NOW among the flowers; while the little birds hopped merrily about END
BEGIN NOW to peep at them. END
BEGIN NOW On a silvery mushroom was spread the breakfast; little cakes END
BEGIN NOW of flower-dust lay on a broad green leaf, beside a crimson END
BEGIN NOW strawberry, which, with sugar from the violet, and cream END
BEGIN NOW from the yellow milkweed, made a fairy meal, and their drink was END
BEGIN NOW the dew from the flowers' bright leaves. END
BEGIN NOW Ah me," sighed Primrose, throwing herself languidly back, END
BEGIN NOW how warm the sun grows! give me another piece of strawberry, END
BEGIN NOW and then I must hasten away to the shadow of the ferns. But END
BEGIN NOW while I eat, tell me, dear Violet, why are you all so sad? END
BEGIN NOW I have scarce seen a happy face since my return from Rose Land; END
BEGIN NOW dear friend, what means it? END
BEGIN NOW I will tell you," replied little Violet, the tears gathering END
BEGIN NOW in her soft eyes. "Our good Queen is ever striving to keep END
BEGIN NOW and we can do nothing to help or advise her now. END
BEGIN NOW The ant and bee learned generosity, the butterfly and bird END
BEGIN NOW contentment, the mole and worm confidence in the love of others; END
BEGIN NOW many-colored flowers. END
BEGIN NOW At length she rose, and amid the deep silence spoke thus:-- END
BEGIN NOW Dear children, let us not tire of a good work, hard though it be END
BEGIN NOW bloom in peace within their quiet homes? We have tried to gain END
BEGIN NOW sunlight and to joy. How then may we keep our frail blossoms END
BEGIN NOW from his cruel spirits? Who will give us counsel? Who will be END
BEGIN NOW our messenger for the last time? Speak, my subjects. END
BEGIN NOW Long and eagerly they spoke, and their soft voices rose high. END
BEGIN NOW Through the crowd there came a little form, a wreath of pure END
BEGIN NOW white violets lay among the bright locks that fell so softly END
BEGIN NOW round the gentle face, where a deep blush glowed, as, kneeling at END
BEGIN NOW spoken fearlessly of his evil deeds? Have we shed the soft light END
BEGIN NOW Our messengers have gone fearfully, and with cold looks and END
BEGIN NOW courtly words offered him rich gifts, things he cared not for, END
BEGIN NOW and with equal pride has he sent them back. END
BEGIN NOW Then let me, the weakest of your band, go to him, trusting END
BEGIN NOW in the love I know lies hidden in the coldest heart. END
BEGIN NOW I will bear only a garland of our fairest flowers; these END
BEGIN NOW will I wind about him, and their bright faces, looking lovingly END
BEGIN NOW in his, will bring sweet thoughts to his dark mind, and their END
BEGIN NOW soft breath steal in like gentle words. Then, when he sees them END
BEGIN NOW never leave his dreary home, till the sunlight falls on flowers END
BEGIN NOW fair as those that bloom in our own dear land. END
BEGIN NOW All who will aid our brave little messenger, lift your wands, END
BEGIN NOW Every fairy wand glistened in the air, as with silvery voices END
BEGIN NOW they cried, "Love and little Violet. END
BEGIN NOW of the fairest flowers. Tenderly they gathered them, with the END
BEGIN NOW night-dew fresh upon their leaves, and as they wove chanted sweet END
BEGIN NOW whom they sent forth to die in a dreary land, that their gentle END
BEGIN NOW kindred might bloom unharmed. END
BEGIN NOW At length it was done; and the fair flowers lay glowing END
BEGIN NOW We are sending you, dear flowers, END
BEGIN NOW Forth alone to die, END
BEGIN NOW Where your gentle sisters may not weep END
BEGIN NOW O'er the cold graves where you lie; END
BEGIN NOW But you go to bring them fadeless life END
BEGIN NOW In the bright homes where they dwell, END
BEGIN NOW And you softly smile that 't is so, END
BEGIN NOW As we sadly sing farewell. END
BEGIN NOW O plead with gentle words for us, END
BEGIN NOW And whisper tenderly END
BEGIN NOW Of generous love to that cold heart, END
BEGIN NOW And it will answer ye; END
BEGIN NOW And though you fade in a dreary home, END
BEGIN NOW Yet loving hearts will tell END
BEGIN NOW Of the joy and peace that you have given: END
BEGIN NOW Flowers, dear flowers, farewell! END
BEGIN NOW The morning sun looked softly down upon the broad green earth, END
BEGIN NOW Thus went Violet through the clear air, and the earth looked END
BEGIN NOW smiling up to her, as, with the bright wreath folded in her END
BEGIN NOW arms, she flew among the soft, white clouds. END
BEGIN NOW On and on she went, over hill and valley, broad rivers and END
BEGIN NOW rustling woods, till the warm sunlight passed away, the winds END
BEGIN NOW grew cold, and the air thick with falling snow. Then far below END
BEGIN NOW murmured sadly through the wintry air. END
BEGIN NOW With a beating heart Violet folded her fading wreath more closely END
BEGIN NOW Gently she answered, telling them her errand, beseeching them END
BEGIN NOW to let her pass ere the cold wind blighted her frail blossoms. END
BEGIN NOW Then they flung wide the doors, and she passed in. END
BEGIN NOW Walls of ice, carved with strange figures, were around her; END
BEGIN NOW glittering icicles hung from the high roof, and soft, white snow END
BEGIN NOW covered the hard floors. On a throne hung with clouds sat END
BEGIN NOW the Frost-King; a crown of crystals bound his white locks, and END
BEGIN NOW a dark mantle wrought with delicate frost-work was folded over END
BEGIN NOW his cold breast. END
BEGIN NOW His stern face could not stay little Violet, and on through END
BEGIN NOW the long hall she went, heedless of the snow that gathered on END
BEGIN NOW her feet, and the bleak wind that blew around her; while the King END
BEGIN NOW O King of blight and sorrow, send me not away till I have END
BEGIN NOW These fair flowers, with the prayers of all Fairy Land, I lay END
BEGIN NOW before you; O send me not away till they are answered. END
BEGIN NOW And with tears falling thick and fast upon their tender leaves, END
BEGIN NOW I cannot grant your prayer, little Fairy; it is my will END
BEGIN NOW the flowers should die. Go back to your Queen, and tell her END
BEGIN NOW that I cannot yield my power to please these foolish flowers. END
BEGIN NOW Then Violet hung the wreath above the throne, and with weary foot END
BEGIN NOW Then came the Frost-Spirits, and beneath their cold wings the END
BEGIN NOW flowers died, while the Spirits bore Violet to a low, dark cell, END
BEGIN NOW in her ear, imploring her to save them. Then she wept no longer, END
BEGIN NOW Then she went to the ugly brown spiders, and in gentle words END
BEGIN NOW better food than helpless insects. You shall live in peace, END
BEGIN NOW and spin your delicate threads into a mantle for the stern King; END
BEGIN NOW And while she gayly sung, the little weavers spun their silken END
BEGIN NOW When the Frost-Spirits told their King, he greatly wondered and END
BEGIN NOW floated out into the cold air, where it hung like bright clouds END
BEGIN NOW above the dreary gardens, whence all the Spirits' power could not END
BEGIN NOW flowers bloomed; but the Spirits heaped snow upon them, and END
BEGIN NOW they bowed their heads and died. END
BEGIN NOW At length the mantle was finished, and amid the gray threads END
BEGIN NOW shone golden ones, making it bright; and she sent it to the King, END
BEGIN NOW to dwell within his breast. END
BEGIN NOW But he scornfully threw it aside, and bade his Spirits take her END
BEGIN NOW to a colder cell, deep in the earth; and there with harsh words END
BEGIN NOW they left her. END
BEGIN NOW velvet-coated moles, praying that they might listen to the sweet END
BEGIN NOW music, and lie in the warm light. END
BEGIN NOW We lead," said they, "a dreary life in the cold earth; the END
BEGIN NOW flower-roots are dead, and no soft dews descend for us to drink, END
BEGIN NOW no little seed or leaf can we find. Ah, good Fairy, let us be END
BEGIN NOW And Violet said, Yes; so day after day they labored to make END
BEGIN NOW From his dark castle the King looked out on the happy flowers, END
BEGIN NOW who nodded gayly to him, and in sweet colors strove to tell him END
BEGIN NOW of the good little Spirit, who toiled so faithfully below, END
BEGIN NOW her dismal prison. END
BEGIN NOW Soon they came hastening back, and prayed him to come and see END
BEGIN NOW how lovely the dark cell had grown. The rough floor was spread END
BEGIN NOW with deep green moss, and over wall and roof grew flowery vines, END
BEGIN NOW casting crumbs to the downy little moles who ran fearlessly about END
BEGIN NOW With a sad farewell to her little friends she followed him, and END
BEGIN NOW Little Fairy, I offer you two things, and you may choose END
BEGIN NOW Ah! answered Violet sadly, "do you not know that beneath END
BEGIN NOW the flowers' bright leaves there beats a little heart that loves END
BEGIN NOW and sorrows like our own? And can I, heedless of their beauty, END
BEGIN NOW warm, trusting hearts. END
BEGIN NOW Then listen," said the King, "to the task I give you. You shall END
BEGIN NOW that miracle I will grant your prayer or lose my kingly crown. END
BEGIN NOW Then out into the gardens went Violet with a heavy heart; for END
BEGIN NOW she had toiled so long, her strength was nearly gone. But the END
BEGIN NOW As time went by, the Frost-King feared the task had been END
BEGIN NOW the flowers bowed their heads, and all was dark and cold as when END
BEGIN NOW the gentle Fairy came. END
BEGIN NOW And to the stern King his home seemed more desolate and sad; for END
BEGIN NOW he missed the warm light, the happy flowers, and, more than all, END
BEGIN NOW the gay voice and bright face of little Violet. So he wandered END
BEGIN NOW through his dreary palace, wondering how he had been content END
BEGIN NOW to live before without sunlight and love. END
BEGIN NOW and blossom which she had loved, and strove to be like her in END
BEGIN NOW welcomed him, and brought fresh dew and rosy fruit to refresh the END
BEGIN NOW her fadeless love had made the dark cell bright and beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW the Elves upon the scene before them. END
BEGIN NOW Flowering vines folded their soft leaves around the trees, END
BEGIN NOW bearing two crowns, one of sparkling icicles, the other of pure END
BEGIN NOW white lilies, and kneeling before him, said,-- END
BEGIN NOW Send forth your Spirits to carry sorrow and desolation over END
BEGIN NOW The old King looked at the little Fairy, and saw how lovingly END
BEGIN NOW the bright shadows gathered round her, as if to shield her END
BEGIN NOW from every harm; the timid birds nestled in her bosom, and the END
BEGIN NOW Kind thought came thronging to his mind, and he turned to look at END
BEGIN NOW Then, amid a burst of wild, sweet music, the Frost-King placed END
BEGIN NOW The old King, surrounded by the happy Fairies, sat in Violet's END
BEGIN NOW with the Elves, and waited on their King with loving eagerness. END
BEGIN NOW Brighter grew the golden light, gayer sang the birds, and the END
BEGIN NOW harmonious voices of grateful flowers, sounding over the earth, END
BEGIN NOW carried new joy to all their gentle kindred. END
BEGIN NOW Brighter shone the golden shadows; END
BEGIN NOW On the cool wind softly came END
BEGIN NOW The low, sweet tones of happy flowers, END
BEGIN NOW Singing little Violet's name. END
BEGIN NOW 'Mong the green trees was it whispered, END
BEGIN NOW And the bright waves bore it on END
BEGIN NOW To the lonely forest flowers, END
BEGIN NOW Where the glad news had not gone. END
BEGIN NOW Thus the Frost-King lost his kingdom, END
BEGIN NOW And his power to harm and blight. END
BEGIN NOW Violet conquered, and his cold heart END
BEGIN NOW Warmed with music, love, and light; END
BEGIN NOW And his fair home, once so dreary, END
BEGIN NOW Gay with lovely Elves and flowers, END
BEGIN NOW Brought a joy that never faded END
BEGIN NOW Through the long bright summer hours. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, by Violet's magic power, END
BEGIN NOW All dark shadows passed away, END
BEGIN NOW And o'er the home of happy flowers END
BEGIN NOW The golden light for ever lay. END
BEGIN NOW Thus the Fairy mission ended, END
BEGIN NOW And all Flower-Land was taught END
BEGIN NOW The "Power of Love," by gentle deeds END
BEGIN NOW That little Violet wrought. END
BEGIN NOW DOWN among the grass and fragrant clover lay little Eva by the END
BEGIN NOW It was a lily of the valley, whose tall stem formed the mast, END
BEGIN NOW who danced to the music of the silver lily-bells above, that rang END
BEGIN NOW and sang with the dancing waves. END
BEGIN NOW They looked kindly on the child, and, after whispering long among END
BEGIN NOW Eva looked into the brook, and saw a tiny child standing between END
BEGIN NOW the Elves. "Now I can go with you," said she, "but see, I can END
BEGIN NOW Now must we go home," said the Queen, "and you shall go with us, END
BEGIN NOW the fragrant petals of a crimson rose. END
BEGIN NOW You can look at the bright colors till the light fades, and then END
BEGIN NOW lovingly above her, and sang in the clear moonlight. END
BEGIN NOW With the sun rose the Fairies, and, with Eva, hastened away to END
BEGIN NOW Then they flew away to the gardens, and soon, high up among the END
BEGIN NOW bright-winged birds came fearlessly among them, pecking the same END
BEGIN NOW Now, little Eva," said they, "you will see that Fairies are not END
BEGIN NOW idle, wilful Spirits, as mortals believe. Come, we will show you END
BEGIN NOW They led her to a lovely room, through whose walls of deep green END
BEGIN NOW leaves the light stole softly in. Here lay many wounded insects, END
BEGIN NOW Eva wondered, but silently followed her guide, little Rose-Leaf, END
BEGIN NOW who with tender words passed among the delicate blossoms, END
BEGIN NOW Then she went to the insects; first to a little fly who lay in a END
BEGIN NOW flower-leaf cradle. END
BEGIN NOW Do you suffer much, dear Gauzy-Wing?" asked the Fairy. "I will END
BEGIN NOW Then said the Fairy, while she bathed the broken wing,-- END
BEGIN NOW Love-Blossom, you should not murmur. We may find happiness in END
BEGIN NOW Then a faint voice whispered, "Little Rose-Leaf, come quickly, or END
BEGIN NOW Dear Fairy, the fairest flowers have cheered me with their sweet END
BEGIN NOW Then the quivering wings were still, and the patient little dove END
BEGIN NOW gentleness and love are prized far above gold or beauty, here in END
BEGIN NOW to welcome her. END
BEGIN NOW Dear Queen," she sadly said, "I would gladly bring as pleasant END
BEGIN NOW tidings as my sister, but, alas! my flowers are proud and wilful, END
BEGIN NOW proudly closed their leaves and bid me go. END
BEGIN NOW and when next you come, you will be laden with gifts from humble, END
BEGIN NOW Then into a cheerful place they went, where were many groups of END
BEGIN NOW flowers, among whose leaves sat the child Elves, and learned from END
BEGIN NOW studied how to watch the tender buds, when to spread them to the END
BEGIN NOW sunlight, and when to shelter them from rain; how to guard the END
BEGIN NOW Eva nodded to the gay little ones, as they peeped from among the END
BEGIN NOW among the petals of a flower that bent beside them, and asked END
BEGIN NOW questions that none but Fairies would care to know. END
BEGIN NOW Rosebud, if a Cowslip opens three leaves in one day and four the END
BEGIN NOW has bloomed? END
BEGIN NOW Seven, sang the gay little Elf. END
BEGIN NOW Harebell, if a silkworm spin one yard of Fairy cloth in an hour, END
BEGIN NOW Twelve, said the Fairy child. END
BEGIN NOW Primrose, where lies Violet Island? END
BEGIN NOW Lilla, you may bound Rose Land. END
BEGIN NOW Then Eva saw how, on large, white leaves, the Fairies learned to END
BEGIN NOW You have stayed long enough," said the Elves at length, "we have END
BEGIN NOW So Eva said farewell to the child Elves, and hastened with little END
BEGIN NOW Then the child wondered no longer, but deeper grew her love END
BEGIN NOW Long they stayed, and many a lesson little Eva learned: but when END
BEGIN NOW Then they went into a dark and lonely room, and here they found END
BEGIN NOW Ah, sighed the little one, "it was my only friend, and I END
BEGIN NOW cherished it with all my lone heart's love; 't was all that made END
BEGIN NOW my sad life happy; and it is gone. END
BEGIN NOW Tenderly the child fastened the drooping stem, and placed it END
BEGIN NOW where the one faint ray of sunlight stole into the dreary room. END
BEGIN NOW Do you see," said the Elves, "through this simple flower will we END
BEGIN NOW And with busy love toiled the Elves amid the withered leaves, END
BEGIN NOW lonely home; sweet, gentle thoughts filled her heart as she bent END
BEGIN NOW to whisper gentle words, to cheer and comfort. END
BEGIN NOW Thus their little hands led him back to peace and happiness, END
BEGIN NOW waking in their bosoms all the holy feelings and sweet affections END
BEGIN NOW Then through the summer sky, above the blossoming earth, they END
BEGIN NOW Long they feasted, gayly they sang, and Eva, dancing merrily END
BEGIN NOW among them, longed to be an Elf that she might dwell forever END
BEGIN NOW in so fair a home. END
BEGIN NOW Dear child, tomorrow we must bear you home, for, much as we long END
BEGIN NOW Where have you brought me, and what mean these lovely sounds? END
BEGIN NOW asked Eva. END
BEGIN NOW Look here, and you shall see," said Rose-Leaf, as she bent aside END
BEGIN NOW Look again, and I will tell you," answered the Fairy. END
BEGIN NOW Eva looked, and saw from every flower a tiny form come forth to END
BEGIN NOW worthless thing if all be not fair and sweet within. Do you see END
BEGIN NOW yonder lovely spirit singing with my sister Moonlight? a clover END
BEGIN NOW I will never break another flower," cried Eva; "but let me go END
BEGIN NOW On a rosy morning cloud, surrounded by the loving Elves, went Eva END
BEGIN NOW will make you happiest, and it shall be yours. END
BEGIN NOW to make me happy, and taught me so many good and gentle lessons, END
BEGIN NOW loving friends. END
BEGIN NOW Now, Star-Twinkle, what have you to teach?" asked the Queen. END
BEGIN NOW THERE grew a fragrant rose-tree where the brook flows, END
BEGIN NOW With two little tender buds, and one full rose; END
BEGIN NOW When the sun went down to his bed in the west, END
BEGIN NOW The little buds leaned on the rose-mother's breast, END
BEGIN NOW While the bright eyed stars their long watch kept, END
BEGIN NOW And the flowers of the valley in their green cradles slept; END
BEGIN NOW Then silently in odors they communed with each other, END
BEGIN NOW The two little buds on the bosom of their mother. END
BEGIN NOW O sister," said the little one, as she gazed at the sky, END
BEGIN NOW I wish that the Dew Elves, as they wander lightly by, END
BEGIN NOW Would bring me a star; for they never grow dim, END
BEGIN NOW And the Father does not need them to burn round him. END
BEGIN NOW The shining drops of dew the Elves bring each day END
BEGIN NOW And place in my bosom, so soon pass away; END
BEGIN NOW But a star would glitter brightly through the long summer hours, END
BEGIN NOW And I should be fairer than all my sister flowers. END
BEGIN NOW That were better far than the dew-drops that fall END
BEGIN NOW On the high and the low, and come alike to all. END
BEGIN NOW I would be fair and stately, with a bright star to shine END
BEGIN NOW And give a queenly air to this crimson robe of mine. END
BEGIN NOW And proudly she cried, "These fire-flies shall be END
BEGIN NOW Just then a tiny dew-drop that hung o'er the dell END
BEGIN NOW On the breast of the bud like a soft star fell; END
BEGIN NOW But impatiently she flung it away from her leaf, END
BEGIN NOW And it fell on her mother like a tear of grief, END
BEGIN NOW While she folded to her breast, with wilful pride, END
BEGIN NOW A glittering fire-fly that hung by her side. END
BEGIN NOW Heed, said the mother rose, "daughter mine, END
BEGIN NOW Why shouldst thou seek for beauty not thine? END
BEGIN NOW The Father hath made thee what thou now art; END
BEGIN NOW And what he most loveth is a sweet, pure heart. END
BEGIN NOW Then why dost thou take with such discontent END
BEGIN NOW The loving gift which he to thee hath sent? END
BEGIN NOW For the cool fresh dew will render thee far END
BEGIN NOW More lovely and sweet than the brightest star; END
BEGIN NOW They were made for Heaven, and can never come to shine END
BEGIN NOW Like the fire-fly thou hast in that foolish breast of thine. END
BEGIN NOW O my foolish little bud, do listen to thy mother; END
BEGIN NOW Care only for true beauty, and seek for no other. END
BEGIN NOW There will be grief and trouble in that wilful little heart; END
BEGIN NOW Unfold thy leaves, my daughter, and let the fly depart. END
BEGIN NOW But the proud little bud would have her own will, END
BEGIN NOW And folded the fire-fly more closely still; END
BEGIN NOW Till the struggling insect tore open the vest END
BEGIN NOW Of purple and green, that covered her breast. END
BEGIN NOW When the sun came up, she saw with grief END
BEGIN NOW The blooming of her sister bud leaf by leaf. END
BEGIN NOW While she, once as fair and bright as the rest, END
BEGIN NOW Hung her weary head down on her wounded breast. END
BEGIN NOW Bright grew the sunshine, and the soft summer air END
BEGIN NOW Was filled with the music of flowers singing there; END
BEGIN NOW But faint grew the little bud with thirst and pain, END
BEGIN NOW And longed for the cool dew; but now 't was in vain. END
BEGIN NOW Then bitterly she wept for her folly and pride, END
BEGIN NOW As drooping she stood by her fair sister's side. END
BEGIN NOW Then the rose mother leaned the weary little head END
BEGIN NOW On her bosom to rest, and tenderly she said: END
BEGIN NOW Thou hast learned, my little bud, that, whatever may betide, END
BEGIN NOW Thou canst win thyself no joy by passion or by pride. END
BEGIN NOW The loving Father sends the sunshine and the shower, END
BEGIN NOW That thou mayst become a perfect little flower;-- END
BEGIN NOW The sweet dews to feed thee, the soft wind to cheer, END
BEGIN NOW And the earth as a pleasant home, while thou art dwelling here. END
BEGIN NOW Then shouldst thou not be grateful for all this kindly care, END
BEGIN NOW And strive to keep thyself most innocent and fair? END
BEGIN NOW Then seek, my little blossom, to win humility; END
BEGIN NOW Be fair without, be pure within, and thou wilt happy be. END
BEGIN NOW So when the quiet Autumn of thy fragrant life shall come, END
BEGIN NOW Thou mayst pass away, to bloom in the Flower Spirits' home. END
BEGIN NOW Then from the mother's breast, where it still lay hid, END
BEGIN NOW Into the fading bud the dew-drop gently slid; END
BEGIN NOW Stronger grew the little form, and happy tears fell, END
BEGIN NOW As the dew did its silent work, and the bud grew well, END
BEGIN NOW While the gentle rose leaned, with motherly pride, END
BEGIN NOW O'er the fair little ones that bloomed at her side. END
BEGIN NOW Night came again, and the fire-flies flew; END
BEGIN NOW But the bud let them pass, and drank of the dew; END
BEGIN NOW While the soft stars shone, from the still summer heaven, END
BEGIN NOW On the happy little flower that had learned the lesson given. END
BEGIN NOW The little bud's lesson shall teach us how sad a thing is pride, END
BEGIN NOW ONCE upon a time, two little Fairies went out into the world, to END
BEGIN NOW came always from the wing of the gayest butterfly. END
BEGIN NOW But he was not loved in Fairy-Land, for, like the flower whose END
BEGIN NOW name and colors he wore, though fair to look upon, many were the END
BEGIN NOW Such was Thistledown; but far different was his little friend, END
BEGIN NOW On and on, over hill and valley, they went, chasing the gay END
BEGIN NOW Now, dear Thistle, do not harm these friendly blossoms," said END
BEGIN NOW Lily-Bell; "see how kindly they spread their leaves, and offer us END
BEGIN NOW leaves, lest he should harm them. END
BEGIN NOW blooming flower and a tiny bud. END
BEGIN NOW He would have stayed to harm them, but the rain fell fast, and he END
BEGIN NOW we will do you harm. END
BEGIN NOW this cold wind and rain. END
BEGIN NOW Others can forgive and love, beside Lily-Bell and Violet," said END
BEGIN NOW Soon the sunlight came again, and with it Lily-Bell seeking for END
BEGIN NOW Thistledown; but he was ashamed, and stole away. END
BEGIN NOW strove to comfort those whom he had grieved; with gentle care she END
BEGIN NOW So Thistle gladly went with him, and soon they came to a pleasant END
BEGIN NOW You cannot see our Queen to-night," said the little bee, but END
BEGIN NOW I will show you to a bed where you can rest. END
BEGIN NOW And he led the tired Fairy to a little cell, where on a bed of END
BEGIN NOW flower-leaves he folded his wings and fell asleep. END
BEGIN NOW Awake! awake! for the earliest gleam END
BEGIN NOW Of golden sunlight shines END
BEGIN NOW On the rippling waves, that brightly flow END
BEGIN NOW Beneath the flowering vines. END
BEGIN NOW Awake! awake! for the low, sweet chant END
BEGIN NOW Of the wild-birds' morning hymn END
BEGIN NOW Comes floating by on the fragrant air, END
BEGIN NOW Through the forest cool and dim; END
BEGIN NOW Then spread each wing, END
BEGIN NOW And work, and sing, END
BEGIN NOW Through the long, bright sunny hours; END
BEGIN NOW O'er the pleasant earth END
BEGIN NOW We journey forth, END
BEGIN NOW For a day among the flowers. END
BEGIN NOW Awake! awake! for the summer wind END
BEGIN NOW Hath bidden the blossoms unclose, END
BEGIN NOW Hath opened the violet's soft blue eye, END
BEGIN NOW And wakened the sleeping rose. END
BEGIN NOW And lightly they wave on their slender stems END
BEGIN NOW Fragrant, and fresh, and fair, END
BEGIN NOW Waiting for us, as we singing come END
BEGIN NOW To gather our honey-dew there. END
BEGIN NOW Then spread each wing, END
BEGIN NOW And work, and sing, END
BEGIN NOW Through the long, bright sunny hours; END
BEGIN NOW O'er the pleasant earth END
BEGIN NOW We journey forth, END
BEGIN NOW For a day among the flowers! END
BEGIN NOW shoulder, and his little cap held respectfully in his hand, he END
BEGIN NOW followed Nimble-Wing to the great hall, where the Queen was being END
BEGIN NOW things. Order, patience, industry, who can teach so well as they END
BEGIN NOW Now come with us," they said. So forth into the green fields END
BEGIN NOW before he came to live with them, that many grew unhappy and END
BEGIN NOW discontented, and they who had before wished no greater joy than END
BEGIN NOW subjects, grief and care to me. I cannot let my peaceful kingdom END
BEGIN NOW worthy of it; so farewell." And the doors of the once happy home END
BEGIN NOW Let us feast and make merry in the pleasant summer-time," said END
BEGIN NOW So while the industrious bees were out among the flowers, he led END
BEGIN NOW So here dwelt Thistle, and many kind friends gathered round him, END
BEGIN NOW friends who had so kindly welcomed him looked upon him as an evil END
BEGIN NOW So poor Thistle lay sorrowfully, wondering what would come of it, END
BEGIN NOW You have done many cruel things, and caused much sorrow to happy END
BEGIN NOW solitude and darkness, till you have learned to find happiness in END
BEGIN NOW Then the Brownies bore him to a high, dark rock, and, entering a END
BEGIN NOW little door, led him to a small cell, dimly lighted by a crevice END
BEGIN NOW through which came a single gleam of sunlight; and there, through END
BEGIN NOW A little vine that grew outside his prison rock came creeping up, END
BEGIN NOW with his small share of water, that the little vine might live, END
BEGIN NOW even if it darkened more and more his dim cell. END
BEGIN NOW The watchful Brownies saw this kind deed, and brought him fresh END
BEGIN NOW Thus did poor Thistle strive to be more gentle and unselfish, and END
BEGIN NOW She healed the drooping flowers, cheered the Queen Bee's grief, END
BEGIN NOW Then Lily-Bell went seeking through the forest, listening for the END
BEGIN NOW music, and soon a distant voice mournfully singing,-- END
BEGIN NOW Bright shines the summer sun, END
BEGIN NOW Soft is the summer air; END
BEGIN NOW Gayly the wood-birds sing, END
BEGIN NOW Flowers are blooming fair. END
BEGIN NOW But, deep in the dark, cold rock, END
BEGIN NOW Sadly I dwell, END
BEGIN NOW Longing for thee, dear friend, END
BEGIN NOW Thistle, dear Thistle, where are you?" joyfully cried Lily-Bell, END
BEGIN NOW Through sunlight and summer air END
BEGIN NOW I have sought for thee long, END
BEGIN NOW Guided by birds and flowers, END
BEGIN NOW And now by thy song. END
BEGIN NOW O'er hill and dell END
BEGIN NOW Hither to comfort thee END
BEGIN NOW At last he besought the silent Brownie earnestly to tell him END
BEGIN NOW whither she had gone. END
BEGIN NOW Lily-Bell is safe," replied the Brownie; "come, you shall learn END
BEGIN NOW the trial that awaits you. END
BEGIN NOW The home of the Earth Spirits was the first to find, and no one END
BEGIN NOW On he went, thinking of Lily-Bell, and for her sake bearing all; END
BEGIN NOW But few believed him; for they remembered his false promises and END
BEGIN NOW Long he wandered, and carefully he sought; but could not find the END
BEGIN NOW Then he went among the flowers, but they closed their leaves, and END
BEGIN NOW among the leaves as he passed. END
BEGIN NOW This grieved poor Thistle, and he longed to tell them how changed END
BEGIN NOW And when the flowers saw this, and found the once cruel Elf now END
BEGIN NOW watering and tending little buds, feeding hungry insects, and END
BEGIN NOW But no rude hand tore her little ones away, no unkind words were END
BEGIN NOW kindness, and I would gladly repay all for the harm I have done; END
BEGIN NOW but none will love and trust me now. END
BEGIN NOW Then the little rose looked up, and while the dew-drops shone END
BEGIN NOW like happy tears upon her leaves, she said,-- END
BEGIN NOW I WILL love and trust you, Thistle, for you are indeed much END
BEGIN NOW Then the little buds raised their rosy faces, danced again upon END
BEGIN NOW trusted him when most forlorn and friendless. END
BEGIN NOW moonlight, so bitterly, I longed to speak a kindly word to him. END
BEGIN NOW Dear sisters, let us trust him. END
BEGIN NOW So they called a little bright-eyed mole, and said, Downy-Back, END
BEGIN NOW we have given you a pleasant home among our roots, and you are END
BEGIN NOW a grateful little friend; so will you guide dear Thistle to the END
BEGIN NOW Earth Spirits' home? END
BEGIN NOW Downy-Back said, "Yes," and Thistle, thanking the kindly flowers, END
BEGIN NOW Then they went quickly up the winding path, and Thistle, guided END
BEGIN NOW by the sweet music, went on alone. END
BEGIN NOW He soon reached a lovely spot, whose golden halls were bright END
BEGIN NOW to the melody of soft, silvery bells. END
BEGIN NOW Long Thistle stood watching the brilliant forms that flashed and END
BEGIN NOW sparkled round him; but he missed the flowers and the sunlight, END
BEGIN NOW and rejoiced that he was not an Earth Spirit. END
BEGIN NOW And Thistle said, "No task will be too hard for me to do for dear END
BEGIN NOW Then they led him to a strange, dark place, lit up with torches; END
BEGIN NOW I will tell," replied little Sparkle, "for I once worked here END
BEGIN NOW myself. Some of them watch above the flower-roots, and keep them END
BEGIN NOW Then Thistle went among the Spirits, and joined in their tasks; END
BEGIN NOW forest where Lily-Bell lay sleeping. END
BEGIN NOW You have done well," said he, "we hear good tidings of you from END
BEGIN NOW bird and flower, and you are truly seeking to repair the evil END
BEGIN NOW you have done. Take now one look at your little friend, and then END
BEGIN NOW Spirits; and if I deserve it, they will gladly aid me on my way. END
BEGIN NOW So he flew down into the field below, and hastened busily from END
BEGIN NOW flower to flower, till he had filled a tiny blue-bell with sweet, END
BEGIN NOW So each day Thistle filled a flower-cup, and laid it at the door; END
BEGIN NOW while all around the hive had grown fairer since the Fairy came. END
BEGIN NOW At length, as he lay sleeping in a flower-bell, a little bee came END
BEGIN NOW What shall we do to you, naughty Elf?" said they. "You are in END
BEGIN NOW our power, and we will sting you if you are not still. END
BEGIN NOW Let us close the flower-leaves around him and leave him here END
BEGIN NOW to starve," cried one, who had not yet forgotten all the sorrow END
BEGIN NOW Thistle had caused them long ago. END
BEGIN NOW Can this be naughty Thistle?" said Nimble-Wing. END
BEGIN NOW Little Hum joyfully obeyed; and Thistle followed him, as he flew END
BEGIN NOW Long Thistle wondered at the beauty round him; and then he went END
BEGIN NOW among the shining Spirits, told his tale, and asked a gift. END
BEGIN NOW into darkened places, and soft winds to refresh and cheer. END
BEGIN NOW These are the things we do," said they, "and you must aid us END
BEGIN NOW for a time. END
BEGIN NOW And Thistle gladly went with the lovely Spirits; by day he joined END
BEGIN NOW At length Star-Light bade him work no more, and gladly gave him END
BEGIN NOW Then with a light heart Thistle journeyed away to the brooks and END
BEGIN NOW rivers, seeking the Water Spirits. But he looked in vain; till, END
BEGIN NOW wandering through the forest where the Brownies took him captive, END
BEGIN NOW repayed by pain and sorrow, and who now lay suffering and alone. END
BEGIN NOW Thistle bent tenderly beside him, saying, "Dear Flutter, do not END
BEGIN NOW Day by day did Thistle watch beside him, making little beds of END
BEGIN NOW cool, fresh moss for him to rest upon, fanning him when he slept, END
BEGIN NOW poor Flutter longed to be dancing once again over the blue waves, END
BEGIN NOW farewell. END
BEGIN NOW Thistle followed the little brook, as it flowed through field and END
BEGIN NOW sorrow, and I will comfort you. END
BEGIN NOW So, spreading his great wings, he flew away, and soon Thistle saw END
BEGIN NOW Lofty arches of snow-white coral bent above him, and the walls END
BEGIN NOW snow-white pearls like those they wore. But Thistle had gained END
BEGIN NOW With a patient hope that he might yet be worthy of Lily-Bell, END
BEGIN NOW On through the fragrant air went Thistle, looking with glad face END
BEGIN NOW singing by, beneath the arching ferns that bent above it; green END
BEGIN NOW leaves rustled in the summer wind, and the air was full of music. END
BEGIN NOW velvet moss that Fairy hands had spread. The golden flower lay END
BEGIN NOW Happy tears fell fast, as Thistle folded his arms around her, END
BEGIN NOW Bird, bee, and blossom have forgiven him, and none is more loved END
BEGIN NOW And as the crown shone on the head that Lily-Bell bent down on END
BEGIN NOW Thistle's breast, the forest seemed alive with little forms, who END
BEGIN NOW If I am Queen, then you are King, dear Thistle," said the Fairy. END
BEGIN NOW As she ceased, down through the air came floating bands of lovely END
BEGIN NOW Have you a tale for us too, dear Violet-Eye?" said the Queen, as END
BEGIN NOW flower-leaves where she sat, and with a smile replied, "As I was END
BEGIN NOW weaving garlands in the field, I heard a primrose tell this tale END
BEGIN NOW to her friend Golden-Rod. END
BEGIN NOW IN a great forest, high up among the green boughs, lived Bird END
BEGIN NOW and little worms. END
BEGIN NOW The husband shook his head gravely, and said, "Be not alarmed, my END
BEGIN NOW a little maiden lay singing within. Then how amazed were they, END
BEGIN NOW Great joy was in the forest, and proud were the parents of their END
BEGIN NOW family, and still more of the little one who had come to them; END
BEGIN NOW while all the neighbors flocked in, to see Dame Brown-Breast's END
BEGIN NOW little child. And the tiny maiden talked to them, and sang so END
BEGIN NOW merrily, that they could have listened for ever. Soon she was END
BEGIN NOW the joy of the whole forest, dancing from tree to tree, making END
BEGIN NOW every nest her home, and none were ever so welcome as little Bud; END
BEGIN NOW The father now had much to do to supply his family with food, and END
BEGIN NOW in the turf, were friends to the merry child. END
BEGIN NOW And Bud said, "Yes," and they stayed; but her kind little heart END
BEGIN NOW Do not weep, and I will go to Queen Dew-Drop, and beseech her END
BEGIN NOW to let you come back. I will tell her that you are repentant, END
BEGIN NOW far away, and she must journey long. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, you shall not go on your feet, my child," said Mother END
BEGIN NOW Brown-Breast; "your friend Golden-Wing shall carry you. Call him END
BEGIN NOW my heart would break. END
BEGIN NOW little Bud was going to Fairy-Land. END
BEGIN NOW Then they all sang gayly together, till she passed out of sight END
BEGIN NOW over the hills, and they saw her no more. END
BEGIN NOW And now Bud left the old forest far behind her. Golden-Wing END
BEGIN NOW As Bud passed through the gates, she no longer wondered that the END
BEGIN NOW though the blossoms nodded gayly on their stems to welcome her, END
BEGIN NOW and the soft winds kissed her cheek, she would not stay, but on END
BEGIN NOW to the Flower Palace she went, into a pleasant hall whose walls END
BEGIN NOW were formed of crimson roses, amid whose leaves sat little Elves, END
BEGIN NOW With tearful eyes, Queen Dew-Drop replied,-- END
BEGIN NOW Day after day toiled little Bud, cheering the Fairies, who, END
BEGIN NOW angry and disappointed, would not listen to her gentle words, END
BEGIN NOW Then they planted the lilies; but they soon drooped and died, and END
BEGIN NOW blossoms, for she was striving to give happiness to others, END
BEGIN NOW maiden, who has toiled while you have wept, you never would have END
BEGIN NOW Time passed on, and the Fairies had done nothing to gain their END
BEGIN NOW lovely home again. They wept no longer, but watched little Bud, END
BEGIN NOW they followed her, and like a band of guardian spirits they flew END
BEGIN NOW far and wide, carrying with them joy and peace. END
BEGIN NOW But most tenderly did they watch over the poor and sorrowing, END
BEGIN NOW and many a poor mother blessed the unseen hands that laid food END
BEGIN NOW before her hungry little ones, and folded warm garments round END
BEGIN NOW their naked limbs. Many a poor man wondered at the fair flowers END
BEGIN NOW that sprang up in his little garden-plot, cheering him with their END
BEGIN NOW One day came little Bud to them, saying,-- END
BEGIN NOW Listen, dear friends. I have a hard task to offer you. It is a END
BEGIN NOW gratitude will give you happy homes among their bright leaves. END
BEGIN NOW Then deep in the earth the Fairies dwelt, and no frost or snow END
BEGIN NOW could harm the blossoms they tended. Every little seed was laid END
BEGIN NOW tenderly performed. END
BEGIN NOW Then came the merry birds, making the wood alive with their gay END
BEGIN NOW voices, calling to one another, as they flew among the vines, END
BEGIN NOW building their little homes. Long waited the Elves, and at last END
BEGIN NOW she came with Father Brown-Breast. Happy days passed; and END
BEGIN NOW Mounted on bright-winged butterflies, they flew over forest and END
BEGIN NOW meadow, till with joyful eyes they saw the flower-crowned walls END
BEGIN NOW Before the gates they stood, and soon troops of loving Elves END
BEGIN NOW happiness to their fair kindred. END
BEGIN NOW Are they not worthy of your love, dear Queen? Have they not won END
BEGIN NOW their lovely home? Say they are pardoned, and you have gained END
BEGIN NOW As Bud ceased, she touched the wondering Fairies with her wand, END
BEGIN NOW and the dark faded garments fell away; and beneath, the robes END
BEGIN NOW of lily-leaves glittered pure and spotless in the sun-light. END
BEGIN NOW the wands their own good deeds had rendered powerful. END
BEGIN NOW They turned to thank little Bud for all her patient love, END
BEGIN NOW but she was gone; and high above, in the clear air, they saw END
BEGIN NOW the little form journeying back to the quiet forest. END
BEGIN NOW She needed no reward but the joy she had given. The Fairy hearts END
BEGIN NOW Now, little Sunbeam, what have you to tell us?" said the Queen, END
BEGIN NOW I too, like Star-Twinkle, have nothing but a song to offer, END
BEGIN NOW replied the Fairy; and then, while the nightingale's sweet voice END
BEGIN NOW mingled with her own, she sang,-- END
BEGIN NOW IN a quiet, pleasant meadow, END
BEGIN NOW Beneath a summer sky, END
BEGIN NOW Where green old trees their branches waved, END
BEGIN NOW And winds went singing by; END
BEGIN NOW Where a little brook went rippling END
BEGIN NOW So musically low, END
BEGIN NOW And passing clouds cast shadows END
BEGIN NOW On the waving grass below; END
BEGIN NOW Where low, sweet notes of brooding birds END
BEGIN NOW Stole out on the fragrant air, END
BEGIN NOW And golden sunlight shone undimmed END
BEGIN NOW On all most fresh and fair;-- END
BEGIN NOW There bloomed a lovely sisterhood END
BEGIN NOW Of happy little flowers, END
BEGIN NOW Together in this pleasant home, END
BEGIN NOW Through quiet summer hours. END
BEGIN NOW No rude hand came to gather them, END
BEGIN NOW No chilling winds to blight; END
BEGIN NOW Warm sunbeams smiled on them by day, END
BEGIN NOW And soft dews fell at night. END
BEGIN NOW So here, along the brook-side, END
BEGIN NOW Beneath the green old trees, END
BEGIN NOW The flowers dwelt among their friends, END
BEGIN NOW The sunbeams and the breeze. END
BEGIN NOW One morning, as the flowers awoke, END
BEGIN NOW Fragrant, and fresh, and fair, END
BEGIN NOW A little worm came creeping by, END
BEGIN NOW And begged a shelter there. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! pity and love me," sighed the worm, END
BEGIN NOW I am lonely, poor, and weak; END
BEGIN NOW A little spot for a resting-place, END
BEGIN NOW Dear flowers, is all I seek. END
BEGIN NOW I am not fair, and have dwelt unloved END
BEGIN NOW By butterfly, bird, and bee. END
BEGIN NOW They little knew that in this dark form END
BEGIN NOW Lay the beauty they yet may see. END
BEGIN NOW Then let me lie in the deep green moss, END
BEGIN NOW And weave my little tomb, END
BEGIN NOW And sleep my long, unbroken sleep END
BEGIN NOW Till Spring's first flowers come. END
BEGIN NOW Then will I come in a fairer dress, END
BEGIN NOW And your gentle care repay END
BEGIN NOW By the grateful love of the humble worm; END
BEGIN NOW Kind flowers, O let me stay! END
BEGIN NOW But the wild rose showed her little thorns, END
BEGIN NOW While her soft face glowed with pride; END
BEGIN NOW The violet hid beneath the drooping ferns, END
BEGIN NOW And the daisy turned aside. END
BEGIN NOW Little Houstonia scornfully laughed, END
BEGIN NOW As she danced on her slender stem; END
BEGIN NOW While the cowslip bent to the rippling waves, END
BEGIN NOW And whispered the tale to them. END
BEGIN NOW A blue-eyed grass looked down on the worm, END
BEGIN NOW As it silently turned away, END
BEGIN NOW And cried, "Thou wilt harm our delicate leaves, END
BEGIN NOW And therefore thou canst not stay. END
BEGIN NOW Then a sweet, soft voice, called out from far, END
BEGIN NOW Come hither, poor worm, to me; END
BEGIN NOW The sun lies warm in this quiet spot, END
BEGIN NOW And I'll share my home with thee. END
BEGIN NOW The wondering flowers looked up to see END
BEGIN NOW Who had offered the worm a home: END
BEGIN NOW 'T was a clover-blossom, whose fluttering leaves END
BEGIN NOW Seemed beckoning him to come; END
BEGIN NOW It dwelt in a sunny little nook, END
BEGIN NOW Where cool winds rustled by, END
BEGIN NOW And murmuring bees and butterflies came, END
BEGIN NOW On the flower's breast to lie. END
BEGIN NOW Down through the leaves the sunlight stole, END
BEGIN NOW And seemed to linger there, END
BEGIN NOW As if it loved to brighten the home END
BEGIN NOW Of one so sweet and fair. END
BEGIN NOW Its rosy face smiled kindly down, END
BEGIN NOW As the friendless worm drew near; END
BEGIN NOW And its low voice, softly whispering, said END
BEGIN NOW Poor thing, thou art welcome here; END
BEGIN NOW Close at my side, in the soft green moss, END
BEGIN NOW Thou wilt find a quiet bed, END
BEGIN NOW Where thou canst softly sleep till Spring, END
BEGIN NOW With my leaves above thee spread. END
BEGIN NOW I pity and love thee, friendless worm, END
BEGIN NOW Though thou art not graceful or fair; END
BEGIN NOW For many a dark, unlovely form, END
BEGIN NOW Hath a kind heart dwelling there; END
BEGIN NOW No more o'er the green and pleasant earth, END
BEGIN NOW Lonely and poor, shalt thou roam, END
BEGIN NOW For a loving friend hast thou found in me, END
BEGIN NOW And rest in my little home. END
BEGIN NOW Then, deep in its quiet mossy bed, END
BEGIN NOW Sheltered from sun and shower, END
BEGIN NOW The grateful worm spun its winter tomb, END
BEGIN NOW In the shadow of the flower. END
BEGIN NOW And Clover guarded well its rest, END
BEGIN NOW Till Autumn's leaves were sere, END
BEGIN NOW Till all her sister flowers were gone, END
BEGIN NOW And her winter sleep drew near. END
BEGIN NOW Then her withered leaves were softly spread END
BEGIN NOW O'er the sleeping worm below, END
BEGIN NOW Ere the faithful little flower lay END
BEGIN NOW Beneath the winter snow. END
BEGIN NOW Spring came again, and the flowers rose END
BEGIN NOW From their quiet winter graves, END
BEGIN NOW And gayly danced on their slender stems, END
BEGIN NOW And sang with the rippling waves. END
BEGIN NOW Softly the warm winds kissed their cheeks; END
BEGIN NOW Brightly the sunbeams fell, END
BEGIN NOW As, one by one, they came again END
BEGIN NOW In their summer homes to dwell. END
BEGIN NOW And little Clover bloomed once more, END
BEGIN NOW Rosy, and sweet, and fair, END
BEGIN NOW And patiently watched by the mossy bed, END
BEGIN NOW For the worm still slumbered there. END
BEGIN NOW Then her sister flowers scornfully cried, END
BEGIN NOW As they waved in the summer air, END
BEGIN NOW The ugly worm was friendless and poor; END
BEGIN NOW Little Clover, why shouldst thou care? END
BEGIN NOW Then watch no more, nor dwell alone, END
BEGIN NOW Away from thy sister flowers; END
BEGIN NOW Come, dance and feast, and spend with us END
BEGIN NOW These pleasant summer hours. END
BEGIN NOW We pity thee, foolish little flower, END
BEGIN NOW To trust what the false worm said; END
BEGIN NOW He will not come in a fairer dress, END
BEGIN NOW For he lies in the green moss dead. END
BEGIN NOW But little Clover still watched on, END
BEGIN NOW Alone in her sunny home; END
BEGIN NOW She did not doubt the poor worm's truth, END
BEGIN NOW And trusted he would come. END
BEGIN NOW At last the small cell opened wide, END
BEGIN NOW And a glittering butterfly, END
BEGIN NOW From out the moss, on golden wings, END
BEGIN NOW Soared up to the sunny sky. END
BEGIN NOW Then the wondering flowers cried aloud, END
BEGIN NOW Clover, thy watch was vain; END
BEGIN NOW He only sought a shelter here, END
BEGIN NOW And never will come again. END
BEGIN NOW And the unkind flowers danced for joy, END
BEGIN NOW When they saw him thus depart; END
BEGIN NOW For the love of a beautiful butterfly END
BEGIN NOW Is dear to a flower's heart. END
BEGIN NOW They feared he would stay in Clover's home, END
BEGIN NOW And her tender care repay; END
BEGIN NOW So they danced for joy, when at last he rose END
BEGIN NOW And silently flew away. END
BEGIN NOW Then little Clover bowed her head, END
BEGIN NOW While her soft tears fell like dew; END
BEGIN NOW For her gentle heart was grieved, to find END
BEGIN NOW That her sisters' words were true, END
BEGIN NOW And the insect she had watched so long END
BEGIN NOW When helpless, poor, and lone, END
BEGIN NOW Thankless for all her faithful care, END
BEGIN NOW On his golden wings had flown. END
BEGIN NOW But as she drooped, in silent grief, END
BEGIN NOW She heard little Daisy cry, END
BEGIN NOW O sisters, look! I see him now, END
BEGIN NOW Afar in the sunny sky; END
BEGIN NOW He is floating back from Cloud-Land now, END
BEGIN NOW Borne by the fragrant air. END
BEGIN NOW Spread wide your leaves, that he may choose END
BEGIN NOW The flower he deems most fair. END
BEGIN NOW Then the wild rose glowed with a deeper blush, END
BEGIN NOW As she proudly waved on her stem; END
BEGIN NOW The Cowslip bent to the clear blue waves, END
BEGIN NOW And made her mirror of them. END
BEGIN NOW Little Houstonia merrily danced, END
BEGIN NOW And spread her white leaves wide; END
BEGIN NOW While Daisy whispered her joy and hope, END
BEGIN NOW As she stood by her gay friends' side. END
BEGIN NOW Violet peeped from the tall green ferns, END
BEGIN NOW And lifted her soft blue eye END
BEGIN NOW To watch the glittering form, that shone END
BEGIN NOW Afar in the summer sky. END
BEGIN NOW They thought no more of the ugly worm, END
BEGIN NOW Who once had wakened their scorn; END
BEGIN NOW But looked and longed for the butterfly now, END
BEGIN NOW As the soft wind bore him on. END
BEGIN NOW Nearer and nearer the bright form came, END
BEGIN NOW And fairer the blossoms grew; END
BEGIN NOW Each welcomed him, in her sweetest tones; END
BEGIN NOW Each offered her honey and dew. END
BEGIN NOW But in vain did they beckon, and smile, and call, END
BEGIN NOW And wider their leaves unclose; END
BEGIN NOW The glittering form still floated on, END
BEGIN NOW Lightly it flew to the pleasant home END
BEGIN NOW Of the flower most truly fair, END
BEGIN NOW On Clover's breast he softly lit, END
BEGIN NOW And folded his bright wings there. END
BEGIN NOW Dear flower," the butterfly whispered low, END
BEGIN NOW Long hast thou waited for me; END
BEGIN NOW Now I am come, and my grateful love END
BEGIN NOW Shall brighten thy home for thee; END
BEGIN NOW Thou hast loved and cared for me, when alone, END
BEGIN NOW Hast watched o'er me long and well; END
BEGIN NOW And now will I strive to show the thanks END
BEGIN NOW The poor worm could not tell. END
BEGIN NOW Sunbeam and breeze shall come to thee, END
BEGIN NOW And the coolest dews that fall; END
BEGIN NOW Whate'er a flower can wish is thine, END
BEGIN NOW For thou art worthy all. END
BEGIN NOW And the home thou shared with the friendless worm END
BEGIN NOW The butterfly's home shall be; END
BEGIN NOW And thou shalt find, dear, faithful flower, END
BEGIN NOW A loving friend in me. END
BEGIN NOW Then, through the long, bright summer hours END
BEGIN NOW Through sunshine and through shower, END
BEGIN NOW Together in their happy home END
BEGIN NOW Dwelt butterfly and flower. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, that is very lovely," cried the Elves, gathering round END
BEGIN NOW little Sunbeam as she ceased, to place a garland in her hair and END
BEGIN NOW praise her song. END
BEGIN NOW Now, said the Queen, "call hither Moon-light and Summer-Wind, END
BEGIN NOW for they have seen many pleasant things in their long wanderings, END
BEGIN NOW Most joyfully will we do our best, dear Queen," said the Elves, END
BEGIN NOW as they folded their wings beside her. END
BEGIN NOW IN a large and pleasant garden sat little Annie all alone, and END
BEGIN NOW or wind, or flower; still the bright tears fell, and she forgot END
BEGIN NOW all but her sorrow. END
BEGIN NOW vine-leaf at her side; a lovely face smiled on her, from amid END
BEGIN NOW Who are you, lovely little thing?" cried Annie, smiling through END
BEGIN NOW her tears. END
BEGIN NOW And are you really, then, a little Elf, such as I read of END
BEGIN NOW Yes, all these things I do, and many stranger still, that all END
BEGIN NOW Ah, you will not love me any more if I should tell you all, END
BEGIN NOW said Annie, while the tears began to fall again; "I am not happy, END
BEGIN NOW Gladly will I aid you, Annie, and if you truly wish to be END
BEGIN NOW a happy child, you first must learn to conquer many passions that END
BEGIN NOW holds it there. END
BEGIN NOW As thus she spoke, the Elf took from her bosom a graceful flower, END
BEGIN NOW a sweet reward. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot stay now, little Annie," said the Elf, "but when END
BEGIN NOW be faithful to yourself, and the magic flower will never fade. END
BEGIN NOW Then the gentle Fairy folded her little arms around Annie's neck, END
BEGIN NOW The pleasant days of Spring and Summer passed away, and in END
BEGIN NOW little Annie's garden Autumn flowers were blooming everywhere, END
BEGIN NOW When first the Fairy placed it there, she had been pleased with END
BEGIN NOW sadder peal. Then she paid no heed to the silvery music sounding END
BEGIN NOW One sunny morning, when the fresh, cool Winds were blowing, END
BEGIN NOW Little Annie looked, searched, and asked them all if any one END
BEGIN NOW could tell her of the Fairy whom she sought; but the birds looked END
BEGIN NOW Then she went through broad fields of yellow grain, that waved END
BEGIN NOW she longed to know. END
BEGIN NOW Now will I go among the hills," said Annie, "she may be there. END
BEGIN NOW her long and useless search, she sat amid the ferns, and feasted END
BEGIN NOW on the rosy strawberries that grew beside her, watching meanwhile END
BEGIN NOW The night-wind rustled through the boughs, rocking the flowers END
BEGIN NOW to sleep; the wild birds sang their evening hymns, and all within END
BEGIN NOW And all night long beside her stood the Fairy she had sought, and END
BEGIN NOW Little Annie dreamed she sat in her own garden, as she had often END
BEGIN NOW becomes, unless you banish them for ever. END
BEGIN NOW scornfully away from all the rest. These and many others END
BEGIN NOW strange power over her. She could not drive them from her sight, END
BEGIN NOW a faint, soft light, and on her breast she saw her fairy flower, END
BEGIN NOW upon whose snow-white leaves her tears lay shining. END
BEGIN NOW The light and perfume of the flower seemed to bring new strength END
BEGIN NOW Then in her dream she felt how hard the spirits tried to tempt END
BEGIN NOW and trouble her, and how, but for her flower, they would have led END
BEGIN NOW she struggled, and tears often fell; but after each new trial, END
BEGIN NOW till one by one the evil spirits fled away, and in their place END
BEGIN NOW Then the low voice spoke again in Annie's sleeping ear, saying, END
BEGIN NOW make your heart their home. END
BEGIN NOW Meanwhile the forest was astir, birds sang their gay good-morrows END
BEGIN NOW thought or feeling fled away, the smiling spirits of gentleness END
BEGIN NOW and love nestled in her heart, and all was bright again. END
BEGIN NOW So better and happier grew the child, fairer and sweeter grew the END
BEGIN NOW At length, one day, as she sat singing in the sunny nook where END
BEGIN NOW spread wide apart, and, rising slowly from the deep white cup, END
BEGIN NOW appeared the smiling face of the lovely Elf whose coming she had END
BEGIN NOW waited for so long. END
BEGIN NOW Dear Annie, look for me no longer; I am here on your own breast, END
BEGIN NOW most faithfully and well," the Fairy said, as she looked into the END
BEGIN NOW in her breast. END
BEGIN NOW for the gentle, happy child, whose bosom flower will never fade. END
BEGIN NOW And now, dear Annie, I must go; but every Springtime, with the END
BEGIN NOW earliest flowers, will I come again to visit you, and bring END
BEGIN NOW Then, with a kind farewell, the gentle Fairy floated upward END
BEGIN NOW in the many-colored shells upon the shore, listening to the low, END
BEGIN NOW murmuring music the waves had taught them long ago; and here END
BEGIN NOW for hours the little Spirit lay watching the sea and sky, while END
BEGIN NOW singing gayly to herself. END
BEGIN NOW sparkled in the sand. END
BEGIN NOW This was Ripple's only grief, and she often thought of those who END
BEGIN NOW When Ripple saw the mother's grief, she longed to comfort her; END
BEGIN NOW so, bending tenderly beside her, where she knelt upon the shore, END
BEGIN NOW Most gladly will I help you if I can, though I have little power END
BEGIN NOW promise she had made. END
BEGIN NOW Good little Ripple," said the Queen, when she had told her all, END
BEGIN NOW your promise never can be kept; there is no power below the sea END
BEGIN NOW tell me the path, and let me go. END
BEGIN NOW It is far, far away, high up above the sun, where no Spirit ever END
BEGIN NOW But Ripple would not break the promise she had made, and besought END
BEGIN NOW I will search the broad earth till I find a path up to the sun, END
BEGIN NOW Long she journeyed through the pathless ocean, with no friends END
BEGIN NOW to cheer her, save the white sea-birds who went sweeping by, and END
BEGIN NOW only stayed to dip their wide wings at her side, and then flew END
BEGIN NOW silently away. Sometimes great ships sailed by, and then with END
BEGIN NOW floated on her way, and left them far behind. END
BEGIN NOW nodded and smiled on the Spirit. END
BEGIN NOW I will ask Spring where the Fire-Spirits dwell; she travels over END
BEGIN NOW Dear Spring, will you listen, and help a poor little Spirit, END
BEGIN NOW The Fire-Spirits' home is far, far away, and I cannot guide you END
BEGIN NOW calling me far and wide, and I cannot stay. END
BEGIN NOW Now I must seek for Summer," said Ripple, as she sailed slowly END
BEGIN NOW through the sunny sky. END
BEGIN NOW a warm, bright glow on all beneath. END
BEGIN NOW Then Ripple told her tale, and asked where she should go; but END
BEGIN NOW Summer answered,-- END
BEGIN NOW And Summer, giving her the sunbeam, passed away over the distant END
BEGIN NOW hills, leaving all green and bright behind her. END
BEGIN NOW So Ripple journeyed on again, till the earth below her shone END
BEGIN NOW with yellow harvests waving in the sun, and the air was filled END
BEGIN NOW with cheerful voices, as the reapers sang among the fields or in END
BEGIN NOW the pleasant vineyards, where purple fruit hung gleaming through END
BEGIN NOW the leaves; while the sky above was cloudless, and the changing END
BEGIN NOW But when the wandering Spirit came to her, and asked for what she END
BEGIN NOW What do you seek with me, fair little Spirit, that you come END
BEGIN NOW so bravely here amid my ice and snow? Do not fear me; I am warm END
BEGIN NOW But Ripple said, "I cannot turn back now, when I am nearly there. END
BEGIN NOW Adieu, little Ripple! May good angels watch above you! Journey END
BEGIN NOW tossed, like great waves, to and fro. END
BEGIN NOW Soon the cold vapors vanished from her path, and sunshine shone END
BEGIN NOW upon her pleasantly; so she went gayly on, till she came up among END
BEGIN NOW The Fire-Spirits surely must be there, and I must stay no longer END
BEGIN NOW Through the red mist that floated all around her, she could see END
BEGIN NOW steady flame, that never wavered or went out. END
BEGIN NOW As thus she stood, the Spirits gathered round her, and their END
BEGIN NOW hot breath would have scorched her, but she drew the snow-cloak END
BEGIN NOW closer round her, saying,-- END
BEGIN NOW So, through long halls of many-colored fire, they led her to END
BEGIN NOW within her breast glowed bright and strong. END
BEGIN NOW This is our Queen," the Spirits said, bending low before her, END
BEGIN NOW Then Ripple told how she had wandered round the world in search END
BEGIN NOW of them, how the Seasons had most kindly helped her on, by giving END
BEGIN NOW When she had told her tale, the spirits whispered earnestly END
BEGIN NOW But Ripple asked no other boon, and, weeping sadly, begged them END
BEGIN NOW I have many fairer gems than these, in my home below the sea; END
BEGIN NOW and I will bring all I can gather far and wide, if you will grant END
BEGIN NOW the fiery Spirits, who were hovering fiercely round her. END
BEGIN NOW fail not to return, or we shall seek you out. END
BEGIN NOW forgot all else, and told the Spirits what they asked most surely END
BEGIN NOW it shone and glittered like a star. END
BEGIN NOW So, down along the shining path, through mist and cloud, she END
BEGIN NOW Gladly she plunged into the clear, cool waves, and floated back END
BEGIN NOW Then Ripple sang for joy, and, with her sister Spirits, robed the END
BEGIN NOW So up they went, through foam and spray, till on the beach, where END
BEGIN NOW See, dear mother, I am come; and look what lovely things the END
BEGIN NOW gentle Spirits gave, that I might seem more beautiful to you. END
BEGIN NOW O faithful little Spirit! I would gladly give some precious gift END
BEGIN NOW And now another task was to be done; her promise to the END
BEGIN NOW Fire-Spirits must be kept. So far and wide she searched among END
BEGIN NOW shining there; and then upon her faithful Breeze once more went END
BEGIN NOW journeying through the sky. END
BEGIN NOW The Spirits gladly welcomed her, and led her to the Queen, END
BEGIN NOW before whom she poured out the sparkling gems she had gathered END
BEGIN NOW with such toil and care; but when the Spirits tried to form them END
BEGIN NOW Fire-Spirits looked upon her angrily, and when she begged them END
BEGIN NOW to be merciful, and let her try once more, saying,-- END
BEGIN NOW Do not keep me prisoner here. I cannot breathe the flames that END
BEGIN NOW for the child. END
BEGIN NOW And Ripple, safe again beneath her snow flake, gladly gave END
BEGIN NOW the chain to them; and told them how the pearls they now placed END
BEGIN NOW proudly on their breasts were formed of tears, which but for them END
BEGIN NOW like a wound to her. END
BEGIN NOW Then, if we may not tell our pleasure so, we will show it in a END
BEGIN NOW a lovely rainbow arched its radiant colors in the sun. END
BEGIN NOW This is indeed a pleasant road," said Ripple. "Thank you, END
BEGIN NOW Then down along the shining pathway spread before her, the happy END
BEGIN NOW little Spirit glided to the sea. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks, dear Summer-Wind," said the Queen; "we will remember the END
BEGIN NOW The moonlight fades from flower and tree, END
BEGIN NOW And the stars dim one by one; END
BEGIN NOW The tale is told, the song is sung, END
BEGIN NOW And the Fairy feast is done. END
BEGIN NOW The night-wind rocks the sleeping flowers, END
BEGIN NOW And sings to them, soft and low. END
BEGIN NOW The early birds erelong will wake: END
BEGIN NOW 'T is time for the Elves to go. END
BEGIN NOW O'er the sleeping earth we silently pass, END
BEGIN NOW Unseen by mortal eye, END

BEGIN NOW Through the quiet moonlit sky;-- END
BEGIN NOW For the stars' soft eyes alone may see, END

BEGIN NOW One by one I dismayed them, frighting them sore with my glooms; END
BEGIN NOW One by one I betrayed them unto my manifold dooms. END
BEGIN NOW Going outside with an escort, raving with lips all afoam, END
BEGIN NOW Writing a cheque for a million, driveling feebly of home; END
BEGIN NOW Lost like a louse in the burning... or else in the tented town END
BEGIN NOW Seeking a drunkard's solace, sinking and sinking down; END

BEGIN NOW Shooting the wrath of my rapids, scaling my ramparts of snow; END
BEGIN NOW Ripping the guts of my mountains, looting the beds of my creeks, END
BEGIN NOW Them will I take to my bosom, and speak as a mother speaks. END
BEGIN NOW I am the land that listens, I am the land that broods; END
BEGIN NOW Steeped in eternal beauty, crystalline waters and woods. END
BEGIN NOW Long have I waited lonely, shunned as a thing accurst, END
BEGIN NOW Monstrous, moody, pathetic, the last of the lands and the first; END
BEGIN NOW Visioning camp-fires at twilight, sad with a longing forlorn, END
BEGIN NOW Feeling my womb o'er-pregnant with the seed of cities unborn. END
BEGIN NOW Wild and wide are my borders, stern as death is my sway, END
BEGIN NOW Them will I gild with my treasure, them will I glut with my meat. END
BEGIN NOW Lofty I stand from each sister land, patient and wearily wise, END
BEGIN NOW When men shall not rape my riches, and curse me and go away; END
BEGIN NOW Making a bawd of my bounty, fouling the hand that gave -- END
BEGIN NOW Till I rise in my wrath and I sweep on their path END
BEGIN NOW and I stamp them into a grave. END
BEGIN NOW Dreaming of men who will bless me, of women esteeming me good, END
BEGIN NOW Of children born in my borders of radiant motherhood, END
BEGIN NOW Of cities leaping to stature, of fame like a flag unfurled, END
BEGIN NOW As I pour the tide of my riches in the eager lap of the world. END

BEGIN NOW and the town all open wide! END
BEGIN NOW (If God made me in His likeness, sure He let the devil inside.) END
BEGIN NOW Money was just like dirt there, easy to get and to spend. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty years in the Yukon, struggling along its creeks; END

BEGIN NOW Searched the Vastness for a something you have lost? END
BEGIN NOW Have you wandered in the wilderness, the sagebrush desolation, END
BEGIN NOW The bunch-grass levels where the cattle graze? END

BEGIN NOW We sleep in the sleep of ages, the bleak, barbarian pines; END
BEGIN NOW The gray moss drapes us like sages, and closer we lock our lines, END
BEGIN NOW Ours till the world be riven in the crash of the utter end; END
BEGIN NOW Wind of the East, Wind of the West, wandering to and fro, END

BEGIN NOW to the peaks that tusk the sky, END

BEGIN NOW They miss my little camp-fires, ever brightly, bravely gleaming END
BEGIN NOW In the womb of desolation, where was never man before; END
BEGIN NOW As comradeless I sought them, lion-hearted, loving, dreaming, END
BEGIN NOW And they hailed me as a comrade, and they loved me evermore. END
BEGIN NOW And now they're all a-crying, and it's no use me denying; END
BEGIN NOW The spell of them is on me and I'm helpless as a child; END
BEGIN NOW My heart is aching, aching, but I hear them, sleeping, waking; END
BEGIN NOW It's the Lure of Little Voices, it's the mandate of the Wild. END
BEGIN NOW I'm afraid to tell you, Honey, I can take no bitter leaving; END
BEGIN NOW But softly in the sleep-time from your love I'll steal away. END
BEGIN NOW Look at my face, toil-furrowed; look at my calloused hands; END
BEGIN NOW Master, I've done Thy bidding, wrought in Thy many lands -- END
BEGIN NOW Wrought for the little masters, big-bellied they be, and rich; END
BEGIN NOW And now, Big Master, I'm broken and bent and twisted and scarred, END
BEGIN NOW Whiskey and cards and women, they made me the devil's tool. END
BEGIN NOW I was just like a child with money; I flung it away with a curse, END
BEGIN NOW Then back to the woods repentant, back to the mill or the mine, END
BEGIN NOW I, the worker of workers, everything in my line. END
BEGIN NOW Everything hard but headwork (I'd no more brains than a kid), END

BEGIN NOW The Shooting of Dan McGrew END

BEGIN NOW Back of the bar, in a solo game, sat Dangerous Dan McGrew, END
BEGIN NOW and scarcely the strength of a louse, END

BEGIN NOW and he called for drinks for the house. END
BEGIN NOW There was none could place the stranger's face, END

BEGIN NOW There's men that somehow just grip your eyes, END
BEGIN NOW and hold them hard like a spell; END
BEGIN NOW And I turned my head -- and there watching him END

BEGIN NOW of all that it once held dear; END
BEGIN NOW and it thrilled you through and through -- END
BEGIN NOW The music almost died away... then it burst like a pent-up flood; END
BEGIN NOW then the music stopped with a crash, END
BEGIN NOW and he spoke, and his voice was calm, END
BEGIN NOW and I'll bet my poke they're true, END
BEGIN NOW Then I ducked my head, and the lights went out, END
BEGIN NOW and two guns blazed in the dark, END
BEGIN NOW And a woman screamed, and the lights went up, END
BEGIN NOW and two men lay stiff and stark. END
BEGIN NOW of the lady that's known as Lou. END
BEGIN NOW and I'm not denying it's so. END

BEGIN NOW The Cremation of Sam McGee END

BEGIN NOW Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge END
BEGIN NOW I cremated Sam McGee._ END
BEGIN NOW On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail. END
BEGIN NOW Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; END
BEGIN NOW then he says with a sort of moan: END
BEGIN NOW It's the cursed cold, and it's got right hold END
BEGIN NOW till I'm chilled clean through to the bone. END
BEGIN NOW You may tax your brawn and brains, END
BEGIN NOW in my heart how I cursed that load. END
BEGIN NOW In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, END
BEGIN NOW while the huskies, round in a ring, END
BEGIN NOW Howled out their woes to the homeless snows -- END
BEGIN NOW O God! how I loathed the thing. END
BEGIN NOW And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow; END
BEGIN NOW such a blaze you seldom see; END
BEGIN NOW Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so; END
BEGIN NOW down my cheeks, and I don't know why; END
BEGIN NOW I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear; END
BEGIN NOW then the door I opened wide. END
BEGIN NOW and he said: "Please close that door. END

BEGIN NOW Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge END
BEGIN NOW I cremated Sam McGee._ END
BEGIN NOW I haled me a woman from the street, END
BEGIN NOW Shameless, but, oh, so fair! END
BEGIN NOW I bade her sit in the model's seat END
BEGIN NOW And I painted her sitting there. END
BEGIN NOW I hid all trace of her heart unclean; END
BEGIN NOW I painted a babe at her breast; END
BEGIN NOW I painted her as she might have been END
BEGIN NOW If the Worst had been the Best. END
BEGIN NOW She laughed at my picture and went away. END
BEGIN NOW Then came, with a knowing nod, END
BEGIN NOW A connoisseur, and I heard him say; END
BEGIN NOW So I painted a halo round her hair, END
BEGIN NOW And I sold her and took my fee, END
BEGIN NOW And she hangs in the church of Saint Hillaire, END
BEGIN NOW Where you and all may see. END
BEGIN NOW I know a garden where the lilies gleam, END
BEGIN NOW And one who lingers in the sunshine there; END
BEGIN NOW She is than white-stoled lily far more fair, END
BEGIN NOW And oh, her eyes are heaven-lit with dream! END
BEGIN NOW I know a garret, cold and dark and drear, END
BEGIN NOW And one who toils and toils with tireless pen, END
BEGIN NOW Until his brave, sad eyes grow weary -- then END
BEGIN NOW He seeks the stars, pale, silent as a seer. END
BEGIN NOW And ah, it's strange; for, desolate and dim, END
BEGIN NOW Between these two there rolls an ocean wide; END
BEGIN NOW Yet he is in the garden by her side END
BEGIN NOW And she is in the garret there with him. END
BEGIN NOW It's fine to have a blow-out in a fancy restaurant, END
BEGIN NOW With terrapin and canvas-back and all the wine you want; END
BEGIN NOW To enjoy the flowers and music, watch the pretty women pass, END
BEGIN NOW Smoke a choice cigar, and sip the wealthy water in your glass. END
BEGIN NOW It's bully in a high-toned joint to eat and drink your fill, END
BEGIN NOW But it's quite another matter when you END
BEGIN NOW Pay the bill. END
BEGIN NOW It's great to go out every night on fun or pleasure bent; END
BEGIN NOW To wear your glad rags always and to never save a cent; END
BEGIN NOW To drift along regardless, have a good time every trip; END
BEGIN NOW To hit the high spots sometimes, and to let your chances slip; END
BEGIN NOW To know you're acting foolish, yet to go on fooling still, END
BEGIN NOW Till Nature calls a show-down, and you END
BEGIN NOW Pay the bill. END
BEGIN NOW Time has got a little bill -- get wise while yet you may, END
BEGIN NOW For the debit side's increasing in a most alarming way; END
BEGIN NOW So eat, drink and be merry, have a good time if you will, END
BEGIN NOW But God help you when the time comes, and you END
BEGIN NOW Foot the bill. END
BEGIN NOW One said: Thy life is thine to make or mar, END
BEGIN NOW To flicker feebly, or to soar, a star; END
BEGIN NOW It lies with thee -- the choice is thine, is thine, END
BEGIN NOW To hit the ties or drive thy auto-car. END
BEGIN NOW I answered Her: The choice is mine -- ah, no! END
BEGIN NOW We all were made or marred long, long ago. END
BEGIN NOW The parts are written; hear the super wail: END
BEGIN NOW Who is stage-managing this cosmic show? END
BEGIN NOW Blind fools of fate and slaves of circumstance, END
BEGIN NOW Life is a fiddler, and we all must dance. END
BEGIN NOW From gloom where mocks that will-o'-wisp, Free-will END
BEGIN NOW I heard a voice cry: "Say, give us a chance. END
BEGIN NOW Chance! Oh, there is no chance! The scene is set. END
BEGIN NOW Up with the curtain! Man, the marionette, END
BEGIN NOW Resumes his part. The gods will work the wires. END
BEGIN NOW They've got it all down fine, you bet, you bet! END
BEGIN NOW It's all decreed -- the mighty earthquake crash, END
BEGIN NOW The countless constellations' wheel and flash; END
BEGIN NOW The rise and fall of empires, war's red tide; END
BEGIN NOW The composition of your dinner hash. END
BEGIN NOW There's no haphazard in this world of ours. END
BEGIN NOW Cause and effect are grim, relentless powers. END
BEGIN NOW They rule the world. (A king was shot last night; END
BEGIN NOW Last night I held the joker and both bowers.) END
BEGIN NOW From out the mesh of fate our heads we thrust. END
BEGIN NOW We can't do what we would, but what we must. END
BEGIN NOW Heredity has got us in a cinch -- END
BEGIN NOW (Consoling thought when you've been on a bust".) END
BEGIN NOW Hark to the song where spheral voices blend: END

BEGIN NOW It makes us nutty; hang the astral chimes! END
BEGIN NOW The tables spread; come, let us dine, my friend. END
BEGIN NOW The Men That Don't Fit In END
BEGIN NOW There's a race of men that don't fit in, END
BEGIN NOW A race that can't stay still; END
BEGIN NOW So they break the hearts of kith and kin, END
BEGIN NOW And they roam the world at will. END
BEGIN NOW They range the field and they rove the flood, END
BEGIN NOW And they climb the mountain's crest; END
BEGIN NOW And they don't know how to rest. END
BEGIN NOW If they just went straight they might go far; END
BEGIN NOW They are strong and brave and true; END
BEGIN NOW But they're always tired of the things that are, END
BEGIN NOW And they want the strange and new. END
BEGIN NOW They say: "Could I find my proper groove, END
BEGIN NOW What a deep mark I would make! END
BEGIN NOW So they chop and change, and each fresh move END
BEGIN NOW Is only a fresh mistake. END
BEGIN NOW And each forgets, as he strips and runs END
BEGIN NOW With a brilliant, fitful pace, END
BEGIN NOW It's the steady, quiet, plodding ones END
BEGIN NOW Who win in the lifelong race. END
BEGIN NOW And each forgets that his youth has fled, END
BEGIN NOW Forgets that his prime is past, END
BEGIN NOW Till he stands one day, with a hope that's dead, END
BEGIN NOW In the glare of the truth at last. END
BEGIN NOW He has failed, he has failed; he has missed his chance; END
BEGIN NOW He has just done things by half. END
BEGIN NOW Life's been a jolly good joke on him, END
BEGIN NOW And now is the time to laugh. END
BEGIN NOW He was never meant to win; END
BEGIN NOW He's a rolling stone, and it's bred in the bone; END
BEGIN NOW He's a man who won't fit in. END
BEGIN NOW O'er the dark pines she sees the silver moon, END
BEGIN NOW And in the west, all tremulous, a star; END
BEGIN NOW And soothing sweet she hears the mellow tune END
BEGIN NOW Of cow-bells jangled in the fields afar. END
BEGIN NOW Quite listless, for her daily stent is done, END
BEGIN NOW She stands, sad exile, at her rose-wreathed door, END
BEGIN NOW And sends her love eternal with the sun END
BEGIN NOW That goes to gild the land she'll see no more. END
BEGIN NOW The grave, gaunt pines imprison her sad gaze, END
BEGIN NOW All still the sky and darkling drearily; END
BEGIN NOW She feels the chilly breath of dear, dead days END
BEGIN NOW Come sifting through the alders eerily. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, how the roses riot in their bloom! END
BEGIN NOW The curtains stir as with an ancient pain; END
BEGIN NOW Her old piano gleams from out the gloom END
BEGIN NOW And waits and waits her tender touch in vain. END
BEGIN NOW But now her hands like moonlight brush the keys END
BEGIN NOW With velvet grace -- melodious delight; END
BEGIN NOW And now a sad refrain from over seas END
BEGIN NOW Goes sobbing on the bosom of the night; END
BEGIN NOW And now she sings. (O! singer in the gloom, END
BEGIN NOW Voicing a sorrow we can ne'er express, END
BEGIN NOW Here in the Farness where we few have room END
BEGIN NOW Unshamed to show our love and tenderness, END
BEGIN NOW Our hearts will echo, till they beat no more, END
BEGIN NOW That song of sadness and of motherland; END
BEGIN NOW And, stretched in deathless love to England's shore, END
BEGIN NOW Some day she'll hearken and she'll understand.) END
BEGIN NOW A prima-donna in the shining past, END
BEGIN NOW But now a mother growing old and gray, END
BEGIN NOW She thinks of how she held a people fast END
BEGIN NOW In thrall, and gleaned the triumphs of a day. END
BEGIN NOW She sees a sea of faces like a dream; END
BEGIN NOW She sees herself a queen of song once more; END
BEGIN NOW She sees lips part in rapture, eyes agleam; END
BEGIN NOW She sings as never once she sang before. END
BEGIN NOW She sings a wild, sweet song that throbs with pain, END
BEGIN NOW The added pain of life that transcends art -- END
BEGIN NOW A song of home, a deep, celestial strain, END
BEGIN NOW The glorious swan-song of a dying heart. END
BEGIN NOW A lame tramp comes along the railway track, END
BEGIN NOW A grizzled dog whose day is nearly done; END
BEGIN NOW He passes, pauses, then comes slowly back END
BEGIN NOW And listens there -- an audience of one. END
BEGIN NOW She sings -- her golden voice is passion-fraught, END
BEGIN NOW As when she charmed a thousand eager ears; END
BEGIN NOW He listens trembling, and she knows it not, END
BEGIN NOW And down his hollow cheeks roll bitter tears. END
BEGIN NOW She ceases and is still, as if to pray; END
BEGIN NOW There is no sound, the stars are all alight -- END
BEGIN NOW Only a wretch who stumbles on his way, END
BEGIN NOW Only a vagrant sobbing in the night. END
BEGIN NOW There's a four-pronged buck a-swinging in the shadow of my cabin, END
BEGIN NOW But I tracked it by the river, and I trailed it in the cover, END
BEGIN NOW And I killed it on the mountain miles away. END
BEGIN NOW Now I've had my lazy supper, and the level sun is gleaming END
BEGIN NOW On the water where the silver salmon play; END
BEGIN NOW And I light my little corn-cob, and I linger, softly dreaming, END
BEGIN NOW In the twilight, of a land that's far away. END
BEGIN NOW Far away, so faint and far, is flaming London, fevered Paris, END
BEGIN NOW That I fancy I have gained another star; END
BEGIN NOW Far away the din and hurry, far away the sin and worry, END
BEGIN NOW Far away -- God knows they cannot be too far. END
BEGIN NOW Had I clutched like them my chances, END
BEGIN NOW learned their wisdom, crushed my fancies, END
BEGIN NOW Starved my soul and gone to business every day. END
BEGIN NOW I can couch me deep in clover, I can listen to the story END
BEGIN NOW Of the lazy, lapping water -- it is best. END
BEGIN NOW And the robin greets the dayspring with the rapture of a lover, END
BEGIN NOW I am happy, and I'll nevermore go back. END
BEGIN NOW For I know I'd just be longing for the little old log cabin, END
BEGIN NOW With the morning-glory clinging to the door, END
BEGIN NOW Till I loathed the city places, cursed the care on all the faces, END
BEGIN NOW So send me far from Lombard Street, and write me down a failure; END
BEGIN NOW Put a little in my purse and leave me free. END
BEGIN NOW I am one of you no longer; by the trails my feet have broken, END
BEGIN NOW The dizzy peaks I've scaled, the camp-fire's glow; END
BEGIN NOW so I've sent my klooch to town, END
BEGIN NOW And I know at the dawn she'll come reeling home END
BEGIN NOW with the bottles, one, two, three -- END
BEGIN NOW One for herself, to drown her shame, and two big bottles for me, END
BEGIN NOW To make me forget the thing I am and the man I used to be. END
BEGIN NOW but they could not keep me straight; END
BEGIN NOW swift staggering through the snow. END
BEGIN NOW When a man gits on his uppers in a hard-pan sort of town, END
BEGIN NOW An' he ain't got nothin' comin' an' he can't afford ter eat, END
BEGIN NOW An' he's in a fix for lodgin' an' he wanders up an' down, END
BEGIN NOW An' you'd fancy he'd been boozin', he's so locoed 'bout the feet; END
BEGIN NOW In the little ol' log cabin in the shadder of the pines. END
BEGIN NOW When he's on the blazin' desert an' his canteen's sprung a leak, END
BEGIN NOW Then he's like ter hev' a vision, as he settles down ter die, END
BEGIN NOW Of the little ol' log cabin an' the roses an' the vines. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, the little ol' log cabin, it's a solemn shinin' mark, END
BEGIN NOW When a feller gits ter sinnin' an' a-goin' ter the wall, END
BEGIN NOW An' folks don't understand him an' he's gropin' in the dark, END
BEGIN NOW An' he's sick of bein' cursed at an' he's longin' fer his call! END
BEGIN NOW When the sun of life's a-sinkin' you can see it 'way above, END
BEGIN NOW On the hill from out the shadder in a glory 'gin the sky, END
BEGIN NOW An' never leave its shelter, an' forget, an' love, an' rest. END
BEGIN NOW If you leave the gloom of London and you seek a glowing land, END
BEGIN NOW Where all except the flag is strange and new, END
BEGIN NOW For he's your younger brother, the one you sent away END
BEGIN NOW Because there wasn't room for him at home; END
BEGIN NOW And now he's quite contented, and he's glad he didn't stay, END
BEGIN NOW And he's building Britain's greatness o'er the foam. END
BEGIN NOW When the giant herd is moving at the rising of the sun, END
BEGIN NOW And the prairie is lit with rose and gold, END
BEGIN NOW And the camp is all abustle, and the busy day's begun, END
BEGIN NOW He leaps into the saddle sure and bold. END
BEGIN NOW And when the night-winds whisper and camp-fires flicker out, END
BEGIN NOW He is sleeping like a child beneath the stars. END
BEGIN NOW When the wattle-blooms are drooping in the sombre she-oak glade, END
BEGIN NOW And the breathless land is lying in a swoon, END
BEGIN NOW And he hears the bell-bird chime the Austral noon. END
BEGIN NOW The parrakeets are silent in the gum-tree by the creek; END
BEGIN NOW The ferny grove is sunshine-steeped and still; END
BEGIN NOW But the dew will gem the myrtle in the twilight ere he seek END
BEGIN NOW His little lonely cabin on the hill. END
BEGIN NOW Around the purple, vine-clad slope the argent river dreams; END
BEGIN NOW The roses almost hide the house from view; END
BEGIN NOW A snow-peak of the Winterberg in crimson splendor gleams; END
BEGIN NOW The shadow deepens down on the karroo. END
BEGIN NOW He seeks the lily-scented dusk beneath the orange tree; END
BEGIN NOW His pipe in silence glows and fades and glows; END
BEGIN NOW And then two little maids come out and climb upon his knee, END
BEGIN NOW And one is like the lily, one the rose. END
BEGIN NOW He sees his white sheep dapple o'er the green New Zealand plain, END
BEGIN NOW And where Vancouver's shaggy ramparts frown, END
BEGIN NOW You will find him toiling, toiling, in the south or in the west, END
BEGIN NOW A child of nature, fearless, frank, and free; END
BEGIN NOW You've a brother in the army, you've another in the Church; END
BEGIN NOW One of you is a diplomatic swell; END
BEGIN NOW You've had the pick of everything and left him in the lurch, END
BEGIN NOW And yet I think he's doing very well. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sure his life is happy, and he doesn't envy yours; END
BEGIN NOW I know he loves the land his pluck has won; END
BEGIN NOW And I fancy in the years unborn, while England's fame endures, END
BEGIN NOW She will come to bless with pride -- The Younger Son. END
BEGIN NOW The cruel war was over -- oh, the triumph was so sweet! END
BEGIN NOW We watched the troops returning, through our tears; END
BEGIN NOW And everyone was shouting for the Soldiers of the Queen, END
BEGIN NOW And the glory of an age was passing by. END
BEGIN NOW And then there came a shadow, swift and sudden, dark and drear; END
BEGIN NOW The bells were silent, not an echo stirred. END
BEGIN NOW The flags were drooping sullenly, the men forgot to cheer; END
BEGIN NOW We waited, and we never spoke a word. END
BEGIN NOW The sky grew darker, darker, till from out the gloomy rack END
BEGIN NOW There came a voice that checked the heart with dread: END
BEGIN NOW Tear down, tear down your bunting now, and hang up sable black; END
BEGIN NOW They are coming -- it's the Army of the Dead. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, the clammy brow of anguish! the livid, foam-flecked lips! END
BEGIN NOW The reeling ranks of ruin swept along! END
BEGIN NOW They left us on the veldt-side, but we felt we couldn't stop END
BEGIN NOW On this, our England's crowning festal day; END
BEGIN NOW We're the men of Magersfontein, we're the men of Spion Kop, END
BEGIN NOW Colenso -- we're the men who had to pay. END
BEGIN NOW Then cheer us for our glory now, and cheer us for our pain, END
BEGIN NOW And cheer us as ye never cheered before. END
BEGIN NOW And every eye was staring at the horror of the dead, END
BEGIN NOW The pity of the men who paid the price. END
BEGIN NOW A thousand flags were flaming where the sky and city meet; END
BEGIN NOW A thousand bells were thundering the joy. END
BEGIN NOW O God, in Thy great mercy, let us nevermore forget END
BEGIN NOW The graves they left behind, the bitter graves. END
BEGIN NOW A pistol shot rings round and round the world; END
BEGIN NOW In pitiful defeat a warrior lies. END
BEGIN NOW A last defiance to dark Death is hurled, END
BEGIN NOW A last wild challenge shocks the sunlit skies. END
BEGIN NOW Alone he falls, with wide, wan, woeful eyes: END
BEGIN NOW Eyes that could smile at death -- could not face shame. END
BEGIN NOW Alone, alone he paced his narrow room, END
BEGIN NOW In the bright sunshine of that Paris day; END
BEGIN NOW Saw in his thought the awful hand of doom; END
BEGIN NOW Saw in his dream his glory pass away; END
BEGIN NOW Tried in his heart, his weary heart, to pray: END
BEGIN NOW O God! who made me, give me strength to face END
BEGIN NOW The spectre of this bitter, black disgrace. END
BEGIN NOW The burn brawls darkly down the shaggy glen; END
BEGIN NOW The bee-kissed heather blooms around the door; END
BEGIN NOW He sees himself a barefoot boy again, END
BEGIN NOW Bending o'er page of legendary lore. END
BEGIN NOW He hears the pibroch, grips the red claymore, END
BEGIN NOW Runs with the Fiery Cross, a clansman true, END
BEGIN NOW Sworn kinsman of Rob Roy and Roderick Dhu. END
BEGIN NOW Eating his heart out with a wild desire, END
BEGIN NOW One day, behind his counter trim and neat, END
BEGIN NOW He hears a sound that sets his brain afire -- END
BEGIN NOW The Highlanders are marching down the street. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, how the pipes shrill out, the mad drums beat! END
BEGIN NOW On to the gates of Hell, my Gordons gay! END
BEGIN NOW He flings his hated yardstick away. END
BEGIN NOW He sees the sullen pass, high-crowned with snow, END
BEGIN NOW Where Afghans cower with eyes of gleaming hate. END
BEGIN NOW He hurls himself against the hidden foe. END
BEGIN NOW They try to rally -- ah, too late, too late! END
BEGIN NOW Again, defenseless, with fierce eyes that wait END
BEGIN NOW For death, he stands, like baited bull at bay, END
BEGIN NOW And flouts the Boers, that mad Majuba day. END
BEGIN NOW He sees again the murderous Soudan, END
BEGIN NOW Blood-slaked and rapine-swept. He seems to stand END
BEGIN NOW Upon the gory plain of Omdurman. END
BEGIN NOW Then Magersfontein, and supreme command END
BEGIN NOW Over his Highlanders. To shake his hand END
BEGIN NOW A King is proud, and princes call him friend. END
BEGIN NOW And glory crowns his life -- and now the end, END
BEGIN NOW The awful end. His eyes are dark with doom; END
BEGIN NOW He hears the shrapnel shrieking overhead; END
BEGIN NOW He sees the ravaged ranks, the flame-stabbed gloom. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, to have fallen! -- the battle-field his bed, END
BEGIN NOW With Wauchope and his glorious brother-dead. END
BEGIN NOW Why was he saved for this, for this? And now END
BEGIN NOW He raises the revolver to his brow. END
BEGIN NOW In many a Highland home, framed with rude art, END
BEGIN NOW You'll find his portrait, rough-hewn, stern and square; END
BEGIN NOW It's graven in the Fuyam fellah's heart; END
BEGIN NOW The Ghurka reads it at his evening prayer; END
BEGIN NOW The raw lands know it, where the fierce suns glare; END
BEGIN NOW The Dervish fears it. Honor to his name END
BEGIN NOW Who holds aloft the shield of England's fame. END
BEGIN NOW Mourn for our hero, men of Northern race! END
BEGIN NOW We do not know his sin; we only know END
BEGIN NOW His sword was keen. He laughed death in the face, END
BEGIN NOW And struck, for Empire's sake, a giant blow. END
BEGIN NOW His arm was strong. Ah! well they learnt, the foe END
BEGIN NOW The echo of his deeds is ringing yet -- END
BEGIN NOW Will ring for aye. All else... let us forget. END
BEGIN NOW An angel was tired of heaven, as he lounged in the golden street; END
BEGIN NOW So the Master stooped in His pity, and gave him a pass to go, END
BEGIN NOW The sexless singers of heaven chanted a fond farewell, END
BEGIN NOW Never was seen such an angel -- eyes of heavenly blue, END
BEGIN NOW Features that shamed Apollo, hair of a golden hue; END
BEGIN NOW The women simply adored him; his lips were like Cupid's bow; END
BEGIN NOW But he never ventured to use them -- and so they voted him slow. END
BEGIN NOW Till at last there came One Woman, a marvel of loveliness, END
BEGIN NOW And she whispered to him: "Do you love me? END
BEGIN NOW And he answered that woman, Yes. END
BEGIN NOW We couldn't sit and study for the law; END
BEGIN NOW The stagnation of a bank we couldn't stand; END
BEGIN NOW For our riot blood was surging, and we didn't need much urging END
BEGIN NOW To excitements and excesses that are banned. END
BEGIN NOW So we took to wine and drink and other things, END
BEGIN NOW And the devil in us struggled to be free; END
BEGIN NOW Till our friends rose up in wrath, and they pointed out the path, END
BEGIN NOW Oh, they shook us off and shipped us o'er the foam, END
BEGIN NOW To the larger lands that lure a man to roam; END
BEGIN NOW And we took the chance they gave END
BEGIN NOW Of a far and foreign grave, END
BEGIN NOW And we bade good-by for evermore to home. END
BEGIN NOW And some of us are climbing on the peak, END
BEGIN NOW And some of us are camping on the plain; END
BEGIN NOW By pine and palm you'll find us, with never claim to bind us, END
BEGIN NOW By track and trail you'll meet us once again. END
BEGIN NOW We are the fated serfs to freedom -- sky and sea; END
BEGIN NOW We have failed where slummy cities overflow; END
BEGIN NOW But the stranger ways of earth know our pride and know our worth, END
BEGIN NOW Yes, we go into the night as brave men go, END
BEGIN NOW Though our faces they be often streaked with woe; END
BEGIN NOW Yet we're hard as cats to kill, END
BEGIN NOW And our hearts are reckless still, END
BEGIN NOW And we've danced with death a dozen times or so. END
BEGIN NOW And you'll find us in Alaska after gold, END
BEGIN NOW And you'll find us herding cattle in the South. END
BEGIN NOW We like strong drink and fun, and, when the race is run, END
BEGIN NOW We often die with curses in our mouth. END
BEGIN NOW We are wild as colts unbroke, but never mean. END
BEGIN NOW Of our sins we've shoulders broad to bear the blame; END
BEGIN NOW But we'll never stay in town and we'll never settle down, END
BEGIN NOW And we'll never have an object or an aim. END
BEGIN NOW No, there's that in us that time can never tame; END
BEGIN NOW And life will always seem a careless game; END
BEGIN NOW And they'd better far forget -- END
BEGIN NOW Those who say they love us yet -- END
BEGIN NOW Forget, blot out with bitterness our name. END
BEGIN NOW New Year's Eve END
BEGIN NOW It's cruel cold on the water-front, silent and dark and drear; END
BEGIN NOW Only the black tide weltering, only the hissing snow; END
BEGIN NOW They're playing a tune in McGuffy's saloon, END
BEGIN NOW and it's cheery and bright in there END
BEGIN NOW They'll jeer at me, and they'll sneer at me, END
BEGIN NOW and they'll call me a whiskey soak; END
BEGIN NOW McGuffy is showing a bunch of the boys how Bob Fitzsimmons hit; END
BEGIN NOW The room is reeling round and round... END
BEGIN NOW O God! but I'm tired, I'm tired.... END
BEGIN NOW Of lives that would blend like an angel-song END
BEGIN NOW in the bliss of the coming years? END
BEGIN NOW but oh, I have suffered so! END
BEGIN NOW I can hear the dreadful hum END
BEGIN NOW Of the crowded court... See! the Judge looks down... END
BEGIN NOW _NOT GUILTY_, my Lord, I swear... END
BEGIN NOW Have a drink to the glad New Year, a drop before you go -- END
BEGIN NOW You darned old dirty hobo... My God! Here, boys! He's _DEAD!_ END
BEGIN NOW Say! You've struck a heap of trouble -- END
BEGIN NOW Bust in business, lost your wife; END
BEGIN NOW No one cares a cent about you, END
BEGIN NOW You don't care a cent for life; END
BEGIN NOW Hard luck has of hope bereft you, END
BEGIN NOW Health is failing, wish you'd die -- END
BEGIN NOW Why, you've still the sunshine left you END
BEGIN NOW And the big, blue sky. END
BEGIN NOW Sky so blue it makes you wonder END
BEGIN NOW If it's heaven shining through; END
BEGIN NOW Earth so smiling 'way out yonder, END
BEGIN NOW Sun so bright it dazzles you; END
BEGIN NOW Birds a-singing, flowers a-flinging END
BEGIN NOW All their fragrance on the breeze; END
BEGIN NOW Dancing shadows, green, still meadows -- END
BEGIN NOW Don't you mope, you've still got these. END
BEGIN NOW These, and none can take them from you; END
BEGIN NOW These, and none can weigh their worth. END
BEGIN NOW What! you're tired and broke and beaten? -- END
BEGIN NOW Why, you're rich -- you've got the earth! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, if you're a tramp in tatters, END
BEGIN NOW While the blue sky bends above END
BEGIN NOW You've got nearly all that matters -- END
BEGIN NOW You've got God, and God is love. END
BEGIN NOW There was a woman, and she was wise; woefully wise was she; END
BEGIN NOW There is no hope for such as I on earth, nor yet in Heaven; END
BEGIN NOW Unloved I live, unloved I die, unpitied, unforgiven; END
BEGIN NOW A loathed jade, I ply my trade, unhallowed and unshriven. END
BEGIN NOW Until they come, the nightly scum, with drunken eyes aflame; END
BEGIN NOW For life is not the thing we thought, and not the thing we plan; END
BEGIN NOW And Woman in a bitter world must do the best she can -- END
BEGIN NOW Must serve his need and ever feed the flame of his desire, END
BEGIN NOW Though be she loved for love alone, or be she loved for hire; END
BEGIN NOW For every man since life began is tainted with the mire. END
BEGIN NOW And though you know he love you so and set you on love's throne; END
BEGIN NOW And 'tis not wise to love too well, and this all women know. END
BEGIN NOW Wherefore, the wolf-pack having gorged upon the lamb, their prey, END
BEGIN NOW With velvet paws and flensing claws, a tigress roused to slay. END
BEGIN NOW One who in youth sought truest truth and found a devil's lies; END
BEGIN NOW A symbol of the sin of man, a human sacrifice. END
BEGIN NOW Yet shall I blame on man the shame? Could it be otherwise? END
BEGIN NOW Was I not born to walk in scorn where others walk in pride? END
BEGIN NOW The Maker marred, and, evil-starred, I drift upon His tide; END
BEGIN NOW And He alone shall judge His own, so I His judgment bide. END
BEGIN NOW Fate has written a tragedy; its name is "The Human Heart". END
BEGIN NOW The Theatre is the House of Life, Woman the mummer's part; END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas a year ago and the moon was bright END
BEGIN NOW (Oh, I remember so well, so well); END
BEGIN NOW I walked with my love in a sea of light, END
BEGIN NOW And the voice of my sweet was a silver bell. END
BEGIN NOW And sudden the moon grew strangely dull, END
BEGIN NOW And sudden my love had taken wing; END
BEGIN NOW I looked on the face of a grinning skull, END
BEGIN NOW I strained to my heart a ghastly thing. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas but fantasy, for my love lay still END
BEGIN NOW In my arms, with her tender eyes aglow, END
BEGIN NOW And she wondered why my lips were chill, END
BEGIN NOW Why I was silent and kissed her so. END
BEGIN NOW A year has gone and the moon is bright, END
BEGIN NOW A gibbous moon, like a ghost of woe; END
BEGIN NOW I sit by a new-made grave to-night, END
BEGIN NOW And my heart is broken -- it's strange, you know. END
BEGIN NOW Along the road to Anywhere, when each day had its story; END
BEGIN NOW When time was yet our vassal, and life's jest was still unstale; END
BEGIN NOW Alas! the road to Anywhere is pitfalled with disaster; END
BEGIN NOW There's hunger, want, and weariness, yet O we loved it so! END
BEGIN NOW As on we tramped exultantly, and no man was our master, END
BEGIN NOW The tragic road to Anywhere, such dear, dim years ago. END

BEGIN NOW As I pondered very weary o'er a volume long and dreary -- END
BEGIN NOW Under the Shadow of Kiley's Hill END
BEGIN NOW This is the place where they all were bred; END
BEGIN NOW Born of a thoroughbred English race, END
BEGIN NOW The Swagman's Rest END
BEGIN NOW We buried old Bob where the bloodwoods wave END
BEGIN NOW The Man from Snowy River END
BEGIN NOW There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around END
BEGIN NOW All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far END
BEGIN NOW Had mustered at the homestead overnight, END
BEGIN NOW For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are, END
BEGIN NOW And the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight. END
BEGIN NOW There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup, END
BEGIN NOW The old man with his hair as white as snow; END
BEGIN NOW But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up -- END
BEGIN NOW He would go wherever horse and man could go. END
BEGIN NOW And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand, END
BEGIN NOW No better horseman ever held the reins; END
BEGIN NOW And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast, END
BEGIN NOW He was something like a racehorse undersized, END
BEGIN NOW And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye, END
BEGIN NOW And the proud and lofty carriage of his head. END
BEGIN NOW But still so slight and weedy, one would doubt his power to stay, END
BEGIN NOW For a long and tiring gallop -- lad, you'd better stop away, END
BEGIN NOW Those hills are far too rough for such as you.' END
BEGIN NOW So he waited sad and wistful -- only Clancy stood his friend -- END
BEGIN NOW 'I think we ought to let him come,' he said; END
BEGIN NOW 'I warrant he'll be with us when he's wanted at the end, END
BEGIN NOW For both his horse and he are mountain bred. END
BEGIN NOW 'He hails from Snowy River, up by Kosciusko's side, END
BEGIN NOW Where the hills are twice as steep and twice as rough, END
BEGIN NOW And the Snowy River riders on the mountains make their home, END
BEGIN NOW Where the river runs those giant hills between; END
BEGIN NOW I have seen full many horsemen since I first commenced to roam, END
BEGIN NOW But nowhere yet such horsemen have I seen.' END
BEGIN NOW So he went -- they found the horses by the big mimosa clump -- END
BEGIN NOW They raced away towards the mountain's brow, END
BEGIN NOW And the old man gave his orders, 'Boys, go at them from the jump, END
BEGIN NOW For never yet was rider that could keep the mob in sight, END
BEGIN NOW If once they gain the shelter of those hills.' END
BEGIN NOW So Clancy rode to wheel them -- he was racing on the wing END
BEGIN NOW Where the best and boldest riders take their place, END
BEGIN NOW Then they halted for a moment, while he swung the dreaded lash, END
BEGIN NOW But they saw their well-loved mountain full in view, END
BEGIN NOW Then fast the horsemen followed, where the gorges deep and black END
BEGIN NOW Resounded to the thunder of their tread, END
BEGIN NOW And upward, ever upward, the wild horses held their way, END
BEGIN NOW Where mountain ash and kurrajong grew wide; END
BEGIN NOW And the old man muttered fiercely, 'We may bid the mob good day, END
BEGIN NOW _NO_ man can hold them down the other side.' END
BEGIN NOW When they reached the mountain's summit, even Clancy took a pull, END
BEGIN NOW The wild hop scrub grew thickly, and the hidden ground was full END
BEGIN NOW Of wombat holes, and any slip was death. END
BEGIN NOW But the man from Snowy River let the pony have his head, END
BEGIN NOW And he swung his stockwhip round and gave a cheer, END
BEGIN NOW And he raced him down the mountain like a torrent down its bed, END
BEGIN NOW While the others stood and watched in very fear. END
BEGIN NOW He sent the flint stones flying, but the pony kept his feet, END
BEGIN NOW He cleared the fallen timber in his stride, END
BEGIN NOW And the man from Snowy River never shifted in his seat -- END
BEGIN NOW It was grand to see that mountain horseman ride. END
BEGIN NOW And he never drew the bridle till he landed safe and sound, END
BEGIN NOW At the bottom of that terrible descent. END
BEGIN NOW He was right among the horses as they climbed the further hill, END
BEGIN NOW And the watchers on the mountain standing mute, END
BEGIN NOW Then they lost him for a moment, where two mountain gullies met END
BEGIN NOW In the ranges, but a final glimpse reveals END
BEGIN NOW On a dim and distant hillside the wild horses racing yet, END
BEGIN NOW With the man from Snowy River at their heels. END
BEGIN NOW But his hardy mountain pony he could scarcely raise a trot, END
BEGIN NOW He was blood from hip to shoulder from the spur; END
BEGIN NOW But his pluck was still undaunted, and his courage fiery hot, END
BEGIN NOW For never yet was mountain horse a cur. END
BEGIN NOW And down by Kosciusko, where the pine-clad ridges raise END
BEGIN NOW Their torn and rugged battlements on high, END
BEGIN NOW And where around the Overflow the reedbeds sweep and sway END
BEGIN NOW To the breezes, and the rolling plains are wide, END
BEGIN NOW The man from Snowy River is a household word to-day, END
BEGIN NOW And the stockmen tell the story of his ride. END
BEGIN NOW You never heard tell of the story? END
BEGIN NOW Well, now, I can hardly believe! END
BEGIN NOW Never heard of the honour and glory END
BEGIN NOW But maybe you're only a Johnnie END
BEGIN NOW And don't know a horse from a hoe? END
BEGIN NOW Well, well, don't get angry, my sonny, END
BEGIN NOW But, really, a young un should know. END
BEGIN NOW They bred him out back on the 'Never', END
BEGIN NOW His mother was Mameluke breed. END
BEGIN NOW To the front -- and then stay there -- was ever END
BEGIN NOW The root of the Mameluke creed. END
BEGIN NOW He seemed to inherit their wiry END
BEGIN NOW Strong frames -- and their pluck to receive -- END
BEGIN NOW As hard as a flint and as fiery END
BEGIN NOW We ran him at many a meeting END
BEGIN NOW At crossing and gully and town, END
BEGIN NOW And nothing could give him a beating -- END
BEGIN NOW At least when our money was down. END
BEGIN NOW For weight wouldn't stop him, nor distance, END
BEGIN NOW Nor odds, though the others were fast, END
BEGIN NOW He'd race with a dogged persistence, END
BEGIN NOW And wear them all down at the last. END
BEGIN NOW At the Turon the Yattendon filly END
BEGIN NOW Led by lengths at the mile-and-a-half, END
BEGIN NOW And we all began to look silly, END
BEGIN NOW While _HER_ crowd were starting to laugh; END
BEGIN NOW But the old horse came faster and faster, END
BEGIN NOW His pluck told its tale, and his strength, END
BEGIN NOW He gained on her, caught her, and passed her, END
BEGIN NOW And won it, hands-down, by a length. END
BEGIN NOW And then we swooped down on Menindie END
BEGIN NOW To run for the President's Cup -- END
BEGIN NOW Oh! that's a sweet township -- a shindy END
BEGIN NOW To them is board, lodging, and sup. END
BEGIN NOW Eye-openers they are, and their system END
BEGIN NOW Is never to suffer defeat; END
BEGIN NOW It's 'win, tie, or wrangle' -- to best 'em END
BEGIN NOW You must lose 'em, or else it's 'dead heat'. END
BEGIN NOW We strolled down the township and found 'em END
BEGIN NOW At drinking and gaming and play; END
BEGIN NOW If sorrows they had, why they drowned 'em, END
BEGIN NOW And betting was soon under way. END
BEGIN NOW Their horses were good 'uns and fit 'uns, END
BEGIN NOW There was plenty of cash in the town; END
BEGIN NOW They backed their own horses like Britons, END
BEGIN NOW And, Lord! how _WE_ rattled it down! END
BEGIN NOW With gladness we thought of the morrow, END
BEGIN NOW We counted our wagers with glee, END
BEGIN NOW A simile homely to borrow -- END
BEGIN NOW 'There was plenty of milk in our tea.' END
BEGIN NOW You see we were green; and we never END
BEGIN NOW Had even a thought of foul play, END
BEGIN NOW Though we well might have known that the clever END
BEGIN NOW Division would 'put us away'. END
BEGIN NOW Experience 'docet', they tell us, END
BEGIN NOW At least so I've frequently heard, END
BEGIN NOW But, 'dosing' or 'stuffing', those fellows END
BEGIN NOW Were up to each move on the board: END
BEGIN NOW They got to his stall -- it is sinful END
BEGIN NOW To think what such villains would do -- END
BEGIN NOW And they gave him a regular skinful END
BEGIN NOW Of barley -- green barley -- to chew. END
BEGIN NOW He munched it all night, and we found him END
BEGIN NOW Next morning as full as a hog -- END
BEGIN NOW The girths wouldn't nearly meet round him; END
BEGIN NOW He looked like an overfed frog. END
BEGIN NOW We saw we were done like a dinner -- END
BEGIN NOW The odds were a thousand to one END
BEGIN NOW Against Pardon turning up winner, END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas cruel to ask him to run. END
BEGIN NOW We got to the course with our troubles, END
BEGIN NOW A crestfallen couple were we; END
BEGIN NOW And we heard the 'books' calling the doubles -- END
BEGIN NOW A roar like the surf of the sea; END
BEGIN NOW And over the tumult and louder END
BEGIN NOW Rang 'Any price Pardon, I lay!' END
BEGIN NOW Says Jimmy, 'The children of Judah END
BEGIN NOW Are out on the warpath to-day.' END
BEGIN NOW Three miles in three heats: -- Ah, my sonny, END
BEGIN NOW The horses in those days were stout, END
BEGIN NOW They had to run well to win money; END
BEGIN NOW I don't see such horses about. END
BEGIN NOW Your six-furlong vermin that scamper END
BEGIN NOW Half-a-mile with their feather-weight up; END
BEGIN NOW They wouldn't earn much of their damper END
BEGIN NOW In a race like the President's Cup. END
BEGIN NOW The first heat was soon set a-going; END
BEGIN NOW The Dancer went off to the front; END
BEGIN NOW The Don on his quarters was showing, END
BEGIN NOW With Pardon right out of the hunt. END
BEGIN NOW He rolled and he weltered and wallowed -- END
BEGIN NOW You'd kick your hat faster, I'll bet; END
BEGIN NOW They finished all bunched, and he followed END
BEGIN NOW All lathered and dripping with sweat. END
BEGIN NOW But troubles came thicker upon us, END
BEGIN NOW For while we were rubbing him dry END
BEGIN NOW The stewards came over to warn us: END
BEGIN NOW 'We hear you are running a bye! END
BEGIN NOW If Pardon don't spiel like tarnation END
BEGIN NOW And win the next heat -- if he can -- END
BEGIN NOW He'll earn a disqualification; END
BEGIN NOW Just think over _THAT_, now, my man!' END
BEGIN NOW Our money all gone and our credit, END
BEGIN NOW Our horse couldn't gallop a yard; END
BEGIN NOW And then people thought that _WE_ did it! END
BEGIN NOW It really was terribly hard. END
BEGIN NOW We were objects of mirth and derision END
BEGIN NOW To folk in the lawn and the stand, END
BEGIN NOW And the yells of the clever division END
BEGIN NOW Of 'Any price Pardon!' were grand. END
BEGIN NOW We still had a chance for the money, END
BEGIN NOW Two heats still remained to be run; END
BEGIN NOW If both fell to us -- why, my sonny, END
BEGIN NOW The clever division were done. END
BEGIN NOW And Pardon was better, we reckoned, END
BEGIN NOW His sickness was passing away, END
BEGIN NOW So he went to the post for the second END
BEGIN NOW And principal heat of the day. END
BEGIN NOW They're off and away with a rattle, END
BEGIN NOW Like dogs from the leashes let slip, END
BEGIN NOW And right at the back of the battle END
BEGIN NOW He followed them under the whip. END
BEGIN NOW They gained ten good lengths on him quickly END
BEGIN NOW He dropped right away from the pack; END
BEGIN NOW I tell you it made me feel sickly END
BEGIN NOW To see the blue jacket fall back. END
BEGIN NOW Our very last hope had departed -- END
BEGIN NOW We thought the old fellow was done, END
BEGIN NOW When all of a sudden he started END
BEGIN NOW To go like a shot from a gun. END
BEGIN NOW His chances seemed slight to embolden END
BEGIN NOW Our hearts; but, with teeth firmly set, END
BEGIN NOW We thought, 'Now or never! The old 'un END
BEGIN NOW May reckon with some of 'em yet.' END
BEGIN NOW Then loud rose the war-cry for Pardon; END
BEGIN NOW He swept like the wind down the dip, END
BEGIN NOW And over the rise by the garden, END
BEGIN NOW The jockey was done with the whip END
BEGIN NOW The field were at sixes and sevens -- END
BEGIN NOW The pace at the first had been fast -- END
BEGIN NOW And hope seemed to drop from the heavens, END
BEGIN NOW For Pardon was coming at last. END
BEGIN NOW And how he did come! It was splendid; END
BEGIN NOW He gained on them yards every bound, END
BEGIN NOW Stretching out like a greyhound extended, END
BEGIN NOW His girth laid right down on the ground. END
BEGIN NOW A shimmer of silk in the cedars END
BEGIN NOW As into the running they wheeled, END
BEGIN NOW And out flashed the whips on the leaders, END
BEGIN NOW For Pardon had collared the field. END
BEGIN NOW Then right through the ruck he came sailing -- END
BEGIN NOW I knew that the battle was won -- END
BEGIN NOW The son of Haphazard was failing, END
BEGIN NOW The Yattendon filly was done; END
BEGIN NOW He cut down the Don and the Dancer, END
BEGIN NOW He raced clean away from the mare -- END
BEGIN NOW He's in front! Catch him now if you can, sir! END
BEGIN NOW And up went my hat in the air! END
BEGIN NOW Then loud from the lawn and the garden END
BEGIN NOW Rose offers of 'Ten to one _ON!_' END
BEGIN NOW 'Who'll bet on the field? I back Pardon!' END
BEGIN NOW No use; all the money was gone. END
BEGIN NOW He came for the third heat light-hearted, END
BEGIN NOW A-jumping and dancing about; END
BEGIN NOW The others were done ere they started END
BEGIN NOW Crestfallen, and tired, and worn out. END
BEGIN NOW He won it, and ran it much faster END
BEGIN NOW Than even the first, I believe END
BEGIN NOW Oh, he was the daddy, the master, END
BEGIN NOW He showed 'em the method to travel -- END
BEGIN NOW The boy sat as still as a stone -- END
BEGIN NOW They never could see him for gravel; END
BEGIN NOW He came in hard-held, and alone. END
BEGIN NOW But he's old -- and his eyes are grown hollow; END
BEGIN NOW Like me, with my thatch of the snow; END
BEGIN NOW When he dies, then I hope I may follow, END
BEGIN NOW And go where the racehorses go. END
BEGIN NOW I don't want no harping nor singing -- END
BEGIN NOW Such things with my style don't agree; END
BEGIN NOW Where the hoofs of the horses are ringing END
BEGIN NOW There's music sufficient for me. END
BEGIN NOW And surely the thoroughbred horses END
BEGIN NOW Will rise up again and begin END
BEGIN NOW Fresh races on far-away courses, END
BEGIN NOW And p'raps they might let me slip in. END
BEGIN NOW It would look rather well the race-card on END
BEGIN NOW 'Mongst Cherubs and Seraphs and things, END
BEGIN NOW 'Angel Harrison's black gelding Pardon, END
BEGIN NOW Blue halo, white body and wings.' END
BEGIN NOW And if they have racing hereafter, END
BEGIN NOW (And who is to say they will not?) END
BEGIN NOW When the cheers and the shouting and laughter END
BEGIN NOW Proclaim that the battle grows hot; END
BEGIN NOW As they come down the racecourse a-steering, END
BEGIN NOW He'll rush to the front, I believe; END
BEGIN NOW And you'll hear the great multitude cheering END
BEGIN NOW I had written him a letter which I had, for want of better END
BEGIN NOW Knowledge, sent to where I met him down the Lachlan, years ago, END
BEGIN NOW He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the letter to him, END
BEGIN NOW Just 'on spec', addressed as follows, 'Clancy, of The Overflow'. END
BEGIN NOW And an answer came directed in a writing unexpected, END
BEGIN NOW In my wild erratic fancy visions come to me of Clancy END
BEGIN NOW Gone a-droving 'down the Cooper' where the Western drovers go; END
BEGIN NOW And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended, END
BEGIN NOW And at night the wond'rous glory of the everlasting stars. END
BEGIN NOW I am sitting in my dingy little office, where a stingy END
BEGIN NOW Ray of sunlight struggles feebly down between the houses tall, END
BEGIN NOW And the foetid air and gritty of the dusty, dirty city END
BEGIN NOW Through the open window floating, spreads its foulness over all END
BEGIN NOW And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the fiendish rattle END
BEGIN NOW Of the tramways and the 'buses making hurry down the street, END
BEGIN NOW And the language uninviting of the gutter children fighting, END
BEGIN NOW Comes fitfully and faintly through the ceaseless tramp of feet. END
BEGIN NOW And the hurrying people daunt me, and their pallid faces haunt me END
BEGIN NOW And I somehow rather fancy that I'd like to change with Clancy, END
BEGIN NOW Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons come and go, END
BEGIN NOW Conroy's Gap END
BEGIN NOW This was the way of it, don't you know -- END
BEGIN NOW Ryan was 'wanted' for stealing sheep, END
BEGIN NOW And never a trooper, high or low, END
BEGIN NOW Could find him -- catch a weasel asleep! END
BEGIN NOW Till Trooper Scott, from the Stockman's Ford -- END
BEGIN NOW A bushman, too, as I've heard them tell -- END
BEGIN NOW Chanced to find him drunk as a lord END
BEGIN NOW D'you know the place? It's a wayside inn, END
BEGIN NOW A low grog-shanty -- a bushman trap, END
BEGIN NOW Hiding away in its shame and sin END
BEGIN NOW Under the shelter of Conroy's Gap -- END
BEGIN NOW Under the shade of that frowning range, END
BEGIN NOW The roughest crowd that ever drew breath -- END
BEGIN NOW Thieves and rowdies, uncouth and strange, END
BEGIN NOW Were mustered round at the Shadow of Death. END
BEGIN NOW The trooper knew that his man would slide END
BEGIN NOW Like a dingo pup, if he saw the chance; END
BEGIN NOW And with half a start on the mountain side END
BEGIN NOW Ryan would lead him a merry dance. END
BEGIN NOW Drunk as he was when the trooper came, END
BEGIN NOW To him that did not matter a rap -- END
BEGIN NOW Drunk or sober, he was the same, END
BEGIN NOW The boldest rider in Conroy's Gap. END
BEGIN NOW 'I want you, Ryan,' the trooper said, END
BEGIN NOW 'And listen to me, if you dare resist, END
BEGIN NOW So help me heaven, I'll shoot you dead!' END
BEGIN NOW He snapped the steel on his prisoner's wrist, END
BEGIN NOW And Ryan, hearing the handcuffs click, END
BEGIN NOW Recovered his wits as they turned to go, END
BEGIN NOW For fright will sober a man as quick END
BEGIN NOW As all the drugs that the doctors know. END
BEGIN NOW There was a girl in that rough bar END
BEGIN NOW Went by the name of Kate Carew, END
BEGIN NOW Quiet and shy as the bush girls are, END
BEGIN NOW But ready-witted and plucky, too. END
BEGIN NOW She loved this Ryan, or so they say, END
BEGIN NOW And passing by, while her eyes were dim END
BEGIN NOW With tears, she said in a careless way, END
BEGIN NOW 'The Swagman's round in the stable, Jim.' END
BEGIN NOW Spoken too low for the trooper's ear, END
BEGIN NOW Why should she care if he heard or not? END
BEGIN NOW Plenty of swagmen far and near, END
BEGIN NOW And yet to Ryan it meant a lot. END
BEGIN NOW That was the name of the grandest horse END
BEGIN NOW In all the district from east to west END
BEGIN NOW In every show ring, on every course END
BEGIN NOW They always counted the Swagman best. END
BEGIN NOW He was a wonder, a raking bay -- END
BEGIN NOW One of the grand old Snowdon strain -- END
BEGIN NOW One of the sort that could race and stay END
BEGIN NOW With his mighty limbs and his length of rein. END
BEGIN NOW Born and bred on the mountain side, END
BEGIN NOW He could race through scrub like a kangaroo, END
BEGIN NOW The girl herself on his back might ride, END
BEGIN NOW And the Swagman would carry her safely through. END
BEGIN NOW He would travel gaily from daylight's flush END
BEGIN NOW Till after the stars hung out their lamps, END
BEGIN NOW There was never his like in the open bush, END
BEGIN NOW And never his match on the cattle-camps. END
BEGIN NOW For faster horses might well be found END
BEGIN NOW On racing tracks, or a plain's extent, END
BEGIN NOW But few, if any, on broken ground END
BEGIN NOW Could see the way that the Swagman went. END
BEGIN NOW When this girl's father, old Jim Carew, END
BEGIN NOW Was droving out on the Castlereagh END
BEGIN NOW With Conroy's cattle, a wire came through END
BEGIN NOW To say that his wife couldn't live the day. END
BEGIN NOW And he was a hundred miles from home, END
BEGIN NOW As flies the crow, with never a track, END
BEGIN NOW Through plains as pathless as ocean's foam, END
BEGIN NOW He mounted straight on the Swagman's back. END
BEGIN NOW He left the camp by the sundown light, END
BEGIN NOW And the settlers out on the Marthaguy END
BEGIN NOW Awoke and heard, in the dead of night, END
BEGIN NOW A single horseman hurrying by. END
BEGIN NOW He crossed the Bogan at Dandaloo, END
BEGIN NOW And many a mile of the silent plain END
BEGIN NOW That lonely rider behind him threw END
BEGIN NOW Before they settled to sleep again. END
BEGIN NOW He rode all night and he steered his course END
BEGIN NOW By the shining stars with a bushman's skill, END
BEGIN NOW And every time that he pressed his horse END
BEGIN NOW The Swagman answered him gamely still. END
BEGIN NOW He neared his home as the east was bright, END
BEGIN NOW The doctor met him outside the town: END
BEGIN NOW 'Carew! How far did you come last night?' END
BEGIN NOW 'A hundred miles since the sun went down.' END
BEGIN NOW And his wife got round, and an oath he passed, END
BEGIN NOW So long as he or one of his breed END
BEGIN NOW Could raise a coin, though it took their last END
BEGIN NOW The Swagman never should want a feed. END
BEGIN NOW And Kate Carew, when her father died, END
BEGIN NOW She kept the horse and she kept him well: END
BEGIN NOW The pride of the district far and wide, END
BEGIN NOW He lived in style at the bush hotel. END
BEGIN NOW Such was the Swagman; and Ryan knew END
BEGIN NOW Nothing about could pace the crack; END
BEGIN NOW Little he'd care for the man in blue END
BEGIN NOW If once he got on the Swagman's back. END
BEGIN NOW But how to do it? A word let fall END
BEGIN NOW Gave him the hint as the girl passed by; END
BEGIN NOW Nothing but 'Swagman -- stable-wall; END
BEGIN NOW 'Go to the stable and mind your eye.' END
BEGIN NOW He caught her meaning, and quickly turned END
BEGIN NOW To the trooper: 'Reckon you'll gain a stripe END
BEGIN NOW By arresting me, and it's easily earned; END
BEGIN NOW Let's go to the stable and get my pipe, END
BEGIN NOW The Swagman has it.' So off they went, END
BEGIN NOW And soon as ever they turned their backs END
BEGIN NOW The girl slipped down, on some errand bent END
BEGIN NOW Behind the stable, and seized an axe. END
BEGIN NOW The trooper stood at the stable door END
BEGIN NOW While Ryan went in quite cool and slow, END
BEGIN NOW And then (the trick had been played before) END
BEGIN NOW The girl outside gave the wall a blow. END
BEGIN NOW Three slabs fell out of the stable wall -- END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas done 'fore ever the trooper knew -- END
BEGIN NOW And Ryan, as soon as he saw them fall, END
BEGIN NOW Mounted the Swagman and rushed him through. END
BEGIN NOW The trooper heard the hoof-beats ring END
BEGIN NOW In the stable yard, and he slammed the gate, END
BEGIN NOW But the Swagman rose with a mighty spring END
BEGIN NOW At the fence, and the trooper fired too late, END
BEGIN NOW As they raced away and his shots flew wide END
BEGIN NOW And Ryan no longer need care a rap, END
BEGIN NOW For never a horse that was lapped in hide END
BEGIN NOW Could catch the Swagman in Conroy's Gap. END
BEGIN NOW And that's the story. You want to know END
BEGIN NOW If Ryan came back to his Kate Carew; END
BEGIN NOW Of course he should have, as stories go, END
BEGIN NOW But the worst of it is, this story's true: END
BEGIN NOW And in real life it's a certain rule, END
BEGIN NOW Whatever poets and authors say END
BEGIN NOW Of high-toned robbers and all their school, END
BEGIN NOW These horsethief fellows aren't built that way. END
BEGIN NOW Come back! Don't hope it -- the slinking hound, END
BEGIN NOW He sloped across to the Queensland side, END
BEGIN NOW And sold the Swagman for fifty pound, END
BEGIN NOW And stole the money, and more beside. END
BEGIN NOW And took to drink, and by some good chance END
BEGIN NOW Was killed -- thrown out of a stolen trap. END
BEGIN NOW And that was the end of this small romance, END
BEGIN NOW The end of the story of Conroy's Gap. END
BEGIN NOW The boys had come back from the races END
BEGIN NOW All silent and down on their luck; END
BEGIN NOW They'd backed 'em, straight out and for places, END
BEGIN NOW But never a winner they struck. END
BEGIN NOW They lost their good money on Slogan, END
BEGIN NOW And fell, most uncommonly flat, END
BEGIN NOW When Partner, the pride of the Bogan, END
BEGIN NOW Was beaten by Aristocrat. END
BEGIN NOW And one said, 'I move that instanter END
BEGIN NOW We sell out our horses and quit, END
BEGIN NOW The brutes ought to win in a canter, END
BEGIN NOW Such trials they do when they're fit. END
BEGIN NOW The last one they ran was a snorter -- END
BEGIN NOW A gallop to gladden one's heart -- END
BEGIN NOW Two-twelve for a mile and a quarter, END
BEGIN NOW And finished as straight as a dart. END
BEGIN NOW 'And then when I think that they're ready END
BEGIN NOW To win me a nice little swag, END
BEGIN NOW They are licked like the veriest neddy -- END
BEGIN NOW They're licked from the fall of the flag. END
BEGIN NOW The mare held her own to the stable, END
BEGIN NOW She died out to nothing at that, END
BEGIN NOW And Partner he never seemed able END
BEGIN NOW To pace it with Aristocrat. END
BEGIN NOW 'And times have been bad, and the seasons END
BEGIN NOW Don't promise to be of the best; END
BEGIN NOW In short, boys, there's plenty of reasons END
BEGIN NOW For giving the racing a rest. END
BEGIN NOW The mare can be kept on the station -- END
BEGIN NOW Her breeding is good as can be -- END
BEGIN NOW But Partner, his next destination END
BEGIN NOW Is rather a trouble to me. END
BEGIN NOW 'We can't sell him here, for they know him END
BEGIN NOW As well as the clerk of the course; END
BEGIN NOW He's raced and won races till, blow him, END
BEGIN NOW He's done as a handicap horse. END
BEGIN NOW A jady, uncertain performer, END
BEGIN NOW They weight him right out of the hunt, END
BEGIN NOW And clap it on warmer and warmer END
BEGIN NOW Whenever he gets near the front. END
BEGIN NOW 'It's no use to paint him or dot him END
BEGIN NOW Or put any 'fake' on his brand, END
BEGIN NOW For bushmen are smart, and they'd spot him END
BEGIN NOW In any sale-yard in the land. END
BEGIN NOW The folk about here could all tell him, END
BEGIN NOW Could swear to each separate hair; END
BEGIN NOW Let us send him to Sydney and sell him, END
BEGIN NOW There's plenty of Jugginses there. END
BEGIN NOW 'We'll call him a maiden, and treat 'em END
BEGIN NOW To trials will open their eyes, END
BEGIN NOW We'll run their best horses and beat 'em, END
BEGIN NOW And then won't they think him a prize. END
BEGIN NOW I pity the fellow that buys him, END
BEGIN NOW He'll find in a very short space, END
BEGIN NOW No matter how highly he tries him, END
BEGIN NOW The beggar won't _RACE_ in a race.' END
BEGIN NOW Next week, under 'Seller and Buyer', END
BEGIN NOW Appeared in the _DAILY GAZETTE_: END
BEGIN NOW 'A racehorse for sale, and a flyer; END
BEGIN NOW Has never been started as yet; END
BEGIN NOW A trial will show what his pace is; END
BEGIN NOW The buyer can get him in light, END
BEGIN NOW And win all the handicap races. END
BEGIN NOW Apply here before Wednesday night.' END
BEGIN NOW He sold for a hundred and thirty, END
BEGIN NOW Because of a gallop he had END
BEGIN NOW One morning with Bluefish and Bertie, END
BEGIN NOW And donkey-licked both of 'em bad. END
BEGIN NOW And when the old horse had departed, END
BEGIN NOW The life on the station grew tame; END
BEGIN NOW The race-track was dull and deserted, END
BEGIN NOW The boys had gone back on the game. END
BEGIN NOW The winter rolled by, and the station END
BEGIN NOW Was green with the garland of spring END
BEGIN NOW A spirit of glad exultation END
BEGIN NOW Awoke in each animate thing. END
BEGIN NOW And all the old love, the old longing, END
BEGIN NOW Broke out in the breasts of the boys, END
BEGIN NOW The visions of racing came thronging END
BEGIN NOW With all its delirious joys. END
BEGIN NOW The rushing of floods in their courses, END
BEGIN NOW The rattle of rain on the roofs END
BEGIN NOW Recalled the fierce rush of the horses, END
BEGIN NOW The thunder of galloping hoofs. END
BEGIN NOW And soon one broke out: 'I can suffer END
BEGIN NOW No longer the life of a slug, END
BEGIN NOW The man that don't race is a duffer, END
BEGIN NOW Let's have one more run for the mug. END
BEGIN NOW 'Why, _EVERYTHING_ races, no matter END
BEGIN NOW Whatever its method may be: END
BEGIN NOW The waterfowl hold a regatta; END
BEGIN NOW The 'possums run heats up a tree; END
BEGIN NOW The emus are constantly sprinting END
BEGIN NOW A handicap out on the plain; END
BEGIN NOW It seems like all nature was hinting, END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis time to be at it again. END
BEGIN NOW 'The cockatoo parrots are talking END
BEGIN NOW Of races to far away lands; END
BEGIN NOW The native companions are walking END
BEGIN NOW A go-as-you-please on the sands; END
BEGIN NOW The little foals gallop for pastime; END
BEGIN NOW The wallabies race down the gap; END
BEGIN NOW Let's try it once more for the last time, END
BEGIN NOW Bring out the old jacket and cap. END
BEGIN NOW 'And now for a horse; we might try one END
BEGIN NOW Of those that are bred on the place, END
BEGIN NOW But I think it better to buy one, END
BEGIN NOW A horse that has proved he can race. END
BEGIN NOW Let us send down to Sydney to Skinner, END
BEGIN NOW A thorough good judge who can ride, END
BEGIN NOW And ask him to buy us a spinner END
BEGIN NOW To clean out the whole countryside.' END
BEGIN NOW They wrote him a letter as follows: END
BEGIN NOW 'We want you to buy us a horse; END
BEGIN NOW He must have the speed to catch swallows, END
BEGIN NOW And stamina with it of course. END
BEGIN NOW The price ain't a thing that'll grieve us, END
BEGIN NOW It's getting a bad 'un annoys END
BEGIN NOW The undersigned blokes, and believe us, END
BEGIN NOW We're yours to a cinder, 'the boys'.' END
BEGIN NOW He answered: 'I've bought you a hummer, END
BEGIN NOW A horse that has never been raced; END
BEGIN NOW I saw him run over the Drummer, END
BEGIN NOW He held him outclassed and outpaced. END
BEGIN NOW His breeding's not known, but they state he END
BEGIN NOW Is born of a thoroughbred strain, END
BEGIN NOW I paid them a hundred and eighty, END
BEGIN NOW And started the horse in the train.' END
BEGIN NOW They met him -- alas, that these verses END
BEGIN NOW Aren't up to the subject's demands -- END
BEGIN NOW Can't set forth their eloquent curses, END
BEGIN NOW They went in to meet him in gladness, END
BEGIN NOW They opened his box with delight -- END
BEGIN NOW A silent procession of sadness END
BEGIN NOW They crept to the station at night. END
BEGIN NOW And life has grown dull on the station, END
BEGIN NOW The boys are all silent and slow; END
BEGIN NOW Their work is a daily vexation, END
BEGIN NOW And sport is unknown to them now. END
BEGIN NOW Whenever they think how they stranded, END
BEGIN NOW They squeal just like guinea-pigs squeal; END
BEGIN NOW They bit their own hook, and were landed END
BEGIN NOW With fifty pounds loss on the deal. END
BEGIN NOW On Western plains, where shade is not, END
BEGIN NOW 'Neath summer skies of cloudless blue, END
BEGIN NOW Where all is dry and all is hot, END
BEGIN NOW There stands the town of Dandaloo -- END
BEGIN NOW A township where life's total sum END
BEGIN NOW Is sleep, diversified with rum. END
BEGIN NOW It's grass-grown streets with dust are deep, END
BEGIN NOW 'Twere vain endeavour to express END
BEGIN NOW The dreamless silence of its sleep, END
BEGIN NOW Its wide, expansive drunkenness. END
BEGIN NOW The yearly races mostly drew END
BEGIN NOW A lively crowd to Dandaloo. END
BEGIN NOW There came a sportsman from the East, END
BEGIN NOW The eastern land where sportsmen blow, END
BEGIN NOW And brought with him a speedy beast -- END
BEGIN NOW A speedy beast as horses go. END
BEGIN NOW He came afar in hope to 'do' END
BEGIN NOW The little town of Dandaloo. END
BEGIN NOW Now this was weak of him, I wot -- END
BEGIN NOW Exceeding weak, it seemed to me -- END
BEGIN NOW For we in Dandaloo were not END
BEGIN NOW The Jugginses we seemed to be; END
BEGIN NOW In fact, we rather thought we knew END
BEGIN NOW Our book by heart in Dandaloo. END
BEGIN NOW We held a meeting at the bar, END
BEGIN NOW And met the question fair and square -- END
BEGIN NOW 'We've stumped the country near and far END
BEGIN NOW To raise the cash for races here; END
BEGIN NOW We've got a hundred pounds or two -- END
BEGIN NOW Not half so bad for Dandaloo. END
BEGIN NOW 'And now, it seems, we have to be END
BEGIN NOW Cleaned out by this here Sydney bloke, END
BEGIN NOW With his imported horse; and he END
BEGIN NOW Will scoop the pool and leave us broke END
BEGIN NOW Shall we sit still, and make no fuss END
BEGIN NOW While this chap climbs all over us?' END
BEGIN NOW The races came to Dandaloo, END
BEGIN NOW And all the cornstalks from the West, END
BEGIN NOW On ev'ry kind of moke and screw, END
BEGIN NOW Came forth in all their glory drest. END
BEGIN NOW The stranger's horse, as hard as nails, END
BEGIN NOW Look'd fit to run for New South Wales. END
BEGIN NOW He won the race by half a length -- END
BEGIN NOW _QUITE_ half a length, it seemed to me -- END
BEGIN NOW But Dandaloo, with all its strength, END
BEGIN NOW Roared out 'Dead heat!' most fervently; END
BEGIN NOW And, after hesitation meet, END
BEGIN NOW The judge's verdict was 'Dead heat!' END
BEGIN NOW And many men there were could tell END
BEGIN NOW What gave the verdict extra force: END
BEGIN NOW The stewards, and the judge as well -- END
BEGIN NOW They all had backed the second horse. END
BEGIN NOW For things like this they sometimes do END
BEGIN NOW In larger towns than Dandaloo. END
BEGIN NOW They ran it off; the stranger won, END
BEGIN NOW Hands down, by near a hundred yards END
BEGIN NOW He smiled to think his troubles done; END
BEGIN NOW But Dandaloo held all the cards. END
BEGIN NOW They went to scale and -- cruel fate! -- END
BEGIN NOW His jockey turned out under-weight. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps they'd tampered with the scale! END
BEGIN NOW I cannot tell. I only know END
BEGIN NOW It weighed him _OUT_ all right. I fail END
BEGIN NOW To paint that Sydney sportsman's woe. END
BEGIN NOW He said the stewards were a crew END
BEGIN NOW Of low-lived thieves in Dandaloo. END
BEGIN NOW He lifted up his voice, irate, END
BEGIN NOW And swore till all the air was blue; END
BEGIN NOW So then we rose to vindicate END
BEGIN NOW The dignity of Dandaloo. END
BEGIN NOW 'Look here,' said we, 'you must not poke END
BEGIN NOW Such oaths at us poor country folk.' END
BEGIN NOW We rode him softly on a rail, END
BEGIN NOW We shied at him, in careless glee, END
BEGIN NOW Some large tomatoes, rank and stale, END
BEGIN NOW And eggs of great antiquity -- END
BEGIN NOW Their wild, unholy fragrance flew END
BEGIN NOW About the town of Dandaloo. END
BEGIN NOW He left the town at break of day, END
BEGIN NOW He led his race-horse through the streets, END
BEGIN NOW And now he tells the tale, they say, END
BEGIN NOW To every racing man he meets. END
BEGIN NOW And Sydney sportsmen all eschew END
BEGIN NOW The atmosphere of Dandaloo. END
BEGIN NOW It was somewhere up the country, in a land of rock and scrub, END
BEGIN NOW That they formed an institution called the Geebung Polo Club. END
BEGIN NOW They were long and wiry natives from the rugged mountain side, END
BEGIN NOW And the horse was never saddled that the Geebungs couldn't ride; END
BEGIN NOW But their style of playing polo was irregular and rash -- END
BEGIN NOW They had mighty little science, but a mighty lot of dash: END
BEGIN NOW And they played on mountain ponies that were muscular and strong, END
BEGIN NOW and their manes and tails were long. END
BEGIN NOW And they used to train those ponies wheeling cattle in the scrub: END
BEGIN NOW It was somewhere down the country, in a city's smoke and steam, END
BEGIN NOW That a polo club existed, called 'The Cuff and Collar Team'. END
BEGIN NOW As a social institution 'twas a marvellous success, END
BEGIN NOW For the members were distinguished by exclusiveness and dress. END
BEGIN NOW So they started up the country in pursuit of sport and fame, END
BEGIN NOW Now my readers can imagine how the contest ebbed and flowed, END
BEGIN NOW When the Geebung boys got going it was time to clear the road; END
BEGIN NOW And the game was so terrific that ere half the time was gone END
BEGIN NOW A spectator's leg was broken -- just from merely looking on. END
BEGIN NOW For they waddied one another till the plain was strewn with dead, END
BEGIN NOW And the Cuff and Collar Captain, when he tumbled off to die, END
BEGIN NOW Was the last surviving player -- so the game was called a tie. END
BEGIN NOW So he scrambled on his pony for his last expiring chance, END
BEGIN NOW For he meant to make an effort to get victory to his side; END
BEGIN NOW By the old Campaspe River, where the breezes shake the grass, END
BEGIN NOW There's a row of little gravestones that the stockmen never pass, END
BEGIN NOW And on misty moonlit evenings, while the dingoes howl around, END
BEGIN NOW You can see their shadows flitting down that phantom polo ground; END
BEGIN NOW And the rattle of the mallets, and the rush of ponies' feet, END
BEGIN NOW Till the terrified spectator rides like blazes to the pub -- END
BEGIN NOW He's been haunted by the spectres of the Geebung Polo Club. END
BEGIN NOW The roving breezes come and go, the reed beds sweep and sway, END
BEGIN NOW The sleepy river murmurs low, and loiters on its way, END
BEGIN NOW It is the land of lots o' time along the Castlereagh. END
BEGIN NOW The old man's son had left the farm, he found it dull and slow, END
BEGIN NOW He drifted to the great North-west where all the rovers go. END
BEGIN NOW He's shearing here and fencing there, a kind of waif and stray, END
BEGIN NOW He's droving now with Conroy's sheep along the Castlereagh. END
BEGIN NOW Or tramping down the black soil flats across by Waddiwong, END
BEGIN NOW But all those little country towns would send the letter wrong, END
BEGIN NOW The mailman, if he's extra tired, would pass them in his sleep, END
BEGIN NOW It's safest to address the note to 'Care of Conroy's sheep', END
BEGIN NOW For five and twenty thousand head can scarcely go astray, END
BEGIN NOW You write to 'Care of Conroy's sheep along the Castlereagh'.' END
BEGIN NOW By rock and ridge and riverside the western mail has gone, END
BEGIN NOW Across the great Blue Mountain Range to take that letter on. END
BEGIN NOW A moment on the topmost grade while open fire doors glare, END
BEGIN NOW She pauses like a living thing to breathe the mountain air, END
BEGIN NOW Then launches down the other side across the plains away END
BEGIN NOW To bear that note to 'Conroy's sheep along the Castlereagh'. END
BEGIN NOW And now by coach and mailman's bag it goes from town to town, END
BEGIN NOW A speck upon the waste of plain the lonely mailman rides. END
BEGIN NOW Where fierce hot winds have set the pine and myall boughs asweep END
BEGIN NOW He hails the shearers passing by for news of Conroy's sheep. END
BEGIN NOW By big lagoons where wildfowl play and crested pigeons flock, END
BEGIN NOW By camp fires where the drovers ride around their restless stock, END
BEGIN NOW My letter chases Conroy's sheep along the Castlereagh. END
BEGIN NOW Now this is the law of the Overland that all in the West obey, END
BEGIN NOW A man must cover with travelling sheep a six-mile stage a day; END
BEGIN NOW but they camp where the grass is good; END
BEGIN NOW on the edge of the saltbush plains, END
BEGIN NOW 'tis written in white and black -- END
BEGIN NOW on the runs where the grass is dead, END
BEGIN NOW But they spread their sheep on a well-grassed run END
BEGIN NOW till they go with a two-mile spread. END
BEGIN NOW are willing the peace to keep, END
BEGIN NOW For the drovers learn how to use their hands END
BEGIN NOW when they go with the travelling sheep; END
BEGIN NOW Now Saltbush Bill was a drover tough, as ever the country knew, END
BEGIN NOW He had fought his way on the Great Stock Routes END
BEGIN NOW from the sea to the big Barcoo; END
BEGIN NOW He could tell when he came to a friendly run END
BEGIN NOW that gave him a chance to spread, END
BEGIN NOW with a mob that could scarcely creep, END
BEGIN NOW (When the kangaroos by the thousands starve, END
BEGIN NOW it is rough on the travelling sheep), END
BEGIN NOW 'or the half of the mob are done!' END
BEGIN NOW And they set to work on the straggling sheep, END
BEGIN NOW and with many a stockwhip crack END
BEGIN NOW They forced them in where the grass was dead END
BEGIN NOW in the space of the half-mile track; END
BEGIN NOW in the teeth of that Jackaroo. END
BEGIN NOW though the sheep ran loose the while, END
BEGIN NOW Now, the new chum fought for his honour's sake END
BEGIN NOW and the pride of the English race, END
BEGIN NOW they whispered to Saltbush Bill -- END
BEGIN NOW 'We have spread the sheep with a two-mile spread, END
BEGIN NOW and the grass it is something grand, END
BEGIN NOW You must stick to him, Bill, for another round END
BEGIN NOW for the pride of the Overland.' END
BEGIN NOW and glared on the brick-red loam, END
BEGIN NOW So the new chum rode to the homestead straight END
BEGIN NOW and he told them a story grand END
BEGIN NOW Of the desperate fight that he fought that day END
BEGIN NOW with the King of the Overland. END
BEGIN NOW And the tale went home to the Public Schools END
BEGIN NOW of the pluck of the English swell, END
BEGIN NOW were boxed on the Old Man Plain. END
BEGIN NOW with a curse and a stockwhip crack, END
BEGIN NOW They hunted them off on the road once more END
BEGIN NOW to starve on the half-mile track. END
BEGIN NOW And Saltbush Bill, on the Overland, will many a time recite END
BEGIN NOW How the best day's work that ever he did END
BEGIN NOW was the day that he lost the fight. END
BEGIN NOW I bought a run a while ago, END
BEGIN NOW On country rough and ridgy, END
BEGIN NOW Where wallaroos and wombats grow -- END
BEGIN NOW The grass is rather scant, it's true, END
BEGIN NOW But this a fair exchange is, END
BEGIN NOW The sheep can see a lovely view END
BEGIN NOW By climbing up the ranges. END
BEGIN NOW And She-oak Flat's the station's name, END
BEGIN NOW I'm not surprised at that, sirs: END
BEGIN NOW The oaks were there before I came, END
BEGIN NOW And I supplied the flat, sirs. END
BEGIN NOW A man would wonder how it's done, END
BEGIN NOW The stock so soon decreases -- END
BEGIN NOW They sometimes tumble off the run END
BEGIN NOW And break themselves to pieces. END
BEGIN NOW I've tried to make expenses meet, END
BEGIN NOW But wasted all my labours, END
BEGIN NOW The sheep the dingoes didn't eat END
BEGIN NOW Were stolen by the neighbours. END
BEGIN NOW They stole my pears -- my native pears -- END
BEGIN NOW Those thrice-convicted felons, END
BEGIN NOW And ravished from me unawares END
BEGIN NOW My crop of paddy-melons. END
BEGIN NOW And sometimes under sunny skies, END
BEGIN NOW Without an explanation, END
BEGIN NOW The Murrumbidgee used to rise END
BEGIN NOW And overflow the station. END
BEGIN NOW But this was caused (as now I know) END
BEGIN NOW When summer sunshine glowing END
BEGIN NOW Had melted all Kiandra's snow END
BEGIN NOW And set the river going. END
BEGIN NOW And in the news, perhaps you read: END
BEGIN NOW 'Stock passings. Puckawidgee, END
BEGIN NOW Fat cattle: Seven hundred head END
BEGIN NOW Swept down the Murrumbidgee; END
BEGIN NOW Their destination's quite obscure, END
BEGIN NOW But, somehow, there's a notion, END
BEGIN NOW Unless the river falls, they're sure END
BEGIN NOW To reach the Southern Ocean.' END
BEGIN NOW So after that I'll give it best; END
BEGIN NOW No more with Fate I'll battle. END
BEGIN NOW I'll let the river take the rest, END
BEGIN NOW For those were all my cattle. END
BEGIN NOW And with one comprehensive curse END
BEGIN NOW I close my brief narration, END
BEGIN NOW And advertise it in my verse -- END
BEGIN NOW There came a stranger to Walgett town, END
BEGIN NOW To Walgett town when the sun was low, END
BEGIN NOW And he carried a thirst that was worth a crown, END
BEGIN NOW Yet how to quench it he did not know; END
BEGIN NOW But he thought he might take those yokels down, END
BEGIN NOW The guileless yokels of Walgett town. END
BEGIN NOW They made him a bet in a private bar, END
BEGIN NOW In a private bar when the talk was high, END
BEGIN NOW And they bet him some pounds no matter how far END
BEGIN NOW He could pelt a stone, yet he could not shy END
BEGIN NOW A stone right over the river so brown, END
BEGIN NOW The Darling river at Walgett town. END
BEGIN NOW He knew that the river from bank to bank END
BEGIN NOW Was fifty yards, and he smiled a smile END
BEGIN NOW As he trundled down, but his hopes they sank END
BEGIN NOW For there wasn't a stone within fifty mile; END
BEGIN NOW For the saltbush plain and the open down END
BEGIN NOW Produce no quarries in Walgett town. END
BEGIN NOW The yokels laughed at his hopes o'erthrown, END
BEGIN NOW And he stood awhile like a man in a dream; END
BEGIN NOW Then out of his pocket he fetched a stone, END
BEGIN NOW And pelted it over the silent stream -- END
BEGIN NOW He had been there before: he had wandered down END
BEGIN NOW On a previous visit to Walgett town. END
BEGIN NOW The widow sought the lawyer's room with children three in tow, END
BEGIN NOW She told the lawyer man her tale in tones of deepest woe. END
BEGIN NOW Said she, 'My husband took to drink for pains in his inside, END
BEGIN NOW And never drew a sober breath from then until he died. END
BEGIN NOW 'He never drew a sober breath, he died without a will, END
BEGIN NOW And I must sell the bit of land the childer's mouths to fill. END
BEGIN NOW There's some is grown and gone away, but some is childer yet, END
BEGIN NOW And times is very bad indeed -- a livin's hard to get. END
BEGIN NOW And Fred is drovin' Conroy's sheep along the Castlereagh, END
BEGIN NOW And Charley's shearin' down the Bland, and Peter is away.' END
BEGIN NOW The lawyer wrote the details down in ink of legal blue -- END
BEGIN NOW 'There's Minnie, Susan, Christopher, they stop at home with you; END
BEGIN NOW There's Sarah, Frederick, and Charles, I'll write to them to-day, END
BEGIN NOW 'You'll have to furnish his consent to sell the bit of land.' END
BEGIN NOW The widow shuffled in her seat, 'Oh, don't you understand? END
BEGIN NOW I thought a lawyer ought to know -- I don't know what to say -- END
BEGIN NOW You'll have to do without him, boss, for Peter is away.' END
BEGIN NOW The mystery of Peter's life -- the man who was away. END
BEGIN NOW The Man from Ironbark END
BEGIN NOW It was the man from Ironbark who struck the Sydney town, END
BEGIN NOW He wandered over street and park, he wandered up and down. END
BEGIN NOW He loitered here, he loitered there, till he was like to drop, END
BEGIN NOW Until at last in sheer despair he sought a barber's shop. END
BEGIN NOW ''Ere! shave my beard and whiskers off, I'll be a man of mark, END
BEGIN NOW I'll go and do the Sydney toff up home in Ironbark.' END
BEGIN NOW The barber man was small and flash, as barbers mostly are, END
BEGIN NOW He wore a strike-your-fancy sash, he smoked a huge cigar: END
BEGIN NOW He was a humorist of note and keen at repartee, END
BEGIN NOW He laid the odds and kept a 'tote', whatever that may be, END
BEGIN NOW And when he saw our friend arrive, he whispered 'Here's a lark! END
BEGIN NOW Just watch me catch him all alive, this man from Ironbark.' END
BEGIN NOW There were some gilded youths that sat along the barber's wall, END
BEGIN NOW 'I'll make this bloomin' yokel think his bloomin' throat is cut.' END
BEGIN NOW 'I s'pose the flats is pretty green up there in Ironbark.' END
BEGIN NOW A grunt was all reply he got; he shaved the bushman's chin, END
BEGIN NOW Then made the water boiling hot and dipped the razor in. END
BEGIN NOW Upon the newly shaven skin it made a livid mark -- END
BEGIN NOW No doubt it fairly took him in -- the man from Ironbark. END
BEGIN NOW He fetched a wild up-country yell might wake the dead to hear, END
BEGIN NOW 'You've done for me! you dog, I'm beat! one hit before I go! END
BEGIN NOW I only wish I had a knife, you blessed murdering shark! END
BEGIN NOW But you'll remember all your life, the man from Ironbark.' END
BEGIN NOW He lifted up his hairy paw, with one tremendous clout END
BEGIN NOW He landed on the barber's jaw, and knocked the barber out. END
BEGIN NOW He set to work with tooth and nail, he made the place a wreck; END
BEGIN NOW He grabbed the nearest gilded youth, and tried to break his neck. END
BEGIN NOW And 'Murder! Bloody Murder!' yelled the man from Ironbark. END
BEGIN NOW A peeler man who heard the din came in to see the show; END
BEGIN NOW He tried to run the bushman in, but he refused to go. END
BEGIN NOW And when at last the barber spoke, and said, ''Twas all in fun -- END
BEGIN NOW 'Them barber chaps what keeps a tote, By George, I've had enough, END
BEGIN NOW That flowing beards are all the go way up in Ironbark. END
BEGIN NOW I had ridden over hurdles up the country once or twice, END
BEGIN NOW By the side of Snowy River with a horse they called 'The Ace'. END
BEGIN NOW And we brought him down to Sydney, and our rider Jimmy Rice, END
BEGIN NOW 'Are you ready?' said the starter, as we held the horses back, END
BEGIN NOW All ablazing with impatience, with excitement all aglow; END
BEGIN NOW Before us like a ribbon stretched the steeplechasing track, END
BEGIN NOW And the sun-rays glistened brightly on the chestnut and the black END
BEGIN NOW Well, I scarcely knew we'd started, I was stupid-like with wonder END
BEGIN NOW And we flew it like a hurdle, not a baulk and not a blunder, END
BEGIN NOW As we charged it all together, and it fairly whistled under, END
BEGIN NOW And then some were pulled behind me and a few shot out and led. END
BEGIN NOW So we ran for half the distance, and I'm making no pretences END
BEGIN NOW When I tell you I was feeling very nervous-like and queer, END
BEGIN NOW For those jockeys rode like demons; END
BEGIN NOW you would think they'd lost their senses END
BEGIN NOW Are there riders on Monaro? ----' but I never heard the rest. END
BEGIN NOW Let us mend the pace a little and we'll see who cries a crack.' END
BEGIN NOW So we raced away together, and we left the others standing, END
BEGIN NOW And the people cheered and shouted as we settled down to ride, END
BEGIN NOW And we clung beside the Quiver. At his taking off and landing END
BEGIN NOW I could see his scarlet nostril and his mighty ribs expanding, END
BEGIN NOW There was no one next or near me for the field was fairly slated, END
BEGIN NOW And he shook my hand and told me that in all his days he never END
BEGIN NOW Met a man who rode more gamely, and our last set to was prime, END
BEGIN NOW And we wired them on Monaro how we chanced to beat the Quiver. END
BEGIN NOW And they sent us back an answer, 'Good old sort from Snowy River: END
BEGIN NOW _HIM_ going to ride for us! _HIM_ -- END
BEGIN NOW with the pants and the eyeglass and all. END
BEGIN NOW Amateur! don't he just look it -- it's twenty to one on a fall. END
BEGIN NOW Ride! Don't tell _ME_ he can ride. END
BEGIN NOW With his pants just as loose as balloons, END
BEGIN NOW you mind that he don't clout you off -- END
BEGIN NOW and the splinters fly up from the rail. END
BEGIN NOW All you can do is to hold him and just let him jump as he likes, END
BEGIN NOW Fell at that wall once, he did, and it gave him a regular spread, END
BEGIN NOW he'll take first-class care he don't fall, END
BEGIN NOW And I think that's the lot -- but remember, END
BEGIN NOW Well, he's down safe as far as the start, END
BEGIN NOW and he seems to sit on pretty neat, END
BEGIN NOW Only his baggified breeches would ruinate anyone's seat -- END
BEGIN NOW They're away -- here they come -- the first fence, END
BEGIN NOW and he's head over heels for a crown! END
BEGIN NOW Good for the new chum, he's over, and two of the others are down! END
BEGIN NOW Now for the treble, my hearty -- By Jove, he can ride, after all; END
BEGIN NOW He hasn't much fear of a fall. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, good, that's the style -- come away! END
BEGIN NOW Rataplan's certain to beat you, unless you can give him the slip; END
BEGIN NOW Battleaxe, Battleaxe, yet -- and it's Battleaxe wins for a crown; END
BEGIN NOW Well, sir, you rode him just perfect -- END
BEGIN NOW I knew from the first you could ride. END
BEGIN NOW and them was the words that I said. END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run END
BEGIN NOW The roving breezes come and go END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run, END
BEGIN NOW The sleepy river murmurs low, END
BEGIN NOW And far away one dimly sees END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the stretch of forest trees -- END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the foothills dusk and dun -- END
BEGIN NOW The ranges sleeping in the sun END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis many years since first I came END
BEGIN NOW To Kiley's Run, END
BEGIN NOW More years than I would care to name END
BEGIN NOW Since I, a stripling, used to ride END
BEGIN NOW For miles and miles at Kiley's side, END
BEGIN NOW The while in stirring tones he told END
BEGIN NOW The stories of the days of old END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW I see the old bush homestead now END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run, END
BEGIN NOW Just nestled down beneath the brow END
BEGIN NOW Of one small ridge above the sweep END
BEGIN NOW Of river-flat, where willows weep END
BEGIN NOW And jasmine flowers and roses bloom, END
BEGIN NOW The air was laden with perfume END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW We lived the good old station life END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run, END
BEGIN NOW With little thought of care or strife. END
BEGIN NOW Old Kiley seldom used to roam, END
BEGIN NOW He liked to make the Run his home, END
BEGIN NOW The swagman never turned away END
BEGIN NOW With empty hand at close of day END
BEGIN NOW From Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW We kept a racehorse now and then END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run, END
BEGIN NOW And neighb'ring stations brought their men END
BEGIN NOW To meetings where the sport was free, END
BEGIN NOW And dainty ladies came to see END
BEGIN NOW Their champions ride; with laugh and song END
BEGIN NOW The old house rang the whole night long END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW The station hands were friends I wot END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run, END
BEGIN NOW A reckless, merry-hearted lot -- END
BEGIN NOW All splendid riders, and they knew END
BEGIN NOW The 'boss' was kindness through and through. END
BEGIN NOW Old Kiley always stood their friend, END
BEGIN NOW And so they served him to the end END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW But droughts and losses came apace END
BEGIN NOW To Kiley's Run, END
BEGIN NOW Till ruin stared him in the face; END
BEGIN NOW He toiled and toiled while lived the light, END
BEGIN NOW He dreamed of overdrafts at night: END
BEGIN NOW At length, because he could not pay, END
BEGIN NOW His bankers took the stock away END
BEGIN NOW From Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW Old Kiley stood and saw them go END
BEGIN NOW From Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW The well-bred cattle marching slow; END
BEGIN NOW His stockmen, mates for many a day, END
BEGIN NOW They wrung his hand and went away. END
BEGIN NOW Too old to make another start, END
BEGIN NOW Old Kiley died -- of broken heart, END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW The owner lives in England now END
BEGIN NOW Of Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW He knows a racehorse from a cow; END
BEGIN NOW But that is all he knows of stock: END
BEGIN NOW His chiefest care is how to dock END
BEGIN NOW Expenses, and he sends from town END
BEGIN NOW To cut the shearers' wages down END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW There are no neighbours anywhere END
BEGIN NOW Near Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW The hospitable homes are bare, END
BEGIN NOW The gardens gone; for no pretence END
BEGIN NOW Must hinder cutting down expense: END
BEGIN NOW The homestead that we held so dear END
BEGIN NOW Contains a half-paid overseer END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW All life and sport and hope have died END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW No longer there the stockmen ride; END
BEGIN NOW For sour-faced boundary riders creep END
BEGIN NOW On mongrel horses after sheep, END
BEGIN NOW Through ranges where, at racing speed, END
BEGIN NOW Old Kiley used to 'wheel the lead' END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW There runs a lane for thirty miles END
BEGIN NOW Through Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW On either side the herbage smiles, END
BEGIN NOW But wretched trav'lling sheep must pass END
BEGIN NOW Without a drink or blade of grass END
BEGIN NOW Thro' that long lane of death and shame: END
BEGIN NOW The weary drovers curse the name END
BEGIN NOW Of Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW The name itself is changed of late END
BEGIN NOW Of Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW They call it 'Chandos Park Estate'. END
BEGIN NOW The lonely swagman through the dark END
BEGIN NOW Must hump his swag past Chandos Park. END
BEGIN NOW The name is English, don't you see, END
BEGIN NOW The old name sweeter sounds to me END
BEGIN NOW Of 'Kiley's Run'. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot guess what fate will bring END
BEGIN NOW To Kiley's Run -- END
BEGIN NOW For chances come and changes ring -- END
BEGIN NOW I scarcely think 'twill always be END
BEGIN NOW Locked up to suit an absentee; END
BEGIN NOW And if he lets it out in farms END
BEGIN NOW His tenants soon will carry arms END
BEGIN NOW On Kiley's Run. END
BEGIN NOW Frying Pan's Theology END
BEGIN NOW Shock-headed blackfellow, END
BEGIN NOW Boy (on a pony). END
BEGIN NOW Snowflakes are falling END
BEGIN NOW So gentle and slow, END
BEGIN NOW Youngster says, 'Frying Pan, END
BEGIN NOW What makes it snow?' END
BEGIN NOW Frying Pan confident END
BEGIN NOW Makes the reply -- END
BEGIN NOW 'Shake 'em big flour bag END
BEGIN NOW Up in the sky!' END
BEGIN NOW 'What! when there's miles of it! END
BEGIN NOW Sur'ly that's brag. END
BEGIN NOW Who is there strong enough END
BEGIN NOW Shake such a bag?' END
BEGIN NOW 'What parson tellin' you, END
BEGIN NOW Tell you in Sunday-school? END
BEGIN NOW Big feller God! END
BEGIN NOW He drive His bullock dray, END
BEGIN NOW Then thunder go, END
BEGIN NOW He shake His flour bag -- END
BEGIN NOW Tumble down snow!' END
BEGIN NOW It was shearing-time at the Myall Lake, END
BEGIN NOW And there rose the sound thro' the livelong day END
BEGIN NOW Of the constant clash that the shear-blades make END
BEGIN NOW When the fastest shearers are making play, END
BEGIN NOW But there wasn't a man in the shearers' lines END
BEGIN NOW That could shear a sheep with the two Devines. END
BEGIN NOW They had rung the sheds of the east and west, END
BEGIN NOW Had beaten the cracks of the Walgett side, END
BEGIN NOW And the Cooma shearers had giv'n them best -- END
BEGIN NOW When they saw them shear, they were satisfied. END
BEGIN NOW From the southern slopes to the western pines END
BEGIN NOW They were noted men, were the two Devines. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas a wether flock that had come to hand, END
BEGIN NOW Great struggling brutes, that the shearers shirk, END
BEGIN NOW For the fleece was filled with the grass and sand, END
BEGIN NOW And seventy sheep was a big day's work. END
BEGIN NOW 'At a pound a hundred it's dashed hard lines END
BEGIN NOW To shear such sheep,' said the two Devines. END
BEGIN NOW But the shearers knew that they'd make a cheque END
BEGIN NOW When they came to deal with the station ewes; END
BEGIN NOW They were bare of belly and bare of neck END
BEGIN NOW With a fleece as light as a kangaroo's. END
BEGIN NOW 'We will show the boss how a shear-blade shines END
BEGIN NOW When we reach those ewes,' said the two Devines. END
BEGIN NOW But it chanced next day when the stunted pines END
BEGIN NOW Were swayed and stirred with the dawn-wind's breath, END
BEGIN NOW That a message came for the two Devines END
BEGIN NOW That their father lay at the point of death. END
BEGIN NOW So away at speed through the whispering pines END
BEGIN NOW Down the bridle track rode the two Devines. END
BEGIN NOW It was fifty miles to their father's hut, END
BEGIN NOW And the dawn was bright when they rode away; END
BEGIN NOW At the fall of night when the shed was shut END
BEGIN NOW And the men had rest from the toilsome day, END
BEGIN NOW To the shed once more through the dark'ning pines END
BEGIN NOW On their weary steeds came the two Devines. END
BEGIN NOW 'Well, you're back right sudden,' the super. said; END
BEGIN NOW 'Is the old man dead and the funeral done?' END
BEGIN NOW 'Well, no, sir, he ain't not exactly dead, END
BEGIN NOW But as good as dead,' said the eldest son -- END
BEGIN NOW 'And we couldn't bear such a chance to lose, END
BEGIN NOW So we came straight back to tackle the ewes.' END
BEGIN NOW They are shearing ewes at the Myall Lake, END
BEGIN NOW And the shed is merry the livelong day END
BEGIN NOW With the clashing sound that the shear-blades make END
BEGIN NOW When the fastest shearers are making play, END
BEGIN NOW And a couple of 'hundred and ninety-nines' END
BEGIN NOW Are the tallies made by the two Devines. END
BEGIN NOW 'Only a pound,' said the auctioneer, END
BEGIN NOW 'Only a pound; and I'm standing here END
BEGIN NOW Selling this animal, gain or loss. END
BEGIN NOW Only a pound for the drover's horse; END
BEGIN NOW One of the sort that was never afraid, END
BEGIN NOW One of the boys of the Old Brigade; END
BEGIN NOW Thoroughly honest and game, I'll swear, END
BEGIN NOW Only a little the worse for wear; END
BEGIN NOW Plenty as bad to be seen in town, END
BEGIN NOW Give me a bid and I'll knock him down; END
BEGIN NOW Sold as he stands, and without recourse, END
BEGIN NOW Give me a bid for the drover's horse.' END
BEGIN NOW Loitering there in an aimless way END
BEGIN NOW Somehow I noticed the poor old grey, END
BEGIN NOW Weary and battered and screwed, of course, END
BEGIN NOW Yet when I noticed the old grey horse, END
BEGIN NOW The rough bush saddle, and single rein END
BEGIN NOW Of the bridle laid on his tangled mane, END
BEGIN NOW Straightway the crowd and the auctioneer END
BEGIN NOW Seemed on a sudden to disappear, END
BEGIN NOW Melted away in a kind of haze, END
BEGIN NOW For my heart went back to the droving days. END
BEGIN NOW Back to the road, and I crossed again END
BEGIN NOW Over the miles of the saltbush plain -- END
BEGIN NOW The shining plain that is said to be END
BEGIN NOW The dried-up bed of an inland sea, END
BEGIN NOW Where the air so dry and so clear and bright END
BEGIN NOW Refracts the sun with a wondrous light, END
BEGIN NOW And out in the dim horizon makes END
BEGIN NOW The deep blue gleam of the phantom lakes. END
BEGIN NOW At dawn of day we would feel the breeze END
BEGIN NOW That stirred the boughs of the sleeping trees, END
BEGIN NOW And brought a breath of the fragrance rare END
BEGIN NOW That comes and goes in that scented air; END
BEGIN NOW For the trees and grass and the shrubs contain END
BEGIN NOW A dry sweet scent on the saltbush plain. END
BEGIN NOW For those that love it and understand, END
BEGIN NOW The saltbush plain is a wonderland. END
BEGIN NOW A wondrous country, where Nature's ways END
BEGIN NOW Were revealed to me in the droving days. END
BEGIN NOW We saw the fleet wild horses pass, END
BEGIN NOW And the kangaroos through the Mitchell grass, END
BEGIN NOW The emu ran with her frightened brood END
BEGIN NOW All unmolested and unpursued. END
BEGIN NOW But there rose a shout and a wild hubbub END
BEGIN NOW When the dingo raced for his native scrub, END
BEGIN NOW And he paid right dear for his stolen meals END
BEGIN NOW With the drover's dogs at his wretched heels. END
BEGIN NOW For we ran him down at a rattling pace, END
BEGIN NOW While the packhorse joined in the stirring chase. END
BEGIN NOW And a wild halloo at the kill we'd raise -- END
BEGIN NOW We were light of heart in the droving days. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas a drover's horse, and my hand again END
BEGIN NOW Made a move to close on a fancied rein. END
BEGIN NOW For I felt the swing and the easy stride END
BEGIN NOW Of the grand old horse that I used to ride END
BEGIN NOW In drought or plenty, in good or ill, END
BEGIN NOW That same old steed was my comrade still; END
BEGIN NOW The old grey horse with his honest ways END
BEGIN NOW Was a mate to me in the droving days. END
BEGIN NOW When we kept our watch in the cold and damp, END
BEGIN NOW If the cattle broke from the sleeping camp, END
BEGIN NOW Over the flats and across the plain, END
BEGIN NOW With my head bent down on his waving mane, END
BEGIN NOW Through the boughs above and the stumps below END
BEGIN NOW On the darkest night I could let him go END
BEGIN NOW At a racing speed; he would choose his course, END
BEGIN NOW And my life was safe with the old grey horse. END
BEGIN NOW But man and horse had a favourite job, END
BEGIN NOW When an outlaw broke from a station mob, END
BEGIN NOW With a right good will was the stockwhip plied, END
BEGIN NOW As the old horse raced at the straggler's side, END
BEGIN NOW And the greenhide whip such a weal would raise, END
BEGIN NOW We could use the whip in the droving days. END
BEGIN NOW 'Only a pound!' and was this the end -- END
BEGIN NOW Only a pound for the drover's friend. END
BEGIN NOW The drover's friend that had seen his day, END
BEGIN NOW And now was worthless, and cast away END
BEGIN NOW With a broken knee and a broken heart END
BEGIN NOW To be flogged and starved in a hawker's cart. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I made a bid for a sense of shame END
BEGIN NOW And the memories dear of the good old game. END
BEGIN NOW 'Thank you? Guinea! and cheap at that! END
BEGIN NOW Against you there in the curly hat! END
BEGIN NOW Only a guinea, and one more chance, END
BEGIN NOW Down he goes if there's no advance, END
BEGIN NOW Third, and the last time, one! two! three!' END
BEGIN NOW And the old grey horse was knocked down to me. END
BEGIN NOW And now he's wandering, fat and sleek, END
BEGIN NOW On the lucerne flats by the Homestead Creek; END
BEGIN NOW I dare not ride him for fear he'd fall, END
BEGIN NOW But he does a journey to beat them all, END
BEGIN NOW For though he scarcely a trot can raise, END
BEGIN NOW He can take me back to the droving days. END
BEGIN NOW 'He was always his mother's idol, since ever his father died; END
BEGIN NOW Away in the gloomy ranges, at the foot of an ironbark, END
BEGIN NOW The bonnie, winsome laddie was lying stiff and stark; END
BEGIN NOW For the Reckless mare had smashed him against a leaning limb, END
BEGIN NOW And his comely face was battered, and his merry eyes were dim. END
BEGIN NOW But the mother pined and faded, and cried, and took no rest, END
BEGIN NOW And rode each day to the ranges on her hopeless, weary quest. END
BEGIN NOW Seeking her loved one ever, she faded and pined away, END
BEGIN NOW 'I know that sooner or later I shall find my boy,' she said. END

BEGIN NOW 'And what is this country like, my lass?' END
BEGIN NOW 'There are blossoming trees and pretty flowers, END

BEGIN NOW They never need work, nor want, nor weep; END
BEGIN NOW No troubles can come their hearts to estrange. END
BEGIN NOW Some summer night I shall fall asleep, END

BEGIN NOW For the wisest man knows no more than you END
BEGIN NOW Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust: END
BEGIN NOW Our views by a range are bounded too; END

BEGIN NOW Send for a cart to go down to our place with him' -- END
BEGIN NOW No use! One long sigh and the little chap's dead. END
BEGIN NOW Only a jockey-boy, foul-mouthed and bad you see, END
BEGIN NOW Ignorant, heathenish, gone to his rest. END
BEGIN NOW What did you do for him? -- bad was the best. END
BEGIN NOW Yearly you send your well-advertised hoard, END
BEGIN NOW But the poor jockey-boy -- shame on you, shame on you, END
BEGIN NOW 'Feed ye, my little ones' -- what said the Lord? END
BEGIN NOW Him ye held less than the outer barbarian, END
BEGIN NOW Left him to die in his ignorant sin; END
BEGIN NOW Have you no principles, humanitarian? END
BEGIN NOW Have you no precept -- 'go gather them in?' END
BEGIN NOW Knew he God's name? In his brutal profanity, END
BEGIN NOW That name was an oath -- out of many but one -- END
BEGIN NOW What did he get from our famed Christianity? END
BEGIN NOW Where has his soul -- if he had any -- gone? END
BEGIN NOW Fourteen years old, and what was he taught of it? END
BEGIN NOW What did he know of God's infinite grace? END
BEGIN NOW Draw the dark curtain of shame o'er the thought of it, END
BEGIN NOW Draw the shroud over the jockey-boy's face. END
BEGIN NOW Let us cease our idle chatter, END
BEGIN NOW Let the tears bedew our cheek, END
BEGIN NOW For a man from Tallangatta END
BEGIN NOW Has been missing for a week. END
BEGIN NOW Where the roaring flooded Murray END
BEGIN NOW Covered all the lower land, END
BEGIN NOW There he started in a hurry, END
BEGIN NOW With a bottle in his hand. END
BEGIN NOW And his fate is hid for ever, END
BEGIN NOW But the public seem to think END
BEGIN NOW That he slumbered by the river, END
BEGIN NOW 'Neath the influence of drink. END
BEGIN NOW And they scarcely seem to wonder END
BEGIN NOW That the river, wide and deep, END
BEGIN NOW Never woke him with its thunder, END
BEGIN NOW Never stirred him in his sleep. END
BEGIN NOW As the crashing logs came sweeping, END
BEGIN NOW And their tumult filled the air, END
BEGIN NOW Then M'Ginnis murmured, sleeping, END
BEGIN NOW ''Tis a wake in ould Kildare.' END
BEGIN NOW So the river rose and found him END
BEGIN NOW Sleeping softly by the stream, END
BEGIN NOW And the cruel waters drowned him END
BEGIN NOW Ere he wakened from his dream. END
BEGIN NOW And the blossom-tufted wattle, END
BEGIN NOW Blooming brightly on the lea, END
BEGIN NOW Saw M'Ginnis and the bottle END
BEGIN NOW Going drifting out to sea. END
BEGIN NOW A Voice from the Town END
BEGIN NOW A sequel to [Mowbray Morris's] 'A Voice from the Bush' END
BEGIN NOW I thought, in the days of the droving, END
BEGIN NOW Of steps I might hope to retrace, END
BEGIN NOW To be done with the bush and the roving END
BEGIN NOW And settle once more in my place. END
BEGIN NOW With a heart that was well nigh to breaking, END
BEGIN NOW In the long, lonely rides on the plain, END
BEGIN NOW I thought of the pleasure of taking END
BEGIN NOW The hand of a lady again. END
BEGIN NOW I am back into civilisation, END
BEGIN NOW Once more in the stir and the strife, END
BEGIN NOW But the old joys have lost their sensation -- END
BEGIN NOW The light has gone out of my life; END
BEGIN NOW The men of my time they have married, END
BEGIN NOW Made fortunes or gone to the wall; END
BEGIN NOW Too long from the scene I have tarried, END
BEGIN NOW And, somehow, I'm out of it all. END
BEGIN NOW For I go to the balls and the races END
BEGIN NOW A lonely companionless elf, END
BEGIN NOW And the ladies bestow all their graces END
BEGIN NOW On others less grey than myself; END
BEGIN NOW 'Midst youngsters that chatter and prate, END
BEGIN NOW And they call me 'the Man who was Someone END
BEGIN NOW Way back in the year Sixty-eight.' END
BEGIN NOW And I look, sour and old, at the dancers END
BEGIN NOW That swing to the strains of the band, END
BEGIN NOW And the ladies all give me the Lancers, END
BEGIN NOW No waltzes -- I quite understand. END
BEGIN NOW For matrons intent upon matching END
BEGIN NOW Their daughters with infinite push, END
BEGIN NOW Would scarce think him worthy the catching, END
BEGIN NOW The broken-down man from the bush. END
BEGIN NOW New partners have come and new faces, END
BEGIN NOW And I, of the bygone brigade, END
BEGIN NOW Sharply feel that oblivion my place is -- END
BEGIN NOW I must lie with the rest in the shade. END
BEGIN NOW And the youngsters, fresh-featured and pleasant, END
BEGIN NOW They live as we lived -- fairly fast; END
BEGIN NOW But I doubt if the men of the present END
BEGIN NOW Are as good as the men of the past. END
BEGIN NOW Of excitement and praise they are chary, END
BEGIN NOW There is nothing much good upon earth; END
BEGIN NOW Their watchword is _NIL ADMIRARI_, END
BEGIN NOW They are bored from the days of their birth. END
BEGIN NOW Where the life that we led was a revel END
BEGIN NOW They 'wince and relent and refrain' -- END
BEGIN NOW I could show them the road -- to the devil, END
BEGIN NOW Were I only a youngster again. END
BEGIN NOW I could show them the road where the stumps are END
BEGIN NOW The pleasures that end in remorse, END
BEGIN NOW And the game where the Devil's three trumps are, END
BEGIN NOW The woman, the card, and the horse. END
BEGIN NOW Shall the blind lead the blind -- shall the sower END
BEGIN NOW Of wind reap the storm as of yore? END
BEGIN NOW Though they get to their goal somewhat slower, END
BEGIN NOW They march where we hurried before. END
BEGIN NOW For the world never learns -- just as we did, END
BEGIN NOW They gallantly go to their fate, END
BEGIN NOW Unheeded all warnings, unheeded END
BEGIN NOW The maxims of elders sedate. END
BEGIN NOW As the husbandman, patiently toiling, END
BEGIN NOW Draws a harvest each year from the soil, END
BEGIN NOW So the fools grow afresh for the spoiling, END
BEGIN NOW And a new crop of thieves for the spoil. END
BEGIN NOW But a truce to this dull moralising, END
BEGIN NOW Let them drink while the drops are of gold, END
BEGIN NOW I have tasted the dregs -- 'twere surprising END
BEGIN NOW Were the new wine to me like the old; END
BEGIN NOW And I weary for lack of employment END
BEGIN NOW In idleness day after day, END
BEGIN NOW For the key to the door of enjoyment END
BEGIN NOW Is Youth -- and I've thrown it away. END
BEGIN NOW Roses ruddy and roses white, END
BEGIN NOW What are the joys that my heart discloses? END
BEGIN NOW Sitting alone in the fading light END
BEGIN NOW Memories come to me here to-night END
BEGIN NOW With the wonderful scent of the big red roses. END
BEGIN NOW Memories come as the daylight fades END
BEGIN NOW Down on the hearth where the firelight dozes; END
BEGIN NOW Flicker and flutter the lights and shades, END
BEGIN NOW And I see the face of a queen of maids END
BEGIN NOW Whose memory comes with the scent of roses. END
BEGIN NOW Visions arise of a scene of mirth, END
BEGIN NOW And a ball-room belle that superbly poses -- END
BEGIN NOW A queenly woman of queenly worth, END
BEGIN NOW And I am the happiest man on earth END
BEGIN NOW With a single flower from a bunch of roses. END
BEGIN NOW Only her memory lives to-night -- END
BEGIN NOW God in His wisdom her young life closes; END
BEGIN NOW Over her grave may the turf be light, END
BEGIN NOW Cover her coffin with roses white -- END
BEGIN NOW She was always fond of the big white roses. END
BEGIN NOW Such are the visions that fade away -- END
BEGIN NOW Man proposes and God disposes; END
BEGIN NOW Look in the glass and I see to-day END
BEGIN NOW Only an old man, worn and grey, END
BEGIN NOW Bending his head to a bunch of roses. END
BEGIN NOW As I lie at rest on a patch of clover END
BEGIN NOW In the Western Park when the day is done, END
BEGIN NOW I watch as the wild black swans fly over END
BEGIN NOW With their phalanx turned to the sinking sun; END
BEGIN NOW And I hear the clang of their leader crying END
BEGIN NOW To a lagging mate in the rearward flying, END
BEGIN NOW And they fade away in the darkness dying, END
BEGIN NOW Where the stars are mustering one by one. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! ye wild black swans, 'twere a world of wonder END
BEGIN NOW For a while to join in your westward flight, END
BEGIN NOW With the stars above and the dim earth under, END
BEGIN NOW Through the cooling air of the glorious night. END
BEGIN NOW As we swept along on our pinions winging, END
BEGIN NOW We should catch the chime of a church-bell ringing, END
BEGIN NOW Or the distant note of a torrent singing, END
BEGIN NOW Or the far-off flash of a station light. END
BEGIN NOW From the northern lakes with the reeds and rushes, END
BEGIN NOW Where the hills are clothed with a purple haze, END
BEGIN NOW Where the bell-birds chime and the songs of thrushes END
BEGIN NOW Make music sweet in the jungle maze, END
BEGIN NOW They will hold their course to the westward ever, END
BEGIN NOW Till they reach the banks of the old grey river, END
BEGIN NOW Where the waters wash, and the reed-beds quiver END
BEGIN NOW In the burning heat of the summer days. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! ye strange wild birds, will ye bear a greeting END
BEGIN NOW To the folk that live in that western land? END
BEGIN NOW Then for every sweep of your pinions beating, END
BEGIN NOW Ye shall bear a wish to the sunburnt band, END
BEGIN NOW To the stalwart men who are stoutly fighting END
BEGIN NOW With the heat and drought and the dust-storm smiting, END
BEGIN NOW Yet whose life somehow has a strange inviting, END
BEGIN NOW When once to the work they have put their hand. END
BEGIN NOW Facing it yet! Oh, my friend stout-hearted, END
BEGIN NOW What does it matter for rain or shine, END
BEGIN NOW For the hopes deferred and the gain departed? END
BEGIN NOW Nothing could conquer that heart of thine. END
BEGIN NOW And thy health and strength are beyond confessing END
BEGIN NOW As the only joys that are worth possessing. END
BEGIN NOW May the days to come be as rich in blessing END
BEGIN NOW As the days we spent in the auld lang syne. END
BEGIN NOW I would fain go back to the old grey river, END
BEGIN NOW To the old bush days when our hearts were light, END
BEGIN NOW But, alas! those days they have fled for ever, END
BEGIN NOW They are like the swans that have swept from sight. END
BEGIN NOW And I know full well that the strangers' faces END
BEGIN NOW Would meet us now in our dearest places; END
BEGIN NOW For our day is dead and has left no traces END
BEGIN NOW But the thoughts that live in my mind to-night. END
BEGIN NOW There are folk long dead, and our hearts would sicken -- END
BEGIN NOW We would grieve for them with a bitter pain, END
BEGIN NOW If the past could live and the dead could quicken, END
BEGIN NOW We then might turn to that life again. END
BEGIN NOW But on lonely nights we would hear them calling, END
BEGIN NOW We should hear their steps on the pathways falling, END
BEGIN NOW We should loathe the life with a hate appalling END
BEGIN NOW In our lonely rides by the ridge and plain. END
BEGIN NOW In the silent park is a scent of clover, END
BEGIN NOW And the distant roar of the town is dead, END
BEGIN NOW And I hear once more as the swans fly over END
BEGIN NOW Their far-off clamour from overhead. END
BEGIN NOW They are flying west, by their instinct guided, END
BEGIN NOW And for man likewise is his fate decided, END
BEGIN NOW And griefs apportioned and joys divided END
BEGIN NOW By a mighty power with a purpose dread. END
BEGIN NOW He came from 'further out', END
BEGIN NOW That land of heat and drought END
BEGIN NOW And dust and gravel. END
BEGIN NOW He got a touch of sun, END
BEGIN NOW And rested at the run END
BEGIN NOW Until his cure was done, END
BEGIN NOW And he could travel. END
BEGIN NOW When spring had decked the plain, END
BEGIN NOW He flitted off again END
BEGIN NOW As flit the swallows. END
BEGIN NOW And from that western land, END
BEGIN NOW When many months were spanned, END
BEGIN NOW A letter came to hand, END
BEGIN NOW Which read as follows: END
BEGIN NOW 'Dear sir, I take my pen END
BEGIN NOW In hopes that all your men END
BEGIN NOW And you are hearty. END
BEGIN NOW You think that I've forgot END
BEGIN NOW Your kindness, Mr. Scott, END
BEGIN NOW Oh, no, dear sir, I'm not END
BEGIN NOW That sort of party. END
BEGIN NOW 'You sometimes bet, I know, END
BEGIN NOW Well, now you'll have a show END
BEGIN NOW The 'books' to frighten. END
BEGIN NOW Up here at Wingadee END
BEGIN NOW We're training Strife, and he END
BEGIN NOW Is a all right 'un. END
BEGIN NOW 'Just now we're running byes, END
BEGIN NOW But, sir, first time he tries END
BEGIN NOW I'll send you word of. END
BEGIN NOW And running 'on the crook' END
BEGIN NOW Their measures we have took, END
BEGIN NOW It is the deadest hook END
BEGIN NOW You ever heard of. END
BEGIN NOW 'So when we lets him go, END
BEGIN NOW Why, then, I'll let you know, END
BEGIN NOW And you can have a show END
BEGIN NOW To put a mite on. END
BEGIN NOW Now, sir, my leave I'll take, END
BEGIN NOW Yours truly, William Blake. END
BEGIN NOW P.S. -- Make no mistake, END
BEGIN NOW By next week's _RIVERINE_ END
BEGIN NOW I saw my friend had been END
BEGIN NOW A bit too cunning. END
BEGIN NOW I read: 'The racehorse Strife END
BEGIN NOW And jockey William Fife END
BEGIN NOW Disqualified for life -- END
BEGIN NOW Suspicious running.' END
BEGIN NOW But though they spoilt his game, END
BEGIN NOW I reckon all the same END
BEGIN NOW I fairly ought to claim END
BEGIN NOW My friend a white 'un. END
BEGIN NOW For though he wasn't straight, END
BEGIN NOW His deeds would indicate END
BEGIN NOW His heart at any rate END
BEGIN NOW Was 'a all right 'un'. END
BEGIN NOW Did you ever hear tell of Chili? I was readin' the other day END
BEGIN NOW Of President Balmaceda and of how he was sent away. END
BEGIN NOW and then there's a truce declared, END
BEGIN NOW no odds were they small or great, END
BEGIN NOW Well, he was for Balmaceda, and after the war was done, END
BEGIN NOW And Balmaceda was beaten and his troops had been forced to run, END
BEGIN NOW The other man fetched his army and proceeded to do things brown, END
BEGIN NOW He marched 'em into the fortress and took command of the town. END
BEGIN NOW Cannon and guns and horses troopin' along the road, END
BEGIN NOW Rumblin' over the bridges, and never a foeman showed END
BEGIN NOW And there as they watched they noticed a flutter of crimson rag, END
BEGIN NOW And under their eyes he hoisted old Balmaceda's flag. END
BEGIN NOW Well, they sent him a civil message to say that the war was done, END
BEGIN NOW And them with their hundred cannon and him with a single gun: END
BEGIN NOW The odds were a trifle heavy -- but he wasn't the sort to flinch, END
BEGIN NOW They pounded his boat to pieces, they silenced his single gun, END
BEGIN NOW And captured the whole consignment, for none of 'em cared to run; END
BEGIN NOW They turn out the real Maginnis when it comes to an uphill fight. END
BEGIN NOW And General Alzereca was killed in the battle's front; END
BEGIN NOW A Bushman's Song END
BEGIN NOW I'm travellin' down the Castlereagh, and I'm a station hand, END
BEGIN NOW I'm handy with the ropin' pole, I'm handy with the brand, END
BEGIN NOW And I can ride a rowdy colt, or swing the axe all day, END
BEGIN NOW But there's no demand for a station-hand along the Castlereagh. END
BEGIN NOW So it's shift, boys, shift, for there isn't the slightest doubt END
BEGIN NOW That we've got to make a shift to the stations further out, END
BEGIN NOW With the pack-horse runnin' after, for he follows like a dog, END
BEGIN NOW We must strike across the country at the old jig-jog. END
BEGIN NOW He takes a lot of beatin', and the other day we tried, END
BEGIN NOW It was shift, boys, shift, for there wasn't the slightest doubt END
BEGIN NOW That I had to make him shift, for the money was nearly out; END
BEGIN NOW But he cantered home a winner, with the other one at the flog -- END
BEGIN NOW He's a red-hot sort to pick up with his old jig-jog. END
BEGIN NOW I asked a cove for shearin' once along the Marthaguy: END
BEGIN NOW 'We shear non-union here,' says he. 'I call it scab,' says I. END
BEGIN NOW I looked along the shearin' floor before I turned to go -- END
BEGIN NOW It was shift, boys, shift, for there wasn't the slightest doubt END
BEGIN NOW It was time to make a shift with the leprosy about. END
BEGIN NOW So I saddled up my horses, and I whistled to my dog, END
BEGIN NOW And I left his scabby station at the old jig-jog. END
BEGIN NOW I went to Illawarra, where my brother's got a farm, END
BEGIN NOW He has to ask his landlord's leave before he lifts his arm; END
BEGIN NOW The landlord owns the country side -- man, woman, dog, and cat, END
BEGIN NOW It was shift, boys, shift, for there wasn't the slightest doubt END
BEGIN NOW Their little landlord god and I would soon have fallen out; END
BEGIN NOW Was I to touch my hat to him? -- was I his bloomin' dog? END
BEGIN NOW So I makes for up the country at the old jig-jog. END
BEGIN NOW But it's time that I was movin', I've a mighty way to go END
BEGIN NOW Till I drink artesian water from a thousand feet below; END
BEGIN NOW Till I meet the overlanders with the cattle comin' down, END
BEGIN NOW So, it's shift, boys, shift, for there isn't the slightest doubt END
BEGIN NOW We've got to make a shift to the stations further out; END
BEGIN NOW The pack-horse runs behind us, for he follows like a dog, END
BEGIN NOW And we cross a lot of country at the old jig-jog. END
BEGIN NOW There's never a stone at the sleeper's head, END
BEGIN NOW There's never a fence beside, END
BEGIN NOW And the wandering stock on the grave may tread END
BEGIN NOW Unnoticed and undenied, END
BEGIN NOW But the smallest child on the Watershed END
BEGIN NOW Can tell you how Gilbert died. END
BEGIN NOW For he rode at dusk, with his comrade Dunn END
BEGIN NOW To the hut at the Stockman's Ford, END
BEGIN NOW In the waning light of the sinking sun END
BEGIN NOW They peered with a fierce accord. END
BEGIN NOW They were outlaws both -- and on each man's head END
BEGIN NOW Was a thousand pounds reward. END
BEGIN NOW They had taken toll of the country round, END
BEGIN NOW And the troopers came behind END
BEGIN NOW With a black that tracked like a human hound END
BEGIN NOW In the scrub and the ranges blind: END
BEGIN NOW He could run the trail where a white man's eye END
BEGIN NOW No sign of a track could find. END
BEGIN NOW He had hunted them out of the One Tree Hill END
BEGIN NOW And over the Old Man Plain, END
BEGIN NOW But they wheeled their tracks with a wild beast's skill, END
BEGIN NOW And they made for the range again. END
BEGIN NOW Then away to the hut where their grandsire dwelt, END
BEGIN NOW They rode with a loosened rein. END
BEGIN NOW And their grandsire gave them a greeting bold: END
BEGIN NOW 'Come in and rest in peace, END
BEGIN NOW No safer place does the country hold -- END
BEGIN NOW With the night pursuit must cease, END
BEGIN NOW And we'll drink success to the roving boys, END
BEGIN NOW And to hell with the black police.' END
BEGIN NOW But they went to death when they entered there, END
BEGIN NOW In the hut at the Stockman's Ford, END
BEGIN NOW For their grandsire's words were as false as fair -- END
BEGIN NOW They were doomed to the hangman's cord. END
BEGIN NOW He had sold them both to the black police END
BEGIN NOW For the sake of the big reward. END
BEGIN NOW In the depth of night there are forms that glide END
BEGIN NOW As stealthy as serpents creep, END
BEGIN NOW And around the hut where the outlaws hide END
BEGIN NOW They plant in the shadows deep, END
BEGIN NOW And they wait till the first faint flush of dawn END
BEGIN NOW Shall waken their prey from sleep. END
BEGIN NOW But Gilbert wakes while the night is dark -- END
BEGIN NOW A restless sleeper, aye, END
BEGIN NOW He has heard the sound of a sheep-dog's bark, END
BEGIN NOW And his horse's warning neigh, END
BEGIN NOW And he says to his mate, 'There are hawks abroad, END
BEGIN NOW And it's time that we went away.' END
BEGIN NOW Their rifles stood at the stretcher head, END
BEGIN NOW Their bridles lay to hand, END
BEGIN NOW They wakened the old man out of his bed, END
BEGIN NOW When they heard the sharp command: END
BEGIN NOW 'In the name of the Queen lay down your arms, END
BEGIN NOW Now, Dunn and Gilbert, stand!' END
BEGIN NOW Then Gilbert reached for his rifle true END
BEGIN NOW That close at his hand he kept, END
BEGIN NOW He pointed it straight at the voice and drew, END
BEGIN NOW But never a flash outleapt, END
BEGIN NOW For the water ran from the rifle breech -- END
BEGIN NOW It was drenched while the outlaws slept. END
BEGIN NOW Then he dropped the piece with a bitter oath, END
BEGIN NOW And he turned to his comrade Dunn: END
BEGIN NOW 'We are sold,' he said, 'we are dead men both, END
BEGIN NOW But there may be a chance for one; END
BEGIN NOW I'll stop and I'll fight with the pistol here, END
BEGIN NOW You take to your heels and run.' END
BEGIN NOW So Dunn crept out on his hands and knees END
BEGIN NOW In the dim, half-dawning light, END
BEGIN NOW And he made his way to a patch of trees, END
BEGIN NOW And vanished among the night, END
BEGIN NOW And the trackers hunted his tracks all day, END
BEGIN NOW But they never could trace his flight. END
BEGIN NOW But Gilbert walked from the open door END
BEGIN NOW In a confident style and rash; END
BEGIN NOW He heard at his side the rifles roar, END
BEGIN NOW And he heard the bullets crash. END
BEGIN NOW But he laughed as he lifted his pistol-hand, END
BEGIN NOW And he fired at the rifle flash. END
BEGIN NOW Then out of the shadows the troopers aimed END
BEGIN NOW At his voice and the pistol sound, END
BEGIN NOW With the rifle flashes the darkness flamed, END
BEGIN NOW He staggered and spun around, END
BEGIN NOW And they riddled his body with rifle balls END
BEGIN NOW As it lay on the blood-soaked ground. END
BEGIN NOW There's never a stone at the sleeper's head, END
BEGIN NOW There's never a fence beside, END
BEGIN NOW And the wandering stock on the grave may tread END
BEGIN NOW Unnoticed and undenied, END
BEGIN NOW But the smallest child on the Watershed END
BEGIN NOW Can tell you how Gilbert died. END
BEGIN NOW I served my time, in the days gone by, END
BEGIN NOW In the railway's clash and clang, END
BEGIN NOW And I worked my way to the end, and I END
BEGIN NOW Was the head of the 'Flying Gang'. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas a chosen band that was kept at hand END
BEGIN NOW In case of an urgent need, END
BEGIN NOW Was it south or north we were started forth, END
BEGIN NOW And away at our utmost speed. END
BEGIN NOW If word reached town that a bridge was down, END
BEGIN NOW The imperious summons rang -- END
BEGIN NOW 'Come out with the pilot engine sharp, END
BEGIN NOW And away with the flying gang.' END
BEGIN NOW Then a piercing scream and a rush of steam END
BEGIN NOW As the engine moved ahead, END
BEGIN NOW With a measured beat by the slum and street END
BEGIN NOW Of the busy town we fled, END
BEGIN NOW By the uplands bright and the homesteads white, END
BEGIN NOW With the rush of the western gale, END
BEGIN NOW And the pilot swayed with the pace we made END
BEGIN NOW As she rocked on the ringing rail. END
BEGIN NOW And the country children clapped their hands END
BEGIN NOW As the engine's echoes rang, END
BEGIN NOW But their elders said: 'There is work ahead END
BEGIN NOW When they send for the flying gang.' END
BEGIN NOW Then across the miles of the saltbush plain END
BEGIN NOW That gleamed with the morning dew, END
BEGIN NOW Where the grasses waved like the ripening grain END
BEGIN NOW The pilot engine flew, END
BEGIN NOW A fiery rush in the open bush END
BEGIN NOW Where the grade marks seemed to fly, END
BEGIN NOW And the order sped on the wires ahead, END
BEGIN NOW The pilot _MUST_ go by. END
BEGIN NOW The Governor's special must stand aside, END
BEGIN NOW And the fast express go hang, END
BEGIN NOW Let your orders be that the line is free END
BEGIN NOW For the boys of the flying gang. END
BEGIN NOW The bell is set a-ringing, and the engine gives a toot, END
BEGIN NOW There's five and thirty shearers here are shearing for the loot, END
BEGIN NOW So stir yourselves, you penners-up, and shove the sheep along, END
BEGIN NOW The musterers are fetching them a hundred thousand strong, END
BEGIN NOW And make your collie dogs speak up -- what would the buyers say END
BEGIN NOW In London if the wool was late this year from Castlereagh? END
BEGIN NOW The man that 'rung' the Tubbo shed is not the ringer here, END
BEGIN NOW That stripling from the Cooma side can teach him how to shear. END
BEGIN NOW They trim away the ragged locks, and rip the cutter goes, END
BEGIN NOW And leaves a track of snowy fleece from brisket to the nose; END
BEGIN NOW It's lovely how they peel it off with never stop nor stay, END
BEGIN NOW They're racing for the ringer's place this year at Castlereagh. END
BEGIN NOW The man that keeps the cutters sharp is growling in his cage, END
BEGIN NOW He's always in a hurry and he's always in a rage -- END
BEGIN NOW 'You clumsy-fisted mutton-heads, you'd turn a fellow sick, END
BEGIN NOW You pass yourselves as shearers, you were born to swing a pick. END
BEGIN NOW Another broken cutter here, that's two you've broke to-day, END
BEGIN NOW It's awful how such crawlers come to shear at Castlereagh.' END
BEGIN NOW The youngsters picking up the fleece enjoy the merry din, END
BEGIN NOW They throw the classer up the fleece, he throws it to the bin; END
BEGIN NOW The pressers standing by the rack are waiting for the wool, END
BEGIN NOW There's room for just a couple more, the press is nearly full; END
BEGIN NOW Now jump upon the lever, lads, and heave and heave away, END
BEGIN NOW Another bale of golden fleece is branded 'Castlereagh'. END
BEGIN NOW The Wind's Message END
BEGIN NOW There came a whisper down the Bland between the dawn and dark, END
BEGIN NOW Above the tossing of the pines, above the river's flow; END
BEGIN NOW It stirred the boughs of giant gums and stalwart ironbark; END
BEGIN NOW It drifted where the wild ducks played amid the swamps below; END
BEGIN NOW It brought a breath of mountain air from off the hills of pine, END
BEGIN NOW A scent of eucalyptus trees in honey-laden bloom; END
BEGIN NOW And drifting, drifting far away along the southern line END
BEGIN NOW It caught from leaf and grass and fern a subtle strange perfume. END
BEGIN NOW And others heard the whisper pass, but could not understand END
BEGIN NOW The magic of the breeze's breath that set their hearts aglow, END
BEGIN NOW Nor how the roving wind could bring across the Overland END
BEGIN NOW A sound of voices silent now and songs of long ago. END
BEGIN NOW The mighty rolling western plains are very fair to see, END
BEGIN NOW Where waving to the passing breeze the silver myalls stand, END
BEGIN NOW But fairer are the giant hills, all rugged though they be, END
BEGIN NOW From which the two great rivers rise that run along the Bland. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! rocky range and rugged spur and river running clear, END
BEGIN NOW The message that the breezes bring to call the wanderers home. END
BEGIN NOW And we shall live to see once more those sunny southern hills, END
BEGIN NOW And strike once more the bridle track that leads along the Bland. END
BEGIN NOW Johnson's Antidote END
BEGIN NOW Down along the Snakebite River, where the overlanders camp, END
BEGIN NOW Where the serpents are in millions, all of the most deadly stamp; END
BEGIN NOW Mixes up among the doughboys half-a-dozen poison-snakes: END
BEGIN NOW Where the wily free-selector walks in armour-plated pants, END
BEGIN NOW There it was that William Johnson sought his snake-bite antidote. END
BEGIN NOW Johnson was a free-selector, and his brain went rather queer, END
BEGIN NOW For the constant sight of serpents filled him with a deadly fear; END
BEGIN NOW Old goanna cure himself with eating little pfeller tree.' END
BEGIN NOW Thus it came to pass that Johnson, having got the tale by rote, END
BEGIN NOW Followed every stray goanna, seeking for the antidote. END
BEGIN NOW Saw him, happy and contented, lick his lips, as off he crept, END
BEGIN NOW While the bulging in his stomach showed where his opponent slept. END
BEGIN NOW 'Here it is, the Grand Elixir, greatest blessing ever known, END
BEGIN NOW Twenty thousand men in India die each year of snakes alone. END
BEGIN NOW Saved from sudden expiration, by my wondrous snakebite cure. END
BEGIN NOW It will bring me fame and fortune! In the happy days to be, END
BEGIN NOW Men of every clime and nation will be round to gaze on me -- END
BEGIN NOW Scientific men in thousands, men of mark and men of note, END
BEGIN NOW Rushing down the Mooki River, after Johnson's antidote. END
BEGIN NOW It will cure Delirium Tremens, when the patient's eyeballs stare END
BEGIN NOW At imaginary spiders, snakes which really are not there. END
BEGIN NOW Then he rushed to the museum, found a scientific man -- END
BEGIN NOW 'Trot me out a deadly serpent, just the deadliest you can; END
BEGIN NOW I intend to let him bite me, all the risk I will endure, END
BEGIN NOW Just to prove the sterling value of my wondrous snakebite cure. END
BEGIN NOW Even though an adder bit me, back to life again I'd float; END
BEGIN NOW Said the scientific person, 'If you really want to die, END
BEGIN NOW Give your dog the snakebite mixture, let the other fellow rip; END
BEGIN NOW Both the dogs were duly loaded with the poison-gland's contents; END
BEGIN NOW Johnson gave his dog the mixture, then sat down to wait events. END
BEGIN NOW 'Mark,' he said, 'in twenty minutes Stump'll be a-rushing round, END
BEGIN NOW While the other wretched creature lies a corpse upon the ground.' END
BEGIN NOW And the scientific person hurried off with utmost speed, END
BEGIN NOW Tested Johnson's drug and found it was a deadly poison-weed; END
BEGIN NOW Half a tumbler killed an emu, half a spoonful killed a goat, END
BEGIN NOW All the snakes on earth were harmless to that awful antidote. END
BEGIN NOW Down along the Mooki River, on the overlanders' camp, END
BEGIN NOW Where the serpents are in millions, all of the most deadly stamp, END
BEGIN NOW Somehow seems to dodge the subject of the snake-bite antidote. END
BEGIN NOW I am the maid of the lustrous eyes END
BEGIN NOW Of great fruition, END
BEGIN NOW Whom the sons of men that are over-wise END
BEGIN NOW Have called Ambition. END
BEGIN NOW And the world's success is the only goal END
BEGIN NOW I have within me; END
BEGIN NOW The meanest man with the smallest soul END
BEGIN NOW May woo and win me. END
BEGIN NOW For the lust of power and the pride of place END
BEGIN NOW To all I proffer. END
BEGIN NOW Wilt thou take thy part in the crowded race END
BEGIN NOW For what I offer? END
BEGIN NOW The choice is thine, and the world is wide -- END
BEGIN NOW Thy path is lonely. END
BEGIN NOW I may not lead and I may not guide -- END
BEGIN NOW I urge thee only. END
BEGIN NOW I am just a whip and a spur that smites END
BEGIN NOW To fierce endeavour. END
BEGIN NOW In the restless days and the sleepless nights END
BEGIN NOW I urge thee ever. END
BEGIN NOW Thou shalt wake from sleep with a startled cry, END
BEGIN NOW In fright upleaping END
BEGIN NOW At a rival's step as it passes by END
BEGIN NOW Whilst thou art sleeping. END
BEGIN NOW Honour and truth shall be overthrown END
BEGIN NOW In fierce desire; END
BEGIN NOW Thou shalt use thy friend as a stepping-stone END
BEGIN NOW To mount thee higher. END
BEGIN NOW When the curtain falls on the sordid strife END
BEGIN NOW That seemed so splendid, END
BEGIN NOW Thou shalt look with pain on the wasted life END
BEGIN NOW That thou hast ended. END
BEGIN NOW Thou hast sold thy life for a guerdon small END
BEGIN NOW In fitful flashes; END
BEGIN NOW There has been reward -- but the end of all END
BEGIN NOW Is dust and ashes. END
BEGIN NOW For the night has come and it brings to naught END
BEGIN NOW Thy projects cherished, END
BEGIN NOW And thine epitaph shall in brass be wrought -- END
BEGIN NOW 'He lived and perished.' END
BEGIN NOW I wait for thee at the outer gate, END
BEGIN NOW My love, mine only; END
BEGIN NOW Wherefore tarriest thou so late END
BEGIN NOW While I am lonely. END
BEGIN NOW Thou shalt seek my side with a footstep swift, END
BEGIN NOW In thee implanted END
BEGIN NOW Is the love of Art and the greatest gift END
BEGIN NOW That God has granted. END
BEGIN NOW And the world's concerns with its rights and wrongs END
BEGIN NOW Shall seem but small things -- END
BEGIN NOW Poet or painter, a singer of songs, END
BEGIN NOW Thine art is all things. END
BEGIN NOW For the wine of life is a woman's love END
BEGIN NOW To keep beside thee; END
BEGIN NOW But the love of Art is a thing above -- END

BEGIN NOW As the years go by with thy love of Art END
BEGIN NOW All undiminished, END
BEGIN NOW Thou shalt end thy days with a quiet heart -- END
BEGIN NOW Thy work is finished. END
BEGIN NOW So the painter fashions a picture strong END
BEGIN NOW That fadeth never, END
BEGIN NOW And the singer singeth a wond'rous song END
BEGIN NOW That lives for ever. END
BEGIN NOW The daylight is dying END
BEGIN NOW Away in the west, END
BEGIN NOW The wild birds are flying END
BEGIN NOW In silence to rest; END
BEGIN NOW Where shadows are deep, END
BEGIN NOW They pass to its bondage -- END
BEGIN NOW The kingdom of sleep. END
BEGIN NOW And watched in their sleeping END
BEGIN NOW By stars in the height, END
BEGIN NOW They rest in your keeping, END
BEGIN NOW Oh, wonderful night. END
BEGIN NOW When night doth her glories END
BEGIN NOW Of starshine unfold, END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis then that the stories END

BEGIN NOW Unnumbered I hold them END
BEGIN NOW In memories bright, END
BEGIN NOW But who could unfold them, END
BEGIN NOW Or read them aright? END
BEGIN NOW Beyond all denials END
BEGIN NOW The stars in their glories END
BEGIN NOW The breeze in the myalls END
BEGIN NOW Are part of these stories. END
BEGIN NOW The waving of grasses, END
BEGIN NOW The song of the river END
BEGIN NOW That sings as it passes END
BEGIN NOW For ever and ever, END
BEGIN NOW The hobble-chains' rattle, END
BEGIN NOW The calling of birds, END
BEGIN NOW The lowing of cattle END
BEGIN NOW Must blend with the words. END
BEGIN NOW Without these, indeed, you END
BEGIN NOW Would find it ere long, END
BEGIN NOW As though I should read you END
BEGIN NOW The words of a song END
BEGIN NOW That lamely would linger END
BEGIN NOW When lacking the rune, END
BEGIN NOW The voice of the singer, END
BEGIN NOW The lilt of the tune. END
BEGIN NOW But, as one half-hearing END
BEGIN NOW An old-time refrain, END
BEGIN NOW With memory clearing, END
BEGIN NOW Recalls it again, END
BEGIN NOW These tales, roughly wrought of END
BEGIN NOW The bush and its ways, END
BEGIN NOW May call back a thought of END
BEGIN NOW The wandering days, END
BEGIN NOW And, blending with each END
BEGIN NOW In the mem'ries that throng, END
BEGIN NOW There haply shall reach END
BEGIN NOW You some echo of song. END
BEGIN NOW Well, we grieve to disappoint you, and it makes us sad to hear END
BEGIN NOW That it wasn't cool and shady -- and there wasn't plenty beer, END
BEGIN NOW And the loony bullock snorted when you first came into view; END
BEGIN NOW Well, you know it's not so often that he sees a swell like you; END
BEGIN NOW Where the sunbaked earth was gasping like a creature in its pain END
BEGIN NOW You would find the grasses waving like a field of summer grain, END
BEGIN NOW But you found the bush was dismal and a land of no delight, END
BEGIN NOW Did you chance to hear a chorus in the shearers' huts at night? END
BEGIN NOW Than the little city urchins who would greet you with a curse? END
BEGIN NOW Is not such a life much better than the squalid street and square END
BEGIN NOW Did you hear no sweeter voices in the music of the bush END
BEGIN NOW Would you make it a tea-garden and on Sundays have a band END
BEGIN NOW Where the 'blokes' might take their 'donahs', END
BEGIN NOW with a 'public' close at hand? END
BEGIN NOW You had better stick to Sydney and make merry with the 'push', END
BEGIN NOW For the bush will never suit you, and you'll never suit the bush. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, the new-chum went to the back block run, END
BEGIN NOW But he should have gone there last week. END
BEGIN NOW He tramped ten miles with a loaded gun, END
BEGIN NOW But of turkey or duck he saw never a one, END
BEGIN NOW For he should have been there last week, END
BEGIN NOW They said, END
BEGIN NOW There were flocks of 'em there last week. END
BEGIN NOW He wended his way to a waterfall, END
BEGIN NOW And he should have gone there last week. END
BEGIN NOW He carried a camera, legs and all, END
BEGIN NOW But the day was hot, and the stream was small, END
BEGIN NOW For he should have gone there last week, END
BEGIN NOW They said. END
BEGIN NOW They drowned a man there last week. END
BEGIN NOW He went for a drive, and he made a start, END
BEGIN NOW Which should have been made last week, END
BEGIN NOW For the old horse died of a broken heart; END
BEGIN NOW So he footed it home and he dragged the cart -- END
BEGIN NOW But the horse was all right last week, END
BEGIN NOW They said. END
BEGIN NOW He trotted a match last week. END
BEGIN NOW So he asked the bushies who came from far END
BEGIN NOW To visit the town last week, END
BEGIN NOW If they'd dine with him, and they said 'Hurrah!' END
BEGIN NOW But there wasn't a drop in the whisky jar -- END
BEGIN NOW You should have been here last week, END
BEGIN NOW He said, END
BEGIN NOW I drank it all up last week! END
BEGIN NOW The shearers sat in the firelight, hearty and hale and strong, END
BEGIN NOW After the hard day's shearing, passing the joke along: END
BEGIN NOW where the skies like a furnace glow, END
BEGIN NOW And men from the Snowy River, the land of the frozen snow; END
BEGIN NOW He lingered over them fondly, because they recalled to mind END
BEGIN NOW Most of the names are easy -- short for a man to say. END
BEGIN NOW 'You've heard of Mungrybambone and the Gundabluey pine, END
BEGIN NOW But the rest of the shearers stopped him: END
BEGIN NOW 'For the sake of your jaw, go slow, END
BEGIN NOW On the outer Barcoo where the churches are few, END
BEGIN NOW And men of religion are scanty, END
BEGIN NOW On a road never cross'd 'cept by folk that are lost, END
BEGIN NOW One Michael Magee had a shanty. END
BEGIN NOW Now this Mike was the dad of a ten year old lad, END
BEGIN NOW Plump, healthy, and stoutly conditioned; END
BEGIN NOW He was strong as the best, but poor Mike had no rest END
BEGIN NOW For the youngster had never been christened. END
BEGIN NOW And his wife used to cry, 'If the darlin' should die END
BEGIN NOW Saint Peter would not recognise him.' END
BEGIN NOW But by luck he survived till a preacher arrived, END
BEGIN NOW Who agreed straightaway to baptise him. END
BEGIN NOW Now the artful young rogue, while they held their collogue, END
BEGIN NOW With his ear to the keyhole was listenin', END
BEGIN NOW And he muttered in fright, while his features turned white, END
BEGIN NOW 'What the divil and all is this christenin'?' END
BEGIN NOW He was none of your dolts, he had seen them brand colts, END
BEGIN NOW And it seemed to his small understanding, END
BEGIN NOW If the man in the frock made him one of the flock, END
BEGIN NOW It must mean something very like branding. END
BEGIN NOW So away with a rush he set off for the bush, END
BEGIN NOW While the tears in his eyelids they glistened -- END
BEGIN NOW ''Tis outrageous,' says he, 'to brand youngsters like me, END
BEGIN NOW I'll be dashed if I'll stop to be christened!' END
BEGIN NOW Like a young native dog he ran into a log, END
BEGIN NOW And his father with language uncivil, END
BEGIN NOW Never heeding the 'praste' cried aloud in his haste, END
BEGIN NOW 'Come out and be christened, you divil!' END
BEGIN NOW But he lay there as snug as a bug in a rug, END
BEGIN NOW And his parents in vain might reprove him, END
BEGIN NOW Till his reverence spoke (he was fond of a joke) END
BEGIN NOW 'I've a notion,' says he, 'that'll move him.' END
BEGIN NOW 'Poke a stick up the log, give the spalpeen a prog; END
BEGIN NOW Poke him aisy -- don't hurt him or maim him, END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis not long that he'll stand, I've the water at hand, END
BEGIN NOW As he rushes out this end I'll name him. END
BEGIN NOW 'Here he comes, and for shame! ye've forgotten the name -- END
BEGIN NOW Here the youngster ran out, and the priest gave a shout -- END
BEGIN NOW 'Take your chance, anyhow, wid 'Maginnis'!' END
BEGIN NOW As the howling young cub ran away to the scrub END
BEGIN NOW Where he knew that pursuit would be risky, END
BEGIN NOW The priest, as he fled, flung a flask at his head END
BEGIN NOW That was labelled '_MAGINNIS'S WHISKY_'! END
BEGIN NOW And Maginnis Magee has been made a J.P., END
BEGIN NOW And the one thing he hates more than sin is END
BEGIN NOW To be asked by the folk, who have heard of the joke, END
BEGIN NOW How he came to be christened 'Maginnis'! END
BEGIN NOW 'Aye,' said the boozer, 'I tell you it's true, sir, END
BEGIN NOW I once was a punter with plenty of pelf, END
BEGIN NOW But gone is my glory, I'll tell you the story END
BEGIN NOW How I stiffened my horse and got stiffened myself. END
BEGIN NOW ''Twas a mare called the Cracker, I came down to back her, END
BEGIN NOW But found she was favourite all of a rush, END
BEGIN NOW The folk just did pour on to lay six to four on, END
BEGIN NOW And several bookies were killed in the crush. END
BEGIN NOW 'It seems old Tomato was stiff, though a starter; END
BEGIN NOW They reckoned him fit for the Caulfield to keep. END
BEGIN NOW The Bloke and the Donah were scratched by their owner, END
BEGIN NOW He only was offered three-fourths of the sweep. END
BEGIN NOW 'We knew Salamander was slow as a gander, END
BEGIN NOW The mare could have beat him the length of the straight, END
BEGIN NOW And old Manumission was out of condition, END
BEGIN NOW And most of the others were running off weight. END
BEGIN NOW 'No doubt someone 'blew it', for everyone knew it, END
BEGIN NOW The bets were all gone, and I muttered in spite END
BEGIN NOW 'If I can't get a copper, by Jingo, I'll stop her, END
BEGIN NOW Let the public fall in, it will serve the brutes right.' END
BEGIN NOW 'I said to the jockey, 'Now, listen, my cocky, END
BEGIN NOW You watch as you're cantering down by the stand, END
BEGIN NOW I'll wait where that toff is and give you the office, END
BEGIN NOW You're only to win if I lift up my hand.' END
BEGIN NOW 'I then tried to back her -- 'What price is the Cracker?' END
BEGIN NOW 'Our books are all full, sir,' each bookie did swear; END
BEGIN NOW My mind, then, I made up, my fortune I played up END
BEGIN NOW I bet every shilling against my own mare. END
BEGIN NOW 'I strolled to the gateway, the mare in the straightway END
BEGIN NOW Was shifting and dancing, and pawing the ground, END
BEGIN NOW The boy saw me enter and wheeled for his canter, END
BEGIN NOW When a darned great mosquito came buzzing around. END
BEGIN NOW 'They breed 'em at Hexham, it's risky to vex 'em, END
BEGIN NOW They suck a man dry at a sitting, no doubt, END
BEGIN NOW But just as the mare passed, he fluttered my hair past, END
BEGIN NOW I lifted my hand, and I flattened him out. END
BEGIN NOW 'I was stunned when they started, the mare simply darted END
BEGIN NOW Away to the front when the flag was let fall, END
BEGIN NOW For none there could match her, and none tried to catch her -- END
BEGIN NOW She finished a furlong in front of them all. END
BEGIN NOW 'You bet that I went for the boy, whom I sent for END
BEGIN NOW The moment he weighed and came out of the stand -- END
BEGIN NOW 'Who paid you to win it? Come, own up this minute.' END
BEGIN NOW 'Lord love yer,' said he, 'why you lifted your hand.' END
BEGIN NOW ''Twas true, by St. Peter, that cursed 'muskeeter' END
BEGIN NOW Had broke me so broke that I hadn't a brown, END
BEGIN NOW And you'll find the best course is when dealing with horses END
BEGIN NOW To win when you're able, and _KEEP YOUR HANDS DOWN_. END
BEGIN NOW MacFierce'un came to Whiskeyhurst END
BEGIN NOW When summer days were hot, END
BEGIN NOW And bided there wi' Jock McThirst, END
BEGIN NOW A brawny brother Scot. END
BEGIN NOW Gude Faith! They made the whisky fly, END
BEGIN NOW Like Highland chieftains true, END
BEGIN NOW And when they'd drunk the beaker dry END
BEGIN NOW They sang 'We are nae fou!' END
BEGIN NOW 'There is nae folk like oor ain folk, END
BEGIN NOW Sae gallant and sae true.' END
BEGIN NOW They sang the only Scottish joke END
BEGIN NOW Which is, 'We are nae fou.' END
BEGIN NOW Said bold McThirst, 'Let Saxons jaw END
BEGIN NOW Aboot their great concerns, END
BEGIN NOW But bonny Scotland beats them a', END
BEGIN NOW The land o' cakes and Burns, END
BEGIN NOW The land o' partridge, deer, and grouse, END
BEGIN NOW Fill up your glass, I beg, END
BEGIN NOW There's muckle whusky i' the house, END
BEGIN NOW Forbye what's in the keg.' END
BEGIN NOW And here a hearty laugh he laughed, END
BEGIN NOW 'Just come wi' me, I beg.' END
BEGIN NOW MacFierce'un saw with pleasure daft END
BEGIN NOW A fifty-gallon keg. END
BEGIN NOW 'Losh, man, that's grand,' MacFierce'un cried, END
BEGIN NOW 'Saw ever man the like, END
BEGIN NOW Now, wi' the daylight, I maun ride END
BEGIN NOW To meet a Southron tyke, END
BEGIN NOW But I'll be back ere summer's gone, END
BEGIN NOW So bide for me, I beg, END
BEGIN NOW We'll make a grand assault upon END
BEGIN NOW Yon deevil of a keg.' END
BEGIN NOW MacFierce'un rode to Whiskeyhurst, END
BEGIN NOW When summer days were gone, END
BEGIN NOW And there he met with Jock McThirst END
BEGIN NOW Was greetin' all alone. END
BEGIN NOW 'McThirst what gars ye look sae blank? END
BEGIN NOW Have all yer wits gane daft? END
BEGIN NOW Has that accursed Southron bank END
BEGIN NOW Called up your overdraft? END
BEGIN NOW Is all your grass burnt up wi' drouth? END
BEGIN NOW Is wool and hides gone flat?' END
BEGIN NOW McThirst replied, 'Gude friend, in truth, END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis muckle waur than that.' END
BEGIN NOW 'Has sair misfortune cursed your life END
BEGIN NOW That you should weep sae free? END
BEGIN NOW Is harm upon your bonny wife, END
BEGIN NOW The children at your knee? END
BEGIN NOW Is scaith upon your house and hame?' END
BEGIN NOW McThirst upraised his head: END
BEGIN NOW 'My bairns hae done the deed of shame -- END
BEGIN NOW 'Twere better they were dead. END
BEGIN NOW 'To think my bonny infant son END
BEGIN NOW Should do the deed o' guilt -- END
BEGIN NOW Upon them both these words did bring END
BEGIN NOW A solemn silence deep, END
BEGIN NOW Gude faith, it is a fearsome thing END
BEGIN NOW To see two strong men weep. END
BEGIN NOW Come-by-Chance END
BEGIN NOW As I pondered very weary o'er a volume long and dreary -- END
BEGIN NOW Of each township, town, and village in the radius of the Act. END
BEGIN NOW And I learnt that Puckawidgee stands beside the Murrumbidgee, END
BEGIN NOW And that Booleroi and Bumble get their letters twice a year, END
BEGIN NOW Also that the post inspector, when he visited Collector, END
BEGIN NOW Closed the office up instanter, and re-opened Dungalear. END
BEGIN NOW But my languid mood forsook me, when I found a name that took me, END
BEGIN NOW Just an N which stood for northward, and the rest was all unsaid. END
BEGIN NOW Where the telegraph don't reach you nor the railways run to town. END
BEGIN NOW And one's letters and exchanges come by chance across the ranges, END
BEGIN NOW Under the Shadow of Kiley's Hill END
BEGIN NOW This is the place where they all were bred; END
BEGIN NOW Some of the rafters are standing still; END
BEGIN NOW Now they are scattered and lost and dead, END
BEGIN NOW Every one from the old nest fled, END
BEGIN NOW Out of the shadow of Kiley's Hill. END
BEGIN NOW Better it is that they ne'er came back -- END
BEGIN NOW Changes and chances are quickly rung; END
BEGIN NOW Now the old homestead is gone to rack, END
BEGIN NOW Green is the grass on the well-worn track END
BEGIN NOW Down by the gate where the roses clung. END
BEGIN NOW Gone is the garden they kept with care; END
BEGIN NOW Left to decay at its own sweet will, END
BEGIN NOW Fruit trees and flower beds eaten bare, END
BEGIN NOW Cattle and sheep where the roses were, END
BEGIN NOW Under the shadow of Kiley's Hill. END
BEGIN NOW Where are the children that throve and grew END
BEGIN NOW In the old homestead in days gone by? END
BEGIN NOW One is away on the far Barcoo END
BEGIN NOW Watching his cattle the long year through, END
BEGIN NOW Watching them starve in the droughts and die. END
BEGIN NOW One in the town where all cares are rife, END
BEGIN NOW Weary with troubles that cramp and kill, END
BEGIN NOW Fain would be done with the restless strife, END
BEGIN NOW Fain would go back to the old bush life, END
BEGIN NOW Back to the shadow of Kiley's Hill. END
BEGIN NOW One is away on the roving quest, END
BEGIN NOW Seeking his share of the golden spoil, END
BEGIN NOW Out in the wastes of the trackless west, END
BEGIN NOW Wandering ever he gives the best END
BEGIN NOW Of his years and strength to the hopeless toil. END
BEGIN NOW What of the parents? That unkept mound END
BEGIN NOW Shows where they slumber united still; END
BEGIN NOW Rough is their grave, but they sleep as sound END
BEGIN NOW Out on the range as on holy ground, END
BEGIN NOW Under the shadow of Kiley's Hill. END
BEGIN NOW Born of a thoroughbred English race, END
BEGIN NOW Well proportioned and closely knit, END
BEGIN NOW Neat of figure and handsome face, END
BEGIN NOW Always ready and always fit, END
BEGIN NOW Hard and wiry of limb and thew, END
BEGIN NOW That was the ne'er-do-well Jim Carew. END
BEGIN NOW One of the sons of the good old land -- END
BEGIN NOW Many a year since his like was known; END
BEGIN NOW Never a game but he took command, END
BEGIN NOW Never a sport but he held his own; END
BEGIN NOW Gained at his college a triple blue -- END
BEGIN NOW Good as they make them was Jim Carew. END
BEGIN NOW Came to grief -- was it card or horse? END
BEGIN NOW Nobody asked and nobody cared; END
BEGIN NOW Ship him away to the bush of course, END
BEGIN NOW Ne'er-do-well fellows are easily spared; END
BEGIN NOW Only of women a tolerable few END
BEGIN NOW Sorrowed at parting with Jim Carew. END
BEGIN NOW Gentleman Jim on the cattle camp, END
BEGIN NOW Sitting his horse with an easy grace; END
BEGIN NOW But the reckless living has left its stamp END
BEGIN NOW In the deep drawn lines of that handsome face, END
BEGIN NOW And a harder look in those eyes of blue: END
BEGIN NOW Prompt at a quarrel is Jim Carew. END
BEGIN NOW Billy the Lasher was out for gore -- END
BEGIN NOW Twelve-stone navvy with chest of hair, END
BEGIN NOW When he opened out with a hungry roar END
BEGIN NOW On a ten-stone man it was hardly fair; END
BEGIN NOW But his wife was wise if his face she knew END
BEGIN NOW By the time you were done with him, Jim Carew. END
BEGIN NOW Gentleman Jim in the stockmen's hut END
BEGIN NOW Works with them, toils with them, side by side; END
BEGIN NOW As to his past -- well, his lips are shut. END
BEGIN NOW 'Gentleman once,' say his mates with pride; END
BEGIN NOW And the wildest Cornstalk can ne'er outdo END
BEGIN NOW In feats of recklessness, Jim Carew. END
BEGIN NOW What should he live for? A dull despair! END
BEGIN NOW Drink is his master and drags him down, END
BEGIN NOW Water of Lethe that drowns all care. END
BEGIN NOW Gentleman Jim has a lot to drown, END
BEGIN NOW And he reigns as king with a drunken crew, END
BEGIN NOW Sinking to misery, Jim Carew. END
BEGIN NOW Such is the end of the ne'er-do-well -- END
BEGIN NOW Jimmy the Boozer, all down at heel; END
BEGIN NOW But he straightens up when he's asked to tell END
BEGIN NOW His name and race, and a flash of steel END
BEGIN NOW Still lightens up in those eyes of blue -- END
BEGIN NOW The Swagman's Rest END
BEGIN NOW We buried old Bob where the bloodwoods wave END
BEGIN NOW At the foot of the Eaglehawk; END
BEGIN NOW We fashioned a cross on the old man's grave, END
BEGIN NOW For fear that his ghost might walk; END
BEGIN NOW We carved his name on a bloodwood tree, END
BEGIN NOW With the date of his sad decease, END
BEGIN NOW And in place of 'Died from effects of spree', END
BEGIN NOW We wrote 'May he rest in peace'. END
BEGIN NOW For Bob was known on the Overland, END
BEGIN NOW A regular old bush wag, END
BEGIN NOW Tramping along in the dust and sand, END
BEGIN NOW Humping his well-worn swag. END
BEGIN NOW He would camp for days in the river-bed, END
BEGIN NOW And loiter and 'fish for whales'. END
BEGIN NOW 'I'm into the swagman's yard,' he said, END
BEGIN NOW 'And I never shall find the rails.' END
BEGIN NOW But he found the rails on that summer night END
BEGIN NOW For a better place -- or worse, END
BEGIN NOW As we watched by turns in the flickering light END
BEGIN NOW With an old black gin for nurse. END
BEGIN NOW The breeze came in with the scent of pine, END
BEGIN NOW The river sounded clear, END
BEGIN NOW When a change came on, and we saw the sign END
BEGIN NOW That told us the end was near. END
BEGIN NOW But he spoke in a cultured voice and low -- END
BEGIN NOW 'I fancy they've "sent the route"; END
BEGIN NOW I once was an army man, you know, END
BEGIN NOW Though now I'm a drunken brute; END
BEGIN NOW But bury me out where the bloodwoods wave, END
BEGIN NOW And if ever you're fairly stuck, END
BEGIN NOW Just take and shovel me out of the grave END
BEGIN NOW And, maybe, I'll bring you luck. END
BEGIN NOW 'For I've always heard --' here his voice fell weak, END
BEGIN NOW His strength was well-nigh sped, END
BEGIN NOW He gasped and struggled and tried to speak, END
BEGIN NOW Then fell in a moment -- dead. END
BEGIN NOW Thus ended a wasted life and hard, END
BEGIN NOW Of energies misapplied -- END
BEGIN NOW Old Bob was out of the 'swagman's yard' END
BEGIN NOW And over the Great Divide. END
BEGIN NOW The drought came down on the field and flock, END
BEGIN NOW And never a raindrop fell, END
BEGIN NOW Though the tortured moans of the starving stock END
BEGIN NOW Might soften a fiend from hell. END
BEGIN NOW And we thought of the hint that the swagman gave END
BEGIN NOW When he went to the Great Unseen -- END
BEGIN NOW We shovelled the skeleton out of the grave END
BEGIN NOW To see what his hint might mean. END
BEGIN NOW We dug where the cross and the grave posts were, END
BEGIN NOW We shovelled away the mould, END
BEGIN NOW When sudden a vein of quartz lay bare END
BEGIN NOW All gleaming with yellow gold. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas a reef with never a fault nor baulk END
BEGIN NOW That ran from the range's crest, END
BEGIN NOW And the richest mine on the Eaglehawk END
BEGIN NOW Is known as 'The Swagman's Rest'. END

BEGIN NOW For the sake of that other Lang Syne, END
BEGIN NOW When the tracks lay divided before us, END

BEGIN NOW Down the street as I was drifting with the city's human tide, END
BEGIN NOW of the days when the world was wide. END
BEGIN NOW When the North was hale in the march of Time, END

BEGIN NOW in the days when the world was wide. END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW With its dull, brown days of a-shilling-an-hour END
BEGIN NOW the dreary year drags round: END

BEGIN NOW -- the bourne of the Outward Bound? END
BEGIN NOW We'll fight till the world grows wide!' END
BEGIN NOW They lie, the men who tell us in a loud decisive tone END
BEGIN NOW That want is here a stranger, and that misery's unknown; END
BEGIN NOW For where the nearest suburb and the city proper meet END
BEGIN NOW My window-sill is level with the faces in the street -- END
BEGIN NOW Drifting past, drifting past, END
BEGIN NOW To the beat of weary feet -- END
BEGIN NOW While I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street. END
BEGIN NOW And cause I have to sorrow, in a land so young and fair, END
BEGIN NOW To see upon those faces stamped the marks of Want and Care; END
BEGIN NOW I look in vain for traces of the fresh and fair and sweet END
BEGIN NOW In sallow, sunken faces that are drifting through the street -- END
BEGIN NOW Drifting on, drifting on, END
BEGIN NOW To the scrape of restless feet; END
BEGIN NOW I can sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street. END
BEGIN NOW In hours before the dawning dims the starlight in the sky END
BEGIN NOW The wan and weary faces first begin to trickle by, END
BEGIN NOW Increasing as the moments hurry on with morning feet, END
BEGIN NOW Till like a pallid river flow the faces in the street -- END
BEGIN NOW Flowing in, flowing in, END
BEGIN NOW To the beat of hurried feet -- END
BEGIN NOW Ah! I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street. END
BEGIN NOW The human river dwindles when 'tis past the hour of eight, END
BEGIN NOW Its waves go flowing faster in the fear of being late; END
BEGIN NOW But slowly drag the moments, whilst beneath the dust and heat END
BEGIN NOW The city grinds the owners of the faces in the street -- END
BEGIN NOW Grinding body, grinding soul, END
BEGIN NOW Yielding scarce enough to eat -- END
BEGIN NOW Oh! I sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street. END
BEGIN NOW And then the only faces till the sun is sinking down END
BEGIN NOW Are those of outside toilers and the idlers of the town, END
BEGIN NOW Save here and there a face that seems a stranger in the street, END
BEGIN NOW Tells of the city's unemployed upon his weary beat -- END
BEGIN NOW Drifting round, drifting round, END
BEGIN NOW To the tread of listless feet -- END
BEGIN NOW Ah! My heart aches for the owner of that sad face in the street. END
BEGIN NOW And when the hours on lagging feet have slowly dragged away, END
BEGIN NOW And sickly yellow gaslights rise to mock the going day, END
BEGIN NOW Then flowing past my window like a tide in its retreat, END
BEGIN NOW Again I see the pallid stream of faces in the street -- END
BEGIN NOW Ebbing out, ebbing out, END
BEGIN NOW To the drag of tired feet, END
BEGIN NOW Sinking down, sinking down, END
BEGIN NOW Battered wreck by tempests beat -- END
BEGIN NOW A dreadful, thankless trade is hers, that Woman of the Street. END
BEGIN NOW But, ah! to dreader things than these our fair young city comes, END
BEGIN NOW For in its heart are growing thick the filthy dens and slums, END
BEGIN NOW Where human forms shall rot away in sties for swine unmeet, END
BEGIN NOW And ghostly faces shall be seen unfit for any street -- END
BEGIN NOW Rotting out, rotting out, END
BEGIN NOW For the lack of air and meat -- END
BEGIN NOW In dens of vice and horror that are hidden from the street. END
BEGIN NOW I wonder would the apathy of wealthy men endure END
BEGIN NOW Were all their windows level with the faces of the Poor? END
BEGIN NOW The wrong things and the bad things END
BEGIN NOW And the sad things that we meet END
BEGIN NOW In the filthy lane and alley, and the cruel, heartless street. END
BEGIN NOW I left the dreadful corner where the steps are never still, END
BEGIN NOW And sought another window overlooking gorge and hill; END
BEGIN NOW But when the night came dreary with the driving rain and sleet, END
BEGIN NOW They haunted me -- the shadows of those faces in the street, END
BEGIN NOW Flitting by, flitting by, END
BEGIN NOW Flitting by with noiseless feet, END
BEGIN NOW Once I cried: 'Oh, God Almighty! if Thy might doth still endure, END
BEGIN NOW And, lo! with shops all shuttered I beheld a city's street, END
BEGIN NOW And in the warning distance heard the tramp of many feet, END
BEGIN NOW Coming near, coming near, END
BEGIN NOW To a drum's dull distant beat, END
BEGIN NOW And soon I saw the army that was marching down the street. END
BEGIN NOW Then, like a swollen river that has broken bank and wall, END
BEGIN NOW The human flood came pouring with the red flags over all, END
BEGIN NOW And kindled eyes all blazing bright with revolution's heat, END
BEGIN NOW And flashing swords reflecting rigid faces in the street. END
BEGIN NOW Pouring on, pouring on, END
BEGIN NOW To a drum's loud threatening beat, END
BEGIN NOW And the war-hymns and the cheering of the people in the street. END
BEGIN NOW And so it must be while the world goes rolling round its course, END
BEGIN NOW Shall its sad people miss awhile the terrors of the street -- END
BEGIN NOW The dreadful everlasting strife END
BEGIN NOW For scarcely clothes and meat END
BEGIN NOW In that pent track of living death -- the city's cruel street. END
BEGIN NOW The night too quickly passes END
BEGIN NOW And we are growing old, END
BEGIN NOW So let us fill our glasses END
BEGIN NOW And toast the Days of Gold; END
BEGIN NOW When finds of wondrous treasure END
BEGIN NOW Set all the South ablaze, END
BEGIN NOW And you and I were faithful mates END
BEGIN NOW All through the roaring days! END
BEGIN NOW Then stately ships came sailing END
BEGIN NOW From every harbour's mouth, END
BEGIN NOW And sought the land of promise END
BEGIN NOW That beaconed in the South; END
BEGIN NOW Then southward streamed their streamers END
BEGIN NOW And swelled their canvas full END
BEGIN NOW To speed the wildest dreamers END
BEGIN NOW E'er borne in vessel's hull. END
BEGIN NOW Their shining Eldorado, END
BEGIN NOW Beneath the southern skies, END
BEGIN NOW Was day and night for ever END
BEGIN NOW Before their eager eyes. END
BEGIN NOW The brooding bush, awakened, END
BEGIN NOW Was stirred in wild unrest, END
BEGIN NOW And all the year a human stream END
BEGIN NOW Went pouring to the West. END
BEGIN NOW The rough bush roads re-echoed END
BEGIN NOW The bar-room's noisy din, END
BEGIN NOW When troops of stalwart horsemen END
BEGIN NOW Dismounted at the inn. END
BEGIN NOW And oft the hearty greetings END
BEGIN NOW And hearty clasp of hands END
BEGIN NOW Would tell of sudden meetings END
BEGIN NOW Of friends from other lands; END
BEGIN NOW When, puzzled long, the new-chum END
BEGIN NOW Would recognise at last, END
BEGIN NOW Behind a bronzed and bearded skin, END
BEGIN NOW A comrade of the past. END
BEGIN NOW And when the cheery camp-fire END
BEGIN NOW Explored the bush with gleams, END
BEGIN NOW The camping-grounds were crowded END
BEGIN NOW With caravans of teams; END
BEGIN NOW Then home the jests were driven, END
BEGIN NOW And good old songs were sung, END
BEGIN NOW And choruses were given END
BEGIN NOW The strength of heart and lung. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, they were lion-hearted END
BEGIN NOW Who gave our country birth! END
BEGIN NOW Oh, they were of the stoutest sons END
BEGIN NOW From all the lands on earth! END
BEGIN NOW Oft when the camps were dreaming, END
BEGIN NOW And fires began to pale, END
BEGIN NOW Through rugged ranges gleaming END
BEGIN NOW Would come the Royal Mail. END
BEGIN NOW Behind six foaming horses, END
BEGIN NOW And lit by flashing lamps, END
BEGIN NOW Old 'Cobb and Co.'s', in royal state, END
BEGIN NOW Went dashing past the camps. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, who would paint a goldfield, END
BEGIN NOW And limn the picture right, END
BEGIN NOW As we have often seen it END
BEGIN NOW In early morning's light; END
BEGIN NOW The yellow mounds of mullock END
BEGIN NOW With spots of red and white, END
BEGIN NOW The scattered quartz that glistened END
BEGIN NOW Like diamonds in light; END
BEGIN NOW The azure line of ridges, END
BEGIN NOW The bush of darkest green, END
BEGIN NOW The little homes of calico END
BEGIN NOW That dotted all the scene. END
BEGIN NOW I hear the fall of timber END
BEGIN NOW From distant flats and fells, END
BEGIN NOW The pealing of the anvils END
BEGIN NOW As clear as little bells, END
BEGIN NOW The rattle of the cradle, END
BEGIN NOW The clack of windlass-boles, END
BEGIN NOW The flutter of the crimson flags END
BEGIN NOW Above the golden holes. END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW Ah, then our hearts were bolder, END
BEGIN NOW And if Dame Fortune frowned END
BEGIN NOW Our swags we'd lightly shoulder END
BEGIN NOW And tramp to other ground. END
BEGIN NOW But golden days are vanished, END
BEGIN NOW And altered is the scene; END
BEGIN NOW The diggings are deserted, END
BEGIN NOW The camping-grounds are green; END
BEGIN NOW The flaunting flag of progress END
BEGIN NOW Is in the West unfurled, END
BEGIN NOW The mighty bush with iron rails END
BEGIN NOW Is tethered to the world. END
BEGIN NOW It is stuffy in the steerage where the second-classers sleep, END
BEGIN NOW In the cushioned cabins, aft, END
BEGIN NOW With saloons 'n' smoke-rooms, aft -- END
BEGIN NOW There is sheets 'n' best of tucker for the first-salooners, aft. END
BEGIN NOW Our beef is just like scrapin's from the inside of a hide, END
BEGIN NOW Say, cold fowl for luncheon, aft, END
BEGIN NOW Juicy grills an' toast 'n' cutlets -- tucker a-lor-frongsy, aft. END
BEGIN NOW They feed our women sep'rate, an' they make a blessed fuss, END
BEGIN NOW Just as if they couldn't trust 'em for to eat along with us! END
BEGIN NOW With their ferns an' mirrors, aft, END
BEGIN NOW With their flow'rs an' napkins, aft -- END
BEGIN NOW 'I'll assist you to an orange' -- 'Kindly pass the sugar', aft. END
BEGIN NOW We are shabby, rough, 'n' dirty, an' our feelin's out of tune, END
BEGIN NOW An' it's hard on fellers for'ard that was used to go saloon; END
BEGIN NOW For they'd understand him, aft, END
BEGIN NOW (He will miss the bath-rooms aft), END
BEGIN NOW Spite of all there's no denyin' that there's finer feelin's aft. END
BEGIN NOW With his cap an' spyglass, aft -- END
BEGIN NOW A careless, rovin', gay young spark as always travelled aft. END
BEGIN NOW There's a notice by the gangway, an' it seems to come amiss, END
BEGIN NOW For it says that second-classers 'ain't allowed abaft o' this'; END
BEGIN NOW An' there ought to be a notice for the fellows from abaft -- END
BEGIN NOW But the smell an' dirt's a warnin' to the first-salooners, aft; END
BEGIN NOW With their tooth and nail-brush, aft, END
BEGIN NOW With their cuffs 'n' collars, aft -- END
BEGIN NOW I want to breathe the mornin' breeze that blows against the boat, END
BEGIN NOW With their dressin'-cases, aft, END
BEGIN NOW With their swell pyjamas, aft -- END
BEGIN NOW Yes! the idle and the careless, they have ease an' comfort, aft. END
BEGIN NOW I feel so low an' wretched, as I mooch about the deck, END
BEGIN NOW That I'm ripe for jumpin' over -- an' I wish there was a wreck! END
BEGIN NOW We are driven to New Zealand to be shot out over there -- END
BEGIN NOW Scarce a shillin' in our pockets, nor a decent rag to wear, END
BEGIN NOW With the everlastin' worry lest we don't get into graft -- END
BEGIN NOW There is little left to land for if you cannot travel aft; END
BEGIN NOW No anxiety abaft, END
BEGIN NOW They have stuff to land with, aft -- END
BEGIN NOW Oh, there's little left to land for if you cannot travel aft; END
BEGIN NOW But it's grand at sea this mornin', an' Creation almost speaks, END
BEGIN NOW Sailin' past the Bay of Islands with its pinnacles an' peaks, END
BEGIN NOW With the sunny haze all round us an' the white-caps on the blue, END
BEGIN NOW An' we see the beauty for'ard, better than if we were aft; END
BEGIN NOW Spite of op'ra-glasses, aft; END
BEGIN NOW But, ah well, they're brothers aft -- END
BEGIN NOW Nature seems to draw us closer -- bring us nearer fore-'n'-aft. END
BEGIN NOW What's the use of bein' bitter? What's the use of gettin' mad? END
BEGIN NOW What's the use of bein' narrer just because yer luck is bad? END
BEGIN NOW We are used to bein' shabby -- we have got no overdraft -- END
BEGIN NOW We can laugh at troubles for'ard that they couldn't laugh at aft; END
BEGIN NOW (Keepin' up appearance, aft) END
BEGIN NOW There's anxiety an' worry in the breezy cabins aft. END
BEGIN NOW There'll be higher education for the toilin' starvin' clown, END
BEGIN NOW An' the rich an' educated shall be educated down; END
BEGIN NOW An' we all will meet amidships on this stout old earthly craft, END
BEGIN NOW An' there won't be any friction 'twixt the classes fore-'n'-aft. END
BEGIN NOW We'll be brothers, fore-'n'-aft! END
BEGIN NOW When the people work together, and there ain't no fore-'n'-aft. END
BEGIN NOW The Drover's Sweetheart END
BEGIN NOW An hour before the sun goes down END
BEGIN NOW Behind the ragged boughs, END
BEGIN NOW I go across the little run END
BEGIN NOW And bring the dusty cows; END
BEGIN NOW And once I used to sit and rest END
BEGIN NOW Beneath the fading dome, END
BEGIN NOW For there was one that I loved best END
BEGIN NOW Who'd bring the cattle home. END
BEGIN NOW Our yard is fixed with double bails, END
BEGIN NOW Round one the grass is green, END
BEGIN NOW The bush is growing through the rails, END
BEGIN NOW The spike is rusted in; END
BEGIN NOW And 'twas from there his freckled face END
BEGIN NOW Would turn and smile at me -- END
BEGIN NOW He'd milk a dozen in the race END
BEGIN NOW While I was milking three. END
BEGIN NOW I milk eleven cows myself END
BEGIN NOW Where once I milked but four; END
BEGIN NOW I set the dishes on the shelf END
BEGIN NOW And close the dairy door; END
BEGIN NOW And when the glaring sunlight fails END
BEGIN NOW And the fire shines through the cracks, END
BEGIN NOW I climb the broken stockyard rails END
BEGIN NOW And watch the bridle-tracks. END
BEGIN NOW He kissed me twice and once again END
BEGIN NOW And rode across the hill, END
BEGIN NOW The pint-pots and the hobble-chain END
BEGIN NOW I hear them jingling still; END
BEGIN NOW He'll come at night or not at all -- END
BEGIN NOW He left in dust and heat, END
BEGIN NOW And when the soft, cool shadows fall END
BEGIN NOW Is the best time to meet. END
BEGIN NOW And he is coming back again, END
BEGIN NOW He wrote to let me know, END
BEGIN NOW The floods were in the Darling then -- END
BEGIN NOW It seems so long ago; END
BEGIN NOW He'd come through miles of slush and mud, END
BEGIN NOW And it was weary work, END
BEGIN NOW The creeks were bankers, and the flood END
BEGIN NOW Was forty miles round Bourke. END
BEGIN NOW He said the floods had formed a block, END
BEGIN NOW The plains could not be crossed, END
BEGIN NOW And there was foot-rot in the flock END
BEGIN NOW And hundreds had been lost; END
BEGIN NOW The sheep were falling thick and fast END
BEGIN NOW A hundred miles from town, END
BEGIN NOW And when he reached the line at last END
BEGIN NOW He trucked the remnant down. END
BEGIN NOW And so he'll have to stand the cost; END
BEGIN NOW His luck was always bad, END
BEGIN NOW Instead of making more, he lost END
BEGIN NOW The money that he had; END
BEGIN NOW And how he'll manage, heaven knows END
BEGIN NOW (My eyes are getting dim), END
BEGIN NOW He says -- he says -- he don't -- suppose END
BEGIN NOW As if I wouldn't take his hand END
BEGIN NOW Without a golden glove -- END
BEGIN NOW Oh! Jack, you men won't understand END
BEGIN NOW How much a girl can love. END
BEGIN NOW I long to see his face once more -- END
BEGIN NOW Jack's dog! thank God, it's Jack! -- END
BEGIN NOW (I never thought I'd faint before) END
BEGIN NOW He's coming -- up -- the track. END
BEGIN NOW and the sheds were all cut out; END
BEGIN NOW The publican's words were short and few, END
BEGIN NOW and the publican's looks were black -- END
BEGIN NOW For time means tucker, and tramp you must, END
BEGIN NOW where the scrubs and plains are wide, END
BEGIN NOW they carry their swags Out Back. END
BEGIN NOW though he tramped for a year Out Back. END
BEGIN NOW In stifling noons when his back was wrung END
BEGIN NOW by its load, and the air seemed dead, END
BEGIN NOW and the scrubs were cold and black, END
BEGIN NOW He blamed himself in the year 'Too Late' -- END
BEGIN NOW in the heaviest hours of life -- END
BEGIN NOW and treacherous tongues attack -- END
BEGIN NOW It chanced one day, when the north wind blew END
BEGIN NOW in his face like a furnace-breath, END
BEGIN NOW A drover came, but the fringe of law was eastward many a mile; END
BEGIN NOW by his mouldering swag Out Back. END
BEGIN NOW _For time means tucker, and tramp they must, END
BEGIN NOW where the plains and scrubs are wide, END
BEGIN NOW With stinted stomachs and blistered feet END
BEGIN NOW must carry their swags Out Back._ END
BEGIN NOW The Free-Selector's Daughter END
BEGIN NOW A darling girl I thought her, END
BEGIN NOW And ere I left I swore I'd win END
BEGIN NOW The free-selector's daughter. END
BEGIN NOW I milked her father's cows a month, END
BEGIN NOW I brought the wood and water, END
BEGIN NOW I mended all the broken fence, END
BEGIN NOW Before I won the daughter. END
BEGIN NOW I listened to her father's yarns, END
BEGIN NOW I did just what I 'oughter', END
BEGIN NOW And what you'll have to do to win END
BEGIN NOW A free-selector's daughter. END
BEGIN NOW I broke my pipe and burnt my twist, END
BEGIN NOW And washed my mouth with water; END
BEGIN NOW I had a shave before I kissed END
BEGIN NOW The free-selector's daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Then, rising in the frosty morn, END
BEGIN NOW I brought the cows for Mary, END
BEGIN NOW And when I'd milked a bucketful END
BEGIN NOW I took it to the dairy. END
BEGIN NOW I poured the milk into the dish END
BEGIN NOW While Mary held the strainer, END
BEGIN NOW I summoned heart to speak my wish, END
BEGIN NOW And, oh! her blush grew plainer. END
BEGIN NOW I told her I must leave the place, END
BEGIN NOW I said that I would miss her; END
BEGIN NOW At first she turned away her face, END
BEGIN NOW And then she let me kiss her. END
BEGIN NOW I put the bucket on the ground, END
BEGIN NOW And in my arms I caught her: END
BEGIN NOW I'd give the world to hold again END
BEGIN NOW That free-selector's daughter! END
BEGIN NOW When you're camping in the mulga, and the rain is falling slow, END
BEGIN NOW While you nurse your rheumatism 'neath a patch of calico; END
BEGIN NOW Short of tucker or tobacco, short of sugar or of tea, END
BEGIN NOW For it cannot last for ever -- 'I will rise again!' says you. END
BEGIN NOW When you're dossing out in winter, in the darkness and the rain, END
BEGIN NOW Who are ye? Come, move on -- git out av this!' END
BEGIN NOW But it can't go on for ever -- 'I'll have money yet!' says you. END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW Bother not about the morrow, for sufficient to the day END
BEGIN NOW Is the evil (rather more so). Put your trust in God and pray! END
BEGIN NOW Study well the ant, thou sluggard. Blessed are the meek and low. END
BEGIN NOW Andy's Gone With Cattle END
BEGIN NOW Our Andy's gone to battle now END
BEGIN NOW 'Gainst Drought, the red marauder; END
BEGIN NOW Our Andy's gone with cattle now END
BEGIN NOW Across the Queensland border. END
BEGIN NOW He's left us in dejection now; END
BEGIN NOW Our hearts with him are roving. END
BEGIN NOW It's dull on this selection now, END
BEGIN NOW Since Andy went a-droving. END
BEGIN NOW Who now shall wear the cheerful face END
BEGIN NOW In times when things are slackest? END
BEGIN NOW And who shall whistle round the place END
BEGIN NOW When Fortune frowns her blackest? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, who shall cheek the squatter now END
BEGIN NOW When he comes round us snarling? END
BEGIN NOW His tongue is growing hotter now END
BEGIN NOW Since Andy cross'd the Darling. END
BEGIN NOW The gates are out of order now, END
BEGIN NOW In storms the 'riders' rattle; END
BEGIN NOW For far across the border now END
BEGIN NOW Our Andy's gone with cattle. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Aunty's looking thin and white; END
BEGIN NOW And Uncle's cross with worry; END
BEGIN NOW And poor old Blucher howls all night END
BEGIN NOW Since Andy left Macquarie. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, may the showers in torrents fall, END
BEGIN NOW And all the tanks run over; END
BEGIN NOW And may the grass grow green and tall END
BEGIN NOW In pathways of the drover; END
BEGIN NOW And may good angels send the rain END
BEGIN NOW On desert stretches sandy; END
BEGIN NOW And when the summer comes again END
BEGIN NOW God grant 'twill bring us Andy. END
BEGIN NOW It chanced upon the very day we'd got the shearing done, END
BEGIN NOW A buggy brought a stranger to the West-o'-Sunday Run; END
BEGIN NOW He had a round and jolly face, and he was sleek and stout, END
BEGIN NOW He drove right up between the huts and called the super out. END
BEGIN NOW We chaps were smoking after tea, and heard the swell enquire END
BEGIN NOW For one as travelled by the name of 'Dunn of Nevertire'. END
BEGIN NOW There wasn't one of us but knew Jack Dunn of Nevertire. END
BEGIN NOW 'Jack Dunn of Nevertire,' he said; 'I was a mate of his; END
BEGIN NOW And now it's twenty years since I set eyes upon his phiz. END
BEGIN NOW There is no whiter man than Jack -- no straighter south the line, END
BEGIN NOW To help a mate in trouble Jack would go through flood and fire. END
BEGIN NOW Great Scott! and don't you know the name of Dunn of Nevertire? END
BEGIN NOW Long Jack from Nevertire; END
BEGIN NOW He stuck to me through thick and thin, Jack Dunn of Nevertire. END
BEGIN NOW 'I did a wild and foolish thing while Jack and I were mates, END
BEGIN NOW And I disgraced my guv'nor's name, an' wished to try the States. END
BEGIN NOW My lamps were turned to Yankee Land, for I'd some people there, END
BEGIN NOW And I was right when someone sent the money for my fare; END
BEGIN NOW I thought 'twas Dad until I took the trouble to enquire, END
BEGIN NOW And found that he who sent the stuff was Dunn of Nevertire, END
BEGIN NOW He'd won some money on a race -- Jack Dunn of Nevertire. END
BEGIN NOW 'Now I've returned, by Liverpool, a swell of Yankee brand, END
BEGIN NOW To reckon, guess, and kalkilate, 'n' wake my native land; END
BEGIN NOW There is no better land, I swear, in all the wide world round -- END
BEGIN NOW I smelt the bush a month before we touched King George's Sound! END
BEGIN NOW And now I've come to settle down, the top of my desire END
BEGIN NOW Is just to meet a mate o' mine called 'Dunn of Nevertire'. END
BEGIN NOW Was raised at Nevertire -- END
BEGIN NOW The town of Nevertire; END
BEGIN NOW He humped his bluey by the name of 'Dunn of Nevertire'. END
BEGIN NOW 'I've heard he's poor, and if he is, a proud old fool is he; END
BEGIN NOW But, spite of that, I'll find a way to fix the old gum-tree. END
BEGIN NOW I've bought a station in the North -- the best that could be had; END
BEGIN NOW I want no bully-brute to boss -- no crawling, sneaking liar -- END
BEGIN NOW My station super's name shall be 'Jack Dunn of Nevertire'! END
BEGIN NOW I guess he's known up Queensland way -- Jack Dunn of Nevertire.' END
BEGIN NOW The super said, while to his face a strange expression came: END
BEGIN NOW 'I THINK I've seen the man you want, I THINK I know the name; END
BEGIN NOW Had he a jolly kind of face, a free and careless way, END
BEGIN NOW Jack D. from Nevertire, END
BEGIN NOW They said I'd find him here, the cuss! -- Jack Dunn of Nevertire. END
BEGIN NOW 'I doubt it much,' the super said, and sadly puffed his briar, END
BEGIN NOW 'I guess he wears a pair of wings -- Jack Dunn of Nevertire; END
BEGIN NOW He caught a fever nursing me, Jack Dunn of Nevertire.' END
BEGIN NOW We took the stranger round to where a gum-tree stood alone, END
BEGIN NOW And in the grass beside the trunk he saw a granite stone; END
BEGIN NOW The names of Dunn and Nevertire were plainly written there -- END
BEGIN NOW 'I'm all broke up,' the stranger said, in sorrow and despair, END
BEGIN NOW 'I guess he has a wider run, the man that I require; END
BEGIN NOW He's got a river-frontage now, Jack Dunn of Nevertire; END
BEGIN NOW White Jack from Nevertire, END
BEGIN NOW I guess Saint Peter knew the name of 'Dunn of Nevertire'.' END
BEGIN NOW Rode out to Blackman's Run, END
BEGIN NOW His cap-peak and his sabre END
BEGIN NOW Were glancing in the sun. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas New Year's Eve, and slowly END
BEGIN NOW Across the ridges low END
BEGIN NOW The sad Old Year was drifting END
BEGIN NOW To where the old years go. END
BEGIN NOW The trooper's mind was reading END
BEGIN NOW The love-page of his life -- END
BEGIN NOW His love for Mary Wylie END
BEGIN NOW Ere she was Blackman's wife; END
BEGIN NOW He sorrowed for the sorrows END
BEGIN NOW Of the heart a rival won, END
BEGIN NOW For he knew that there was trouble END
BEGIN NOW Out there on Blackman's Run. END
BEGIN NOW The sapling shades had lengthened, END
BEGIN NOW The summer day was late, END
BEGIN NOW When Blackman met the trooper END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the homestead gate. END
BEGIN NOW And if the hand of trouble END
BEGIN NOW Can leave a lasting trace, END
BEGIN NOW The lines of care had come to stay END
BEGIN NOW On poor old Blackman's face. END
BEGIN NOW 'Not good day, Trooper Campbell, END
BEGIN NOW It's a bad, bad day for me -- END
BEGIN NOW You are of all the men on earth END
BEGIN NOW The one I wished to see. END
BEGIN NOW The great black clouds of trouble END
BEGIN NOW Above our homestead hang; END
BEGIN NOW That wild and reckless boy of mine END
BEGIN NOW Has joined M'Durmer's gang. END
BEGIN NOW 'Oh! save him, save him, Campbell! END
BEGIN NOW I beg in friendship's name! END
BEGIN NOW For if they take and hang him, END
BEGIN NOW The wife would die of shame. END
BEGIN NOW Could Mary or her sisters END
BEGIN NOW Hold up their heads again, END
BEGIN NOW And face a woman's malice END
BEGIN NOW Or claim the love of men? END
BEGIN NOW 'And if he does a murder END
BEGIN NOW 'Twere better we were dead. END
BEGIN NOW Don't take him, Trooper Campbell, END
BEGIN NOW If a price be on his head; END
BEGIN NOW But shoot him! shoot him, Campbell, END
BEGIN NOW When you meet him face to face, END
BEGIN NOW And save him from the gallows, END
BEGIN NOW And us from that disgrace.' END
BEGIN NOW 'Now, Tom,' cried Trooper Campbell, END
BEGIN NOW 'You know your words are wild. END
BEGIN NOW Though he is wild and reckless, END
BEGIN NOW Yet still he is your child; END
BEGIN NOW So bear up in your trouble, END
BEGIN NOW And meet it like a man, END
BEGIN NOW And tell the wife and daughters END
BEGIN NOW I'll save him if I can.' END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW The sad Australian sunset END
BEGIN NOW Had faded from the west; END
BEGIN NOW But night brings darker shadows END
BEGIN NOW To hearts that cannot rest; END
BEGIN NOW And Blackman's wife sat rocking END
BEGIN NOW And moaning in her chair. END
BEGIN NOW 'I cannot bear disgrace,' she moaned; END
BEGIN NOW 'Disgrace I cannot bear. END
BEGIN NOW 'In hardship and in trouble END
BEGIN NOW I struggled year by year END
BEGIN NOW To make my children better END
BEGIN NOW Than other children here. END
BEGIN NOW And if my son's a felon END
BEGIN NOW How can I show my face? END
BEGIN NOW I cannot bear disgrace; my God, END
BEGIN NOW I cannot bear disgrace! END
BEGIN NOW 'Ah, God in Heaven pardon! END
BEGIN NOW I'm selfish in my woe -- END
BEGIN NOW My boy is better-hearted END
BEGIN NOW Than many that I know. END
BEGIN NOW And I will face the world's disgrace, END
BEGIN NOW And, till his mother's dead, END
BEGIN NOW My foolish child shall find a place END
BEGIN NOW To lay his outlawed head.' END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW With a sad heart Trooper Campbell END
BEGIN NOW Rode back from Blackman's Run, END
BEGIN NOW Nor noticed aught about him END
BEGIN NOW Till thirteen miles were done; END
BEGIN NOW When, close beside a cutting, END
BEGIN NOW He heard the click of locks, END
BEGIN NOW And saw the rifle muzzles END
BEGIN NOW Were on him from the rocks. END
BEGIN NOW But suddenly a youth rode out, END
BEGIN NOW And, close by Campbell's side: END
BEGIN NOW 'Don't fire! don't fire, in heaven's name! END
BEGIN NOW It's Campbell, boys!' he cried. END
BEGIN NOW Then one by one in silence END
BEGIN NOW The levelled rifles fell, END
BEGIN NOW For who'd shoot Trooper Campbell END
BEGIN NOW Of those who knew him well? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, bravely sat old Campbell, END
BEGIN NOW No sign of fear showed he. END
BEGIN NOW He slowly drew his carbine; END
BEGIN NOW It rested by his knee. END
BEGIN NOW The outlaws' guns were lifted, END
BEGIN NOW But none the silence broke, END
BEGIN NOW Till steadfastly and firmly END
BEGIN NOW Old Trooper Campbell spoke. END
BEGIN NOW 'That boy that you would ruin END
BEGIN NOW Goes home with me, my men; END
BEGIN NOW Or some of us shall never END
BEGIN NOW Ride through the Gap again. END
BEGIN NOW You know old Trooper Campbell, END
BEGIN NOW And have you ever heard END
BEGIN NOW That bluff or lead could turn him, END
BEGIN NOW That e'er he broke his word? END
BEGIN NOW 'That reckless lad is playing END
BEGIN NOW A heartless villain's part; END
BEGIN NOW He knows that he is breaking END
BEGIN NOW His poor old mother's heart. END
BEGIN NOW He'll bring a curse upon himself; END
BEGIN NOW But 'tis not that alone, END
BEGIN NOW He'll bring dishonour to a name END
BEGIN NOW That I'D be proud to own. END
BEGIN NOW 'I speak to you, M'Durmer, -- END
BEGIN NOW If your heart's not hardened quite, END
BEGIN NOW And if you'd seen the trouble END
BEGIN NOW At Blackman's home this night, END
BEGIN NOW You'd help me now, M'Durmer -- END
BEGIN NOW I speak as man to man -- END
BEGIN NOW I swore to save that foolish lad, END
BEGIN NOW And I'll save him if I can.' END
BEGIN NOW 'Oh, take him!' said M'Durmer, END
BEGIN NOW 'He's got a horse to ride.' END
BEGIN NOW The youngster thought a moment, END
BEGIN NOW Then rode to Campbell's side -- END
BEGIN NOW 'Good-bye!' the outlaws shouted, END
BEGIN NOW As up the range they sped. END
BEGIN NOW Was all M'Durmer said. END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW Then fast along the ridges END
BEGIN NOW Two bushmen rode a race, END
BEGIN NOW And the moonlight lent a glory END
BEGIN NOW To Trooper Campbell's face. END
BEGIN NOW And ere the new year's dawning END
BEGIN NOW They reached the home at last; END
BEGIN NOW And this is but a story END
BEGIN NOW Of trouble that is past! END
BEGIN NOW The colours of the setting sun END
BEGIN NOW Withdrew across the Western land -- END
BEGIN NOW He raised the sliprails, one by one, END
BEGIN NOW And shot them home with trembling hand; END
BEGIN NOW Her brown hands clung -- her face grew pale -- END
BEGIN NOW Ah! quivering chin and eyes that brim! -- END
BEGIN NOW One quick, fierce kiss across the rail, END
BEGIN NOW _Oh, he rides hard to race the pain END
BEGIN NOW Who rides from love, who rides from home; END
BEGIN NOW But he rides slowly home again, END
BEGIN NOW Whose heart has learnt to love and roam._ END
BEGIN NOW A hand upon the horse's mane, END
BEGIN NOW And one foot in the stirrup set, END
BEGIN NOW And, stooping back to kiss again, END
BEGIN NOW With 'Good-bye, Mary! don't you fret! END
BEGIN NOW When I come back' -- he laughed for her -- END
BEGIN NOW 'We do not know how soon 'twill be; END
BEGIN NOW I'll whistle as I round the spur -- END
BEGIN NOW You let the sliprails down for me.' END
BEGIN NOW She gasped for sudden loss of hope, END
BEGIN NOW As, with a backward wave to her, END
BEGIN NOW He cantered down the grassy slope END
BEGIN NOW And swiftly round the dark'ning spur. END
BEGIN NOW Black-pencilled panels standing high, END
BEGIN NOW And darkness fading into stars, END
BEGIN NOW And blurring fast against the sky, END
BEGIN NOW A faint white form beside the bars. END
BEGIN NOW And often at the set of sun, END
BEGIN NOW In winter bleak and summer brown, END
BEGIN NOW She'd steal across the little run, END
BEGIN NOW And shyly let the sliprails down. END
BEGIN NOW And listen there when darkness shut END
BEGIN NOW The nearer spur in silence deep; END
BEGIN NOW And when they called her from the hut END
BEGIN NOW Steal home and cry herself to sleep. END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW {Some editions have four more lines here.} END
BEGIN NOW _And he rides hard to dull the pain END
BEGIN NOW Who rides from one that loves him best; END
BEGIN NOW And he rides slowly back again, END
BEGIN NOW Whose restless heart must rove for rest._ END
BEGIN NOW Now up and down the siding brown END
BEGIN NOW The great black crows are flyin', END
BEGIN NOW And down below the spur, I know, END
BEGIN NOW Another 'milker's' dyin'; END
BEGIN NOW The crops have withered from the ground, END
BEGIN NOW The tank's clay bed is glarin', END
BEGIN NOW But from my heart no tear nor sound, END
BEGIN NOW For I have gone past carin' -- END
BEGIN NOW _Past worryin' or carin', END
BEGIN NOW Past feelin' aught or carin'; END
BEGIN NOW But from my heart no tear nor sound, END
BEGIN NOW For I have gone past carin'._ END
BEGIN NOW Through Death and Trouble, turn about, END
BEGIN NOW Through hopeless desolation, END
BEGIN NOW Through flood and fever, fire and drought, END
BEGIN NOW And slavery and starvation; END
BEGIN NOW Through childbirth, sickness, hurt, and blight, END
BEGIN NOW And nervousness an' scarin', END
BEGIN NOW Through bein' left alone at night, END
BEGIN NOW I've got to be past carin'. END
BEGIN NOW _Past botherin' or carin', END
BEGIN NOW Past feelin' and past carin'; END
BEGIN NOW Through city cheats and neighbours' spite, END
BEGIN NOW I've come to be past carin'._ END
BEGIN NOW Our first child took, in days like these, END
BEGIN NOW A cruel week in dyin', END
BEGIN NOW All day upon her father's knees, END
BEGIN NOW Or on my poor breast lyin'; END
BEGIN NOW The tears we shed -- the prayers we said END
BEGIN NOW Were awful, wild -- despairin'! END
BEGIN NOW I've pulled three through, and buried two END
BEGIN NOW Since then -- and I'm past carin'. END
BEGIN NOW _I've grown to be past carin', END
BEGIN NOW Past worryin' and wearin'; END
BEGIN NOW I've pulled three through and buried two END
BEGIN NOW Since then, and I'm past carin'._ END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas ten years first, then came the worst, END
BEGIN NOW All for a dusty clearin', END
BEGIN NOW I thought, I thought my heart would burst END
BEGIN NOW When first my man went shearin'; END
BEGIN NOW He's drovin' in the great North-west, END
BEGIN NOW I don't know how he's farin'; END
BEGIN NOW For I, the one that loved him best, END
BEGIN NOW Have grown to be past carin'. END
BEGIN NOW _I've grown to be past carin' END
BEGIN NOW Past lookin' for or carin'; END
BEGIN NOW The girl that waited long ago, END
BEGIN NOW Has lived to be past carin'._ END
BEGIN NOW My eyes are dry, I cannot cry, END
BEGIN NOW I've got no heart for breakin', END
BEGIN NOW But where it was in days gone by, END
BEGIN NOW A dull and empty achin'. END
BEGIN NOW My last boy ran away from me, END
BEGIN NOW I know my temper's wearin', END
BEGIN NOW But now I only wish to be END
BEGIN NOW Beyond all signs of carin'. END
BEGIN NOW _Past wearyin' or carin', END
BEGIN NOW Past feelin' and despairin'; END
BEGIN NOW And now I only wish to be END
BEGIN NOW Beyond all signs of carin'._ END
BEGIN NOW Three bushmen one morning rode up to an inn, END
BEGIN NOW And one of them called for the drinks with a grin; END
BEGIN NOW They'd only returned from a trip to the North, END
BEGIN NOW And, eager to greet them, the landlord came forth. END
BEGIN NOW He absently poured out a glass of Three Star. END
BEGIN NOW And set down that drink with the rest on the bar. END
BEGIN NOW 'There, that is for Harry,' he said, 'and it's queer, END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis the very same glass that he drank from last year; END
BEGIN NOW His name's on the glass, you can read it like print, END
BEGIN NOW He scratched it himself with an old piece of flint; END
BEGIN NOW I remember his drink -- it was always Three Star' -- END
BEGIN NOW And the landlord looked out through the door of the bar. END
BEGIN NOW He looked at the horses, and counted but three: END
BEGIN NOW 'You were always together -- where's Harry?' cried he. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, sadly they looked at the glass as they said, END
BEGIN NOW 'You may put it away, for our old mate is dead;' END
BEGIN NOW But one, gazing out o'er the ridges afar, END
BEGIN NOW Said, 'We owe him a shout -- leave the glass on the bar.' END
BEGIN NOW They thought of the far-away grave on the plain, END
BEGIN NOW They thought of the comrade who came not again, END
BEGIN NOW They lifted their glasses, and sadly they said: END
BEGIN NOW 'We drink to the name of the mate who is dead.' END
BEGIN NOW And the sunlight streamed in, and a light like a star END
BEGIN NOW Seemed to glow in the depth of the glass on the bar. END
BEGIN NOW And still in that shanty a tumbler is seen, END
BEGIN NOW It stands by the clock, ever polished and clean; END
BEGIN NOW And often the strangers will read as they pass END
BEGIN NOW The name of a bushman engraved on the glass; END
BEGIN NOW And though on the shelf but a dozen there are, END
BEGIN NOW That glass never stands with the rest on the bar. END
BEGIN NOW When the caravans of wool-teams climbed the ranges from the West, END
BEGIN NOW It was built of bark and saplings, and was rather rough inside, END
BEGIN NOW As the bushmen called the landlord of the Shanty on the Rise. END
BEGIN NOW City swells who 'do the Royal' would have called the Shanty low, END
BEGIN NOW But 'twas better far and purer than some toney pubs I know; END
BEGIN NOW For the patrons of the Shanty had the principles of men, END
BEGIN NOW And the spieler, if he struck it, wasn't welcome there again. END
BEGIN NOW You could smoke and drink in quiet, yarn, or else soliloquise, END
BEGIN NOW With a decent lot of fellows in the Shanty on the Rise. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas the bullock-driver's haven when his team was on the road, END
BEGIN NOW Just to camp within a cooey of the Shanty for the night; END
BEGIN NOW And the bullock-bells were clanking from the marshes on the flats END
BEGIN NOW And we took a drop of something that was brought at our desire, END
BEGIN NOW As we stood with steaming moleskins in the kitchen by the fire. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! it roared upon a fireplace of the good, old-fashioned size, END
BEGIN NOW When the rain came down the chimney of the Shanty on the Rise. END
BEGIN NOW They got up a Christmas party in the Shanty long ago, END
BEGIN NOW While I camped with Jimmy Nowlett on the riverbank below; END
BEGIN NOW Poor old Jim was in his glory -- they'd elected him M.C., END
BEGIN NOW 'Mr. Nowlett, Mr. Swaller!' shouted Something-in-Disguise, END
BEGIN NOW As we walked into the parlour of the Shanty on the Rise. END
BEGIN NOW There is little real pleasure in the city where I am -- END
BEGIN NOW There's a swarry round the corner with its mockery and sham; END
BEGIN NOW But a fellow can be happy when around the room he whirls END
BEGIN NOW In a party up the country with the jolly country girls. END
BEGIN NOW Why, at times I almost fancied I was dancing on the skies, END
BEGIN NOW When I danced with Mary Carey in the Shanty on the Rise. END
BEGIN NOW Jimmy came to me and whispered, and I muttered, 'Go along!' END
BEGIN NOW But he shouted, 'Mr. Swaller will oblige us with a song!' END
BEGIN NOW And at first I said I wouldn't, and I shammed a little too, END
BEGIN NOW Till the girls began to whisper, 'Mr. Swallow, now, ah, DO!' END
BEGIN NOW So I sang a song of something 'bout the love that never dies, END
BEGIN NOW And the chorus shook the rafters of the Shanty on the Rise. END
BEGIN NOW Jimmy burst his concertina, and the bullock-drivers went END
BEGIN NOW For the corpse of Joe the Fiddler, who was sleeping in his tent; END
BEGIN NOW Joe was tired and had lumbago, and he wouldn't come, he said, END
BEGIN NOW But the case was very urgent, so they pulled him out of bed; END
BEGIN NOW Jim and I were rather quiet while escorting Mary home, END
BEGIN NOW That we heard the settlers'-matches rustle softly on the tree; END
BEGIN NOW I suppose the Shanty vanished from the ranges long ago, END
BEGIN NOW And the girls are mostly married to the chaps I used to know; END
BEGIN NOW And, upon the very centre of the greenest spot that lies END
BEGIN NOW In my fondest recollection, stands the Shanty on the Rise. END
BEGIN NOW White handkerchiefs wave from the short black pier END
BEGIN NOW As we glide to the grand old sea -- END
BEGIN NOW But the song of my heart is for none to hear END
BEGIN NOW If one of them waves for me. END
BEGIN NOW A roving, roaming life is mine, END
BEGIN NOW Ever by field or flood -- END
BEGIN NOW For not far back in my father's line END
BEGIN NOW Was a dash of the Gipsy blood. END
BEGIN NOW Flax and tussock and fern, END
BEGIN NOW Gum and mulga and sand, END
BEGIN NOW Reef and palm -- but my fancies turn END
BEGIN NOW Ever away from land; END
BEGIN NOW Strange wild cities in ancient state, END
BEGIN NOW Range and river and tree, END
BEGIN NOW Snow and ice. But my star of fate END
BEGIN NOW Is ever across the sea. END
BEGIN NOW A god-like ride on a thundering sea, END
BEGIN NOW When all but the stars are blind -- END
BEGIN NOW A desperate race from Eternity END
BEGIN NOW With a gale-and-a-half behind. END
BEGIN NOW A jovial spree in the cabin at night, END
BEGIN NOW A song on the rolling deck, END
BEGIN NOW A lark ashore with the ships in sight, END
BEGIN NOW Till -- a wreck goes down with a wreck. END
BEGIN NOW A smoke and a yarn on the deck by day, END
BEGIN NOW When life is a waking dream, END
BEGIN NOW And care and trouble so far away END
BEGIN NOW That out of your life they seem. END
BEGIN NOW A roving spirit in sympathy, END
BEGIN NOW Who has travelled the whole world o'er -- END
BEGIN NOW My heart forgets, in a week at sea, END
BEGIN NOW The trouble of years on shore. END
BEGIN NOW A rolling stone! -- 'tis a saw for slaves -- END
BEGIN NOW Philosophy false as old -- END
BEGIN NOW Wear out or break 'neath the feet of knaves, END
BEGIN NOW Or rot in your bed of mould! END
BEGIN NOW But I'D rather trust to the darkest skies END
BEGIN NOW And the wildest seas that roar, END
BEGIN NOW Or die, where the stars of Nations rise, END
BEGIN NOW In the stormy clouds of war. END
BEGIN NOW Cleave to your country, home, and friends, END
BEGIN NOW Die in a sordid strife -- END
BEGIN NOW You can count your friends on your finger ends END
BEGIN NOW In the critical hours of life. END
BEGIN NOW Sacrifice all for the family's sake, END
BEGIN NOW Bow to their selfish rule! END
BEGIN NOW Slave till your big soft heart they break -- END
BEGIN NOW The heart of the family fool. END
BEGIN NOW Domestic quarrels, and family spite, END
BEGIN NOW And your Native Land may be END
BEGIN NOW Controlled by custom, but, come what might, END
BEGIN NOW The rest of the world for me. END
BEGIN NOW I'd sail with money, or sail without! -- END
BEGIN NOW If your love be forced from home, END
BEGIN NOW And you dare enough, and your heart be stout, END
BEGIN NOW The world is your own to roam. END
BEGIN NOW I've never a love that can sting my pride, END
BEGIN NOW Nor a friend to prove untrue; END
BEGIN NOW For I leave my love ere the turning tide, END
BEGIN NOW And my friends are all too new. END
BEGIN NOW The curse of the Powers on a peace like ours, END
BEGIN NOW With its greed and its treachery -- END
BEGIN NOW A stranger's hand, and a stranger land, END
BEGIN NOW And the rest of the world for me! END
BEGIN NOW But why be bitter? The world is cold END
BEGIN NOW To one with a frozen heart; END
BEGIN NOW New friends are often so like the old, END
BEGIN NOW They seem of the past a part -- END
BEGIN NOW As a better part of the past appears, END
BEGIN NOW When enemies, parted long, END
BEGIN NOW Are come together in kinder years, END
BEGIN NOW With their better nature strong. END
BEGIN NOW I had a friend, ere my first ship sailed, END
BEGIN NOW A friend that I never deserved -- END
BEGIN NOW For the selfish strain in my blood prevailed END
BEGIN NOW As soon as my turn was served. END
BEGIN NOW And the memory haunts my heart with shame -- END
BEGIN NOW Or, rather, the pride that's there; END
BEGIN NOW In different guises, but soul the same, END
BEGIN NOW I meet him everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW I had a chum. When the times were tight END
BEGIN NOW We starved in Australian scrubs; END
BEGIN NOW We froze together in parks at night, END
BEGIN NOW And laughed together in pubs. END
BEGIN NOW And I often hear a laugh like his END
BEGIN NOW From a sense of humour keen, END
BEGIN NOW And catch a glimpse in a passing phiz END
BEGIN NOW Of his broad, good-humoured grin. END
BEGIN NOW And I had a love -- 'twas a love to prize -- END
BEGIN NOW But I never went back again . . . END
BEGIN NOW I have seen the light of her kind brown eyes END
BEGIN NOW In many a face since then. END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW The sailors say 'twill be rough to-night, END
BEGIN NOW As they fasten the hatches down, END
BEGIN NOW The south is black, and the bar is white, END
BEGIN NOW And the drifting smoke is brown. END
BEGIN NOW The gold has gone from the western haze, END
BEGIN NOW The sea-birds circle and swarm -- END
BEGIN NOW But we shall have plenty of sunny days, END
BEGIN NOW And little enough of storm. END
BEGIN NOW The hill is hiding the short black pier, END
BEGIN NOW As the last white signal's seen; END
BEGIN NOW The points run in, and the houses veer, END
BEGIN NOW And the great bluff stands between. END
BEGIN NOW So darkness swallows each far white speck END
BEGIN NOW On many a wharf and quay. END
BEGIN NOW The night comes down on a restless deck, -- END
BEGIN NOW Grim cliffs -- and -- The Open Sea! END
BEGIN NOW It was somewhere in September, and the sun was going down, END
BEGIN NOW When I came, in search of 'copy', to a Darling-River town; END
BEGIN NOW 'Neath the public-house verandah I was resting on a bunk END
BEGIN NOW When a stranger rose before me, and he said that he was drunk; END
BEGIN NOW He apologised for speaking; there was no offence, he swore; END
BEGIN NOW But he somehow seemed to fancy that he'd seen my face before. END
BEGIN NOW 'No erfence,' he said. I told him that he needn't mention it, END
BEGIN NOW For I might have met him somewhere; I had travelled round a bit, END
BEGIN NOW And I knew a lot of fellows in the bush and in the streets -- END
BEGIN NOW But a fellow can't remember all the fellows that he meets. END
BEGIN NOW Very old and thin and dirty were the garments that he wore, END
BEGIN NOW Just a shirt and pair of trousers, and a boot, and nothing more; END
BEGIN NOW He was wringing-wet, and really in a sad and sinful plight, END
BEGIN NOW And his hat was in his left hand, and a bottle in his right. END
BEGIN NOW His brow was broad and roomy, but its lines were somewhat harsh, END
BEGIN NOW And a sensual mouth was hidden by a drooping, fair moustache; END
BEGIN NOW (His hairy chest was open to what poets call the 'wined', END
BEGIN NOW And I would have bet a thousand that his pants were gone behind). END
BEGIN NOW 'Only for the blanky horses walkin' over him all night.' END
BEGIN NOW He'd apparently been fighting, for his face was black-and-blue, END
BEGIN NOW And he looked as though the horses had been treading on him, too; END
BEGIN NOW It appeared that he mistook me for a long-lost mate of his -- END
BEGIN NOW One of whom I was the image, both in figure and in phiz -- END
BEGIN NOW (He'd have had a letter from him if the chap were living still, END
BEGIN NOW For they'd carried swags together from the Gulf to Broken Hill.) END
BEGIN NOW Sweeney yarned awhile and hinted that his folks were doing well, END
BEGIN NOW And he told me that his father kept the Southern Cross Hotel; END
BEGIN NOW And I wondered if his absence was regarded as a loss END
BEGIN NOW When he left the elder Sweeney -- landlord of the Southern Cross. END
BEGIN NOW He was born in Parramatta, and he said, with humour grim, END
BEGIN NOW That he'd like to see the city ere the liquor finished him, END
BEGIN NOW But he couldn't raise the money. He was damned if he could think END
BEGIN NOW I declined -- 'TWAS self-denial -- and I lectured him on booze, END
BEGIN NOW Using all the hackneyed arguments that preachers mostly use; END
BEGIN NOW Then a wise expression struggled with the bruises on his face, END
BEGIN NOW Though his argument had scarcely any bearing on the case: END
BEGIN NOW But he couldn't stay to argue, for his beer was nearly gone. END
BEGIN NOW He was glad, he said, to meet me, and he'd see me later on; END
BEGIN NOW He guessed he'd have to go and get his bottle filled again, END
BEGIN NOW And he gave a lurch and vanished in the darkness and the rain. END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW And of afternoons in cities, when the rain is on the land, END
BEGIN NOW Visions come to me of Sweeney with his bottle in his hand, END
BEGIN NOW With the stormy night behind him, and the pub verandah-post -- END
BEGIN NOW And I wonder why he haunts me more than any other ghost. END
BEGIN NOW Still I see the shearers drinking at the township in the scrub, END
BEGIN NOW And the army praying nightly at the door of every pub, END
BEGIN NOW Well, perhaps, it isn't funny; there were links between us two -- END
BEGIN NOW And, perhaps, his face forewarned me of a face that I might see END
BEGIN NOW From a bitter cup reflected in the wretched days to be. END

BEGIN NOW Comes riding home again. END
BEGIN NOW And well his stock-horse bears him, END
BEGIN NOW And light of heart is he, END
BEGIN NOW And stoutly his old pack-horse END
BEGIN NOW Is trotting by his knee. END
BEGIN NOW Up Queensland way with cattle END
BEGIN NOW He travelled regions vast; END
BEGIN NOW And many months have vanished END
BEGIN NOW Since home-folk saw him last. END

BEGIN NOW Beyond the hazy dado END
BEGIN NOW Against the lower skies END

BEGIN NOW And every creek and gully END
BEGIN NOW Sends forth its little flood, END

BEGIN NOW Now Harry speaks to Rover, END

BEGIN NOW Than e'er it ran before; END
BEGIN NOW The saddle-horse is failing, END
BEGIN NOW And only half-way o'er! END
BEGIN NOW When flashes next the lightning, END
BEGIN NOW The flood's grey breast is blank, END
BEGIN NOW And a cattle dog and pack-horse END
BEGIN NOW Are struggling up the bank. END
BEGIN NOW But in the lonely homestead END
BEGIN NOW The girl will wait in vain -- END
BEGIN NOW He'll never pass the stations END
BEGIN NOW In charge of stock again. END
BEGIN NOW The faithful dog a moment END
BEGIN NOW Sits panting on the bank, END
BEGIN NOW And then swims through the current END
BEGIN NOW To where his master sank. END
BEGIN NOW And round and round in circles END
BEGIN NOW He fights with failing strength, END
BEGIN NOW Till, borne down by the waters, END
BEGIN NOW The old dog sinks at length. END
BEGIN NOW Across the flooded lowlands END
BEGIN NOW And slopes of sodden loam END
BEGIN NOW The pack-horse struggles onward, END

BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW The floods are in the ocean, END
BEGIN NOW The stream is clear again, END
BEGIN NOW And now a verdant carpet END
BEGIN NOW Is stretched across the plain. END
BEGIN NOW But someone's eyes are saddened, END
BEGIN NOW And someone's heart still bleeds END
BEGIN NOW In sorrow for the drover END
BEGIN NOW Who sleeps among the reeds. END
BEGIN NOW They stood by the door of the Inn on the Rise; END
BEGIN NOW May Carney looked up in the bushranger's eyes: END
BEGIN NOW 'Oh! why did you come? -- it was mad of you, Jack; END
BEGIN NOW You know that the troopers are out on your track.' END
BEGIN NOW A laugh and a shake of his obstinate head -- END
BEGIN NOW 'I wanted a dance, and I'll chance it,' he said. END
BEGIN NOW Some twenty-odd bushmen had come to the 'ball', END
BEGIN NOW But Jack from his youth had been known to them all, END
BEGIN NOW And bushmen are soft where a woman is fair, END
BEGIN NOW So the love of May Carney protected him there; END
BEGIN NOW And all the short evening -- it seems like romance -- END
BEGIN NOW She danced with a bushranger taking his chance. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas midnight -- the dancers stood suddenly still, END
BEGIN NOW For hoofs had been heard on the side of the hill! END
BEGIN NOW Ben Duggan, the drover, along the hillside END
BEGIN NOW Came riding as only a bushman can ride. END
BEGIN NOW He sprang from his horse, to the shanty he sped -- END
BEGIN NOW 'The troopers are down in the gully!' he said. END
BEGIN NOW Quite close to the homestead the troopers were seen. END
BEGIN NOW 'Clear out and ride hard for the ranges, Jack Dean! END
BEGIN NOW Be quick!' said May Carney -- her hand on her heart -- END
BEGIN NOW 'We'll bluff them awhile, and 'twill give you a start.' END
BEGIN NOW He lingered a moment -- to kiss her, of course -- END
BEGIN NOW Then ran to the trees where he'd hobbled his horse. END
BEGIN NOW She ran to the gate, and the troopers were there -- END
BEGIN NOW The jingle of hobbles came faint on the air -- END
BEGIN NOW Then loudly she screamed: it was only to drown END
BEGIN NOW The treacherous clatter of slip-rails let down. END
BEGIN NOW But troopers are sharp, and she saw at a glance END
BEGIN NOW That someone was taking a desperate chance. END
BEGIN NOW They chased, and they shouted, 'Surrender, Jack Dean!' END
BEGIN NOW They called him three times in the name of the Queen. END
BEGIN NOW Then came from the darkness the clicking of locks; END
BEGIN NOW The crack of the rifles was heard in the rocks! END
BEGIN NOW A shriek and a shout, and a rush of pale men -- END
BEGIN NOW And there lay the bushranger, chancing it then. END
BEGIN NOW The sergeant dismounted and knelt on the sod -- END
BEGIN NOW 'Your bushranging's over -- make peace, Jack, with God!' END
BEGIN NOW The bushranger laughed -- not a word he replied, END
BEGIN NOW But turned to the girl who knelt down by his side. END
BEGIN NOW He gazed in her eyes as she lifted his head: END
BEGIN NOW 'Just kiss me -- my girl -- and -- I'll -- chance it,' he said. END
BEGIN NOW When the last rose-tint is fading on the distant mulga scrub, END
BEGIN NOW Then the Army prays for Watty at the entrance of his pub. END
BEGIN NOW Now, I often sit at Watty's when the night is very near, END
BEGIN NOW With a head that's full of jingles and the fumes of bottled beer, END
BEGIN NOW When the Army prays for Watty, I'm included in the prayer. END
BEGIN NOW Watty lounges in his arm-chair, in its old accustomed place, END
BEGIN NOW With a fatherly expression on his round and passive face; END
BEGIN NOW And his arms are clasped before him in a calm, contented way, END
BEGIN NOW And he nods his head and dozes when he hears the Army pray. END
BEGIN NOW And I wonder does he ponder on the distant years and dim, END
BEGIN NOW Or his chances over yonder, when the Army prays for him? END
BEGIN NOW Has he not a fear connected with the warm place down below, END
BEGIN NOW Where, according to good Christians, all the publicans should go? END
BEGIN NOW But his features give no token of a feeling in his breast, END
BEGIN NOW Save of peace that is unbroken and a conscience well at rest; END
BEGIN NOW And we guzzle as we guzzled long before the Army came, END
BEGIN NOW It would take a lot of praying -- lots of thumping on the drum -- END
BEGIN NOW But I love my fellow-sinners, and I hope, upon the whole, END
BEGIN NOW That the Army gets a hearing when it prays for Watty's soul. END
BEGIN NOW Day of ending for beginnings! END
BEGIN NOW Ocean hath another innings, END

BEGIN NOW For another vessel sailing END
BEGIN NOW With the shadow-ships at sea; END
BEGIN NOW Shadow-ships for ever sinking -- END

BEGIN NOW Corpses, floating round untrodden END
BEGIN NOW Cliffs, where nought but sea-drift strays; END

BEGIN NOW Not a mark to show their races -- END

BEGIN NOW Falling, rising, face from me; END
BEGIN NOW God in heaven! stay the gloating, END
BEGIN NOW Mocking singing of the sea! END
BEGIN NOW Jack Denver died on Talbragar when Christmas Eve began, END
BEGIN NOW And there was sorrow round the place, for Denver was a man; END
BEGIN NOW But big Ben Duggan saddled up, and galloped fast and far, END
BEGIN NOW To raise the longest funeral ever seen on Talbragar. END
BEGIN NOW _By station home END
BEGIN NOW And shearing shed END
BEGIN NOW Ben Duggan cried, 'Jack Denver's dead! END
BEGIN NOW He borrowed horses here and there, and rode all Christmas Eve, END
BEGIN NOW And scarcely paused a moment's time the mournful news to leave; END
BEGIN NOW He rode by lonely huts and farms, and when the day was done END
BEGIN NOW He turned his panting horse's head and rode to Ross's Run. END
BEGIN NOW No bushman in a single day had ridden half so far END
BEGIN NOW Since Johnson brought the doctor to his wife at Talbragar. END
BEGIN NOW _By diggers' camps END
BEGIN NOW Ben Duggan sped -- END
BEGIN NOW At each he cried, 'Jack Denver's dead! END
BEGIN NOW That night he passed the humpies of the splitters on the ridge, END
BEGIN NOW And roused the bullock-drivers camped at Belinfante's Bridge; END
BEGIN NOW And as he climbed the ridge again the moon shone on the rise; END
BEGIN NOW _At Blackman's Run END
BEGIN NOW Before the dawn, END
BEGIN NOW Ben Duggan cried, 'Poor Denver's gone! END
BEGIN NOW But in the gorge by Deadman's Gap the mountain shades were black, END
BEGIN NOW He saw too late, and then he heard the swift hoof's sudden jar, END
BEGIN NOW And big Ben Duggan ne'er again rode home to Talbragar. END
BEGIN NOW _'The wretch is drunk, END
BEGIN NOW And Denver's dead -- END
BEGIN NOW A burning shame!' the people said END
BEGIN NOW For thirty miles round Talbragar the boys rolled up in strength, END
BEGIN NOW And Denver had a funeral a good long mile in length; END
BEGIN NOW But some returning homeward found, by light of moon and star, END
BEGIN NOW Ben Duggan dying in the rocks, five miles from Talbragar. END
BEGIN NOW _They knelt around, END
BEGIN NOW He raised his head END
BEGIN NOW And faintly gasped, 'Jack Denver's dead, END
BEGIN NOW But one short hour before he died he woke to understand, END
BEGIN NOW They told him, when he asked them, that the funeral was 'grand'; END
BEGIN NOW And then there came into his eyes a strange victorious light, END
BEGIN NOW He smiled on them in triumph, and his great soul took its flight. END
BEGIN NOW How Duggan raised a funeral years back on Talbragar. END
BEGIN NOW _And far and wide END
BEGIN NOW When Duggan died, END
BEGIN NOW The bushmen of the western side END
BEGIN NOW while passion and pride are strong -- END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW to the tread of a mighty war, END

BEGIN NOW And all that ever shall be, so long as man has a soul to save. END
BEGIN NOW who'd ride with a stockman scout, END

BEGIN NOW the facts that are hard to explain, END

BEGIN NOW and the tales of the ship and fort END
BEGIN NOW at the tales of our chivalry, END

BEGIN NOW When the children run to the doors and cry: END
BEGIN NOW 'Oh, mother, the troops are come!' END

BEGIN NOW and the crimes of the peace we boast, END
BEGIN NOW Out West, where the stars are brightest, END
BEGIN NOW Where the scorching north wind blows, END
BEGIN NOW And the bones of the dead gleam whitest, END
BEGIN NOW And the sun on a desert glows -- END
BEGIN NOW Yet within the selfish kingdom END
BEGIN NOW Where man starves man for gain, END
BEGIN NOW Where white men tramp for existence -- END
BEGIN NOW Wide lies the Great Grey Plain. END
BEGIN NOW No break in its awful horizon, END
BEGIN NOW No blur in the dazzling haze, END
BEGIN NOW Save where by the bordering timber END
BEGIN NOW The fierce, white heat-waves blaze, END
BEGIN NOW And out where the tank-heap rises END
BEGIN NOW Or looms when the sunlights wane, END
BEGIN NOW Till it seems like a distant mountain END
BEGIN NOW Low down on the Great Grey Plain. END
BEGIN NOW No sign of a stream or fountain, END
BEGIN NOW No spring on its dry, hot breast, END
BEGIN NOW No shade from the blazing noontide END
BEGIN NOW Where a weary man might rest. END
BEGIN NOW Whole years go by when the glowing END
BEGIN NOW Sky never clouds for rain -- END
BEGIN NOW Only the shrubs of the desert END
BEGIN NOW From the camp, while the rich man's dreaming, END
BEGIN NOW Come the 'traveller' and his mate, END
BEGIN NOW In the ghastly dawnlight seeming END
BEGIN NOW Like a swagman's ghost out late; END
BEGIN NOW And the horseman blurs in the distance, END
BEGIN NOW While still the stars remain, END
BEGIN NOW A low, faint dust-cloud haunting END
BEGIN NOW His track on the Great Grey Plain. END
BEGIN NOW And all day long from before them END
BEGIN NOW The mirage smokes away -- END
BEGIN NOW That daylight ghost of an ocean END
BEGIN NOW Creeps close behind all day END
BEGIN NOW With an evil, snake-like motion, END
BEGIN NOW As the waves of a madman's brain: END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis a phantom NOT like water END
BEGIN NOW Out there on the Great Grey Plain. END
BEGIN NOW There's a run on the Western limit END
BEGIN NOW Where a man lives like a beast, END
BEGIN NOW And a shanty in the mulga END
BEGIN NOW That stretches to the East; END
BEGIN NOW And the hopeless men who carry END
BEGIN NOW Their swags and tramp in pain -- END
BEGIN NOW The footmen must not tarry END
BEGIN NOW Out there on the Great Grey Plain. END
BEGIN NOW Out West, where the stars are brightest, END
BEGIN NOW Where the scorching north wind blows, END
BEGIN NOW And the bones of the dead seem whitest, END
BEGIN NOW And the sun on a desert glows -- END
BEGIN NOW Out back in the hungry distance END
BEGIN NOW That brave hearts dare in vain -- END
BEGIN NOW Where beggars tramp for existence -- END
BEGIN NOW There lies the Great Grey Plain. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis a desert not more barren END
BEGIN NOW Than the Great Grey Plain of years, END
BEGIN NOW Where a fierce fire burns the hearts of men -- END
BEGIN NOW Dries up the fount of tears: END

BEGIN NOW Where the souls of a race are murdered END
BEGIN NOW When I was up the country in the rough and early days, END
BEGIN NOW I used to work along ov Jimmy Nowlett's bullick-drays; END

BEGIN NOW Through the plains an' 'cross the ranges in the days of long ago. END
BEGIN NOW _Then it's yoke up the bullicks and tramp beside 'em slow, END
BEGIN NOW An' saddle up yer horses an' a-ridin' we will go, END
BEGIN NOW To the bullick-drivin', cattle-drovin', END
BEGIN NOW Days o' long ago._ END
BEGIN NOW Once me and Jimmy Nowlett loaded timber for the town, END
BEGIN NOW But we hadn't gone a dozen mile before the rain come down, END
BEGIN NOW An' me an' Jimmy Nowlett an' the bullicks an' the dray END
BEGIN NOW Was cut off on some risin' ground while floods around us lay; END
BEGIN NOW An' we soon run short of tucker an' terbacca, which was bad, END
BEGIN NOW An' pertaters dipped in honey was the only tuck we had. END
BEGIN NOW An' half our bullicks perished when the drought was on the land, END
BEGIN NOW An' the burnin' heat that dazzles as it dances on the sand; END
BEGIN NOW But we pulled ourselves together, for we never used ter know END
BEGIN NOW What a feather bed was good for in those days o' long ago. END
BEGIN NOW But in spite ov barren ridges an' in spite ov mud an' heat, END
BEGIN NOW An' in spite of modern progress, and in spite of all their blow, END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas a better land to live in, in the days o' long ago. END
BEGIN NOW When the frosty moon was shinin' o'er the ranges like a lamp, END
BEGIN NOW An' a lot of bullick-drivers was a-campin' on the camp, END
BEGIN NOW When the fire was blazin' cheery an' the pipes was drawin' well, END
BEGIN NOW Then our songs we useter chorus an' our yarns we useter tell; END
BEGIN NOW An' we'd talk ov lands we come from, and ov chaps we useter know, END
BEGIN NOW Still we pauses at the shanty just to have a drop er cheer, END
BEGIN NOW Still I feels a kind ov pleasure when the campin'-ground is near; END
BEGIN NOW O'er the timber-truck for shelter in the days ov long ago. END
BEGIN NOW I have been a-driftin' back'ards with the changes ov the land, END
BEGIN NOW An' if I spoke ter bullicks now they wouldn't understand, END
BEGIN NOW But when Mary wakes me sudden in the night I'll often say: END
BEGIN NOW An' if Jimmy uses doubleyou instead of ar an' vee, END
BEGIN NOW An' if he drops his aitches, then you're sure to know it's he. END

BEGIN NOW Days o' long ago._ END
BEGIN NOW His old clay pipe stuck in his mouth, END
BEGIN NOW His hat pushed from his brow, END
BEGIN NOW His dress best fitted for the South -- END
BEGIN NOW I think I see him now; END
BEGIN NOW And when the city streets are still, END
BEGIN NOW And sleep upon me comes, END
BEGIN NOW I often dream that me an' Bill END
BEGIN NOW Are humpin' of our drums. END
BEGIN NOW I mind the time when first I came END
BEGIN NOW A stranger to the land; END
BEGIN NOW And I was stumped, an' sick, an' lame END
BEGIN NOW When Bill took me in hand. END
BEGIN NOW Old Bill was what a chap would call END
BEGIN NOW A friend in poverty, END
BEGIN NOW And he was very kind to all, END
BEGIN NOW And very good to me. END
BEGIN NOW We'd camp beneath the lonely trees END
BEGIN NOW And sit beside the blaze, END
BEGIN NOW A-nursin' of our wearied knees, END
BEGIN NOW A-smokin' of our clays. END
BEGIN NOW Or when we'd journeyed damp an' far, END
BEGIN NOW An' clouds were in the skies, END
BEGIN NOW We'd camp in some old shanty bar, END
BEGIN NOW And sit a-tellin' lies. END
BEGIN NOW Though time had writ upon his brow END
BEGIN NOW And rubbed away his curls, END
BEGIN NOW He always was -- an' may be now -- END
BEGIN NOW A favourite with the girls; END
BEGIN NOW I've heard bush-wimmin scream an' squall -- END
BEGIN NOW I've see'd 'em laugh until END
BEGIN NOW They could not do their work at all, END
BEGIN NOW He was the jolliest old pup END
BEGIN NOW As ever you did see, END
BEGIN NOW And often at some bush kick-up END
BEGIN NOW They'd make old Bill M.C. END
BEGIN NOW He'd make them dance and sing all night, END
BEGIN NOW He'd make the music hum, END
BEGIN NOW But he'd be gone at mornin' light END
BEGIN NOW A-humpin' of his drum. END
BEGIN NOW Though joys of which the poet rhymes END
BEGIN NOW I think we had some good old times END
BEGIN NOW Out on the wallaby. END
BEGIN NOW I took a wife and left off rum, END
BEGIN NOW An' camped beneath a roof; END
BEGIN NOW But Bill preferred to hump his drum END
BEGIN NOW A-paddin' of the hoof. END
BEGIN NOW The lazy, idle loafers what END
BEGIN NOW In toney houses camp END
BEGIN NOW Would call old Bill a drunken sot, END
BEGIN NOW A loafer, or a tramp; END
BEGIN NOW But if the dead should ever dance -- END
BEGIN NOW As poets say they will -- END
BEGIN NOW I think I'd rather take my chance END
BEGIN NOW His long life's-day is nearly o'er, END
BEGIN NOW Its shades begin to fall; END
BEGIN NOW He soon must mount his bluey for END
BEGIN NOW The last long tramp of all; END
BEGIN NOW I trust that when, in bush an' town, END
BEGIN NOW He's lived and learnt his fill, END
BEGIN NOW They'll let the golden slip-rails down END
BEGIN NOW For poor old Corny Bill. END
BEGIN NOW The rafters are open to sun, moon, and star, END
BEGIN NOW Thistles and nettles grow high in the bar -- END
BEGIN NOW The chimneys are crumbling, the log fires are dead, END
BEGIN NOW And green mosses spring from the hearthstone instead. END
BEGIN NOW The voices are silent, the bustle and din, END
BEGIN NOW For the railroad hath ruined the Cherry-tree Inn. END
BEGIN NOW Save the glimmer of stars, or the moon's pallid streams, END
BEGIN NOW And the sounds of the 'possums that camp on the beams, END
BEGIN NOW The bar-room is dark and the stable is still, END
BEGIN NOW For the coach comes no more over Cherry-tree Hill. END
BEGIN NOW No riders push on through the darkness to win END
BEGIN NOW The rest and the comfort of Cherry-tree Inn. END
BEGIN NOW I drift from my theme, for my memory strays END
BEGIN NOW To the carrying, digging, and bushranging days -- END
BEGIN NOW Far back to the seasons that I love the best, END
BEGIN NOW When a stream of wild diggers rushed into the west, END
BEGIN NOW But the 'rushes' grew feeble, and sluggish, and thin, END
BEGIN NOW Till scarcely a swagman passed Cherry-tree Inn. END
BEGIN NOW Do you think, my old mate (if it's thinking you be), END
BEGIN NOW Of the days when you tramped to the goldfields with me? END
BEGIN NOW Do you think of the day of our thirty-mile tramp, END
BEGIN NOW When never a fire could we light on the camp, END
BEGIN NOW And, weary and footsore and drenched to the skin, END
BEGIN NOW We tramped through the darkness to Cherry-tree Inn? END
BEGIN NOW Then I had a sweetheart and you had a wife, END
BEGIN NOW And Johnny was more to his mother than life; END
BEGIN NOW But we solemnly swore, ere that evening was done, END
BEGIN NOW That we'd never return till our fortunes were won. END
BEGIN NOW Next morning to harvests of folly and sin END
BEGIN NOW We tramped o'er the ranges from Cherry-tree Inn. END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW The years have gone over with many a change, END
BEGIN NOW And there comes an old swagman from over the range, END
BEGIN NOW And faint 'neath the weight of his rain-sodden load, END
BEGIN NOW He suddenly thinks of the inn by the road. END
BEGIN NOW He tramps through the darkness the shelter to win, END
BEGIN NOW And reaches the ruins of Cherry-tree Inn. END
BEGIN NOW I am back from up the country -- very sorry that I went -- END
BEGIN NOW Seeking for the Southern poets' land whereon to pitch my tent; END
BEGIN NOW I have lost a lot of idols, which were broken on the track, END
BEGIN NOW Burnt a lot of fancy verses, and I'm glad that I am back. END
BEGIN NOW Further out may be the pleasant scenes of which our poets boast, END
BEGIN NOW But I think the country's rather more inviting round the coast. END
BEGIN NOW Anyway, I'll stay at present at a boarding-house in town, END
BEGIN NOW Drinking beer and lemon-squashes, taking baths and cooling down. END
BEGIN NOW 'Sunny plains'! Great Scott! -- those burning END
BEGIN NOW wastes of barren soil and sand END
BEGIN NOW With their everlasting fences stretching out across the land! END
BEGIN NOW Desolation where the crow is! Desert where the eagle flies, END
BEGIN NOW Turned from some infernal furnace on a plain devoid of grass. END
BEGIN NOW Where the God-forgotten hatter dreams of city life and beer. END
BEGIN NOW Treacherous tracks that trap the stranger, END
BEGIN NOW endless roads that gleam and glare, END
BEGIN NOW Dark and evil-looking gullies, hiding secrets here and there! END
BEGIN NOW Land of day and night -- no morning freshness, and no afternoon, END
BEGIN NOW When the great white sun in rising bringeth summer heat in June. END
BEGIN NOW Dismal country for the exile, when the shades begin to fall END
BEGIN NOW From the sad heart-breaking sunset, to the new-chum worst of all. END
BEGIN NOW Dreary land in rainy weather, with the endless clouds that drift END
BEGIN NOW O'er the bushman like a blanket that the Lord will never lift -- END
BEGIN NOW Ghastly fires in lonely humpies where the granite rocks are piled END
BEGIN NOW Land where gaunt and haggard women live alone and work like men, END
BEGIN NOW Till their husbands, gone a-droving, will return to them again: END

BEGIN NOW It was pleasant up the country, City Bushman, where you went, END
BEGIN NOW For you sought the greener patches and you travelled like a gent; END
BEGIN NOW Though you know the squalid city needn't keep you from the bush; END
BEGIN NOW But his back is growing rounder -- slaving for the absentee -- END
BEGIN NOW And his toiling wife is thinner than a country wife should be. END
BEGIN NOW For we noticed that the faces of the folks we chanced to meet END
BEGIN NOW Should have made a greater contrast to the faces in the street; END
BEGIN NOW And, in short, we think the bushman's being driven to the wall, END
BEGIN NOW And it's doubtful if his spirit will be 'loyal thro' it all'. END
BEGIN NOW Though the bush has been romantic and it's nice to sing about, END
BEGIN NOW There's a lot of patriotism that the land could do without -- END
BEGIN NOW Sort of BRITISH WORKMAN nonsense that shall perish in the scorn END
BEGIN NOW Of the drover who is driven and the shearer who is shorn, END
BEGIN NOW Of the struggling western farmers who have little time for rest, END
BEGIN NOW And are ruined on selections in the sheep-infested West; END
BEGIN NOW Droving songs are very pretty, but they merit little thanks END
BEGIN NOW From the people of a country in possession of the Banks. END
BEGIN NOW For the drought will go on drying while there's anything to dry, END
BEGIN NOW Then it rains until you'd fancy it would bleach the sunny sky -- END

BEGIN NOW Nearly sweeps the population to the Great Australian Bight. END
BEGIN NOW It is up in Northern Queensland that the seasons do their best, END
BEGIN NOW But it's doubtful if you ever saw a season in the West; END
BEGIN NOW There are years without an autumn or a winter or a spring, END
BEGIN NOW In the bush my ears were opened to the singing of the bird, END
BEGIN NOW But the 'carol of the magpie' was a thing I never heard. END
BEGIN NOW Once the beggar roused my slumbers in a shanty, it is true, END
BEGIN NOW But I only heard him asking, 'Who the blanky blank are you?' END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I heard the shearers singing 'William Riley', out of tune, END
BEGIN NOW Saw 'em fighting round a shanty on a Sunday afternoon, END
BEGIN NOW But the bushman isn't always 'trapping brumbies in the night', END
BEGIN NOW Nor is he for ever riding when 'the morn is fresh and bright', END
BEGIN NOW And he isn't always singing in the humpies on the run -- END
BEGIN NOW And the camp-fire's 'cheery blazes' are a trifle overdone; END
BEGIN NOW We have grumbled with the bushmen round the fire on rainy days, END
BEGIN NOW When the smoke would blind a bullock and there wasn't any blaze, END
BEGIN NOW Save the blazes of our language, for we cursed the fire in turn END
BEGIN NOW Till the atmosphere was heated and the wood began to burn. END
BEGIN NOW Then we had to wring our blueys which were rotting in the swags, END
BEGIN NOW And we saw the sugar leaking through the bottoms of the bags, END
BEGIN NOW And we couldn't raise a chorus, for the toothache and the cramp, END
BEGIN NOW To be losing time and money through the foot-rot in the flock, END
BEGIN NOW And you wouldn't mind the beauties underneath the starry dome END
BEGIN NOW If you had a wife and children and a lot of bills at home. END
BEGIN NOW Did you ever guard the cattle when the night was inky-black, END
BEGIN NOW And it rained, and icy water trickled gently down your back END
BEGIN NOW Till your saddle-weary backbone fell a-aching to the roots END
BEGIN NOW Till a squatter's irate dummy cantered up to warn you off? END
BEGIN NOW Do you think the bush was better in the 'good old droving days', END
BEGIN NOW When the squatter ruled supremely as the king of western ways, END
BEGIN NOW When you got a slip of paper for the little you could earn, END
BEGIN NOW But were forced to take provisions from the station in return -- END
BEGIN NOW When you couldn't keep a chicken at your humpy on the run, END
BEGIN NOW While you 'rose up Willy Riley' -- in the days ere you were born? END
BEGIN NOW Ah! we read about the drovers and the shearers and the like END
BEGIN NOW Till we wonder why such happy and romantic fellows strike. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you fancy that the poets ought to give the bush a rest END
BEGIN NOW Ere they raise a just rebellion in the over-written West? END
BEGIN NOW Where the simple-minded bushman gets a meal and bed and rum END
BEGIN NOW Just by riding round reporting phantom flocks that never come; END
BEGIN NOW Where the idle shanty-keeper never fails to make a draw, END
BEGIN NOW And the dummy gets his tucker through provisions in the law; END
BEGIN NOW Where the labour-agitator -- when the shearers rise in might -- END
BEGIN NOW Makes his money sacrificing all his substance for The Right; END
BEGIN NOW Where the drovers and the shearers and the bushmen and the rest END
BEGIN NOW Never reach the Eldorado of the poets of the West. END
BEGIN NOW And you think the bush is purer and that life is better there, END
BEGIN NOW Of the awful 'city urchin who would greet you with a curse'. END
BEGIN NOW Do you think we're never jolly where the trams and buses rage? END
BEGIN NOW Did you hear the gods in chorus when 'Ri-tooral' held the stage? END
BEGIN NOW Did you catch a ring of sorrow in the city urchin's voice END
BEGIN NOW When they drink and flirt and so on in the glow of private bars? END
BEGIN NOW (And about that self-same attic -- Lord! wherever have you been? END
BEGIN NOW For the struggling needlewoman mostly keeps her attic clean.) END
BEGIN NOW But you'll find it very jolly with the cuff-and-collar push, END
BEGIN NOW And the city seems to suit you, while you rave about the bush. END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW You'll admit that Up-the Country, more especially in drought, END
BEGIN NOW Isn't quite the Eldorado that the poets rave about, END
BEGIN NOW Yet at times we long to gallop where the reckless bushman rides END
BEGIN NOW In the wake of startled brumbies that are flying for their hides; END
BEGIN NOW And to hear the stockwhips rattle just like rifles in the trees! END
BEGIN NOW Long to feel the bridle-leather tugging strongly in the hand END
BEGIN NOW And to feel once more a little like a native of the land. END
BEGIN NOW And the ring of bitter feeling in the jingling of our rhymes END
BEGIN NOW Isn't suited to the country nor the spirit of the times. END
BEGIN NOW Let us go together droving, and returning, if we live, END
BEGIN NOW Try to understand each other while we reckon up the div. END
BEGIN NOW There are scenes in the distance where beauty is not, END
BEGIN NOW On the desolate flats where gaunt appletrees rot. END
BEGIN NOW Where the brooding old ridge rises up to the breeze END
BEGIN NOW From his dark lonely gullies of stringy-bark trees, END
BEGIN NOW There are voice-haunted gaps, ever sullen and strange, END
BEGIN NOW But Eurunderee lies like a gem in the range. END
BEGIN NOW Still I see in my fancy the dark-green and blue END
BEGIN NOW Of the box-covered hills where the five-corners grew; END
BEGIN NOW And the rugged old sheoaks that sighed in the bend END
BEGIN NOW O'er the lily-decked pools where the dark ridges end, END
BEGIN NOW And the scrub-covered spurs running down from the Peak END
BEGIN NOW To the deep grassy banks of Eurunderee Creek. END
BEGIN NOW On the knolls where the vineyards and fruit-gardens are END
BEGIN NOW There's a beauty that even the drought cannot mar; END
BEGIN NOW For I noticed it oft, in the days that are lost, END
BEGIN NOW As I trod on the siding where lingered the frost, END
BEGIN NOW When the shadows of night from the gullies were gone END
BEGIN NOW And the hills in the background were flushed by the dawn. END
BEGIN NOW I was there in late years, but there's many a change END
BEGIN NOW Where the Cudgegong River flows down through the range, END
BEGIN NOW For the curse of the town with the railroad had come, END
BEGIN NOW And the goldfields were dead. And the girl and the chum END
BEGIN NOW And the old home were gone, yet the oaks seemed to speak END
BEGIN NOW Of the hazy old days on Eurunderee Creek. END
BEGIN NOW And I stood by that creek, ere the sunset grew cold, END
BEGIN NOW When the leaves of the sheoaks are traced on the gold, END
BEGIN NOW And I thought of old things, and I thought of old folks, END
BEGIN NOW Till I sighed in my heart to the sigh of the oaks; END
BEGIN NOW For the years waste away like the waters that leak END
BEGIN NOW Through the pebbles and sand of Eurunderee Creek. END
BEGIN NOW Only one old post is standing -- END
BEGIN NOW Solid yet, but only one -- END
BEGIN NOW Where the milking, and the branding, END
BEGIN NOW And the slaughtering were done. END
BEGIN NOW Later years have brought dejection, END
BEGIN NOW Care, and sorrow; but we knew END
BEGIN NOW Happy days on that selection END
BEGIN NOW Then the light of day commencing END
BEGIN NOW Found us at the gully's head, END
BEGIN NOW Splitting timber for the fencing, END
BEGIN NOW Stripping bark to roof the shed. END
BEGIN NOW Hands and hearts the labour strengthened; END
BEGIN NOW Weariness we never knew, END
BEGIN NOW Even when the shadows lengthened END
BEGIN NOW Round the base of Bukaroo. END
BEGIN NOW There for days below the paddock END
BEGIN NOW How the wilderness would yield END
BEGIN NOW While we toiled to win the field. END
BEGIN NOW Bronzed hands we used to sully END
BEGIN NOW Till they were of darkest hue, END
BEGIN NOW 'Burning off' down in the gully END
BEGIN NOW At the back of Bukaroo. END
BEGIN NOW When we came the baby brother END
BEGIN NOW Left in haste his broken toys, END
BEGIN NOW Shouted to the busy mother: END
BEGIN NOW 'Here is dadda and the boys!' END
BEGIN NOW Strange it seems that she was able END
BEGIN NOW For the work that she would do; END
BEGIN NOW How she'd bustle round the table END
BEGIN NOW In the hut 'neath Bukaroo! END
BEGIN NOW When the cows were safely yarded, END
BEGIN NOW And the calves were in the pen, END
BEGIN NOW All the cares of day discarded, END
BEGIN NOW Closed we round the hut-fire then. END
BEGIN NOW Rang the roof with boyish laughter END
BEGIN NOW While the flames o'er-topped the flue; END
BEGIN NOW Happy days remembered after -- END
BEGIN NOW Far away from Bukaroo. END
BEGIN NOW But the years were full of changes, END
BEGIN NOW And a sorrow found us there; END
BEGIN NOW For our home amid the ranges END
BEGIN NOW Was not safe from searching Care. END
BEGIN NOW On he came, a silent creeper; END
BEGIN NOW And another mountain threw END
BEGIN NOW O'er our lives a shadow deeper END
BEGIN NOW Than the shade of Bukaroo. END
BEGIN NOW All the farm is disappearing; END
BEGIN NOW For the home has vanished now, END
BEGIN NOW Mountain scrub has choked the clearing, END
BEGIN NOW Hid the furrows of the plough. END
BEGIN NOW Nearer still the scrub is creeping END
BEGIN NOW Where the little garden grew; END
BEGIN NOW And the old folks now are sleeping END
BEGIN NOW At the foot of Bukaroo. END
BEGIN NOW The Fire at Ross's Farm END
BEGIN NOW The squatter saw his pastures wide END
BEGIN NOW The farmers moving to the west END
BEGIN NOW Selected on his run; END
BEGIN NOW Selectors took the water up END
BEGIN NOW And all the black soil round; END
BEGIN NOW The best grass-land the squatter had END
BEGIN NOW Was spoilt by Ross's Ground. END
BEGIN NOW Now many schemes to shift old Ross END
BEGIN NOW Had racked the squatter's brains, END
BEGIN NOW But Sandy had the stubborn blood END
BEGIN NOW Of Scotland in his veins; END
BEGIN NOW He held the land and fenced it in, END
BEGIN NOW He cleared and ploughed the soil, END
BEGIN NOW And year by year a richer crop END
BEGIN NOW Repaid him for his toil. END
BEGIN NOW Between the homes for many years END
BEGIN NOW The devil left his tracks: END
BEGIN NOW The squatter pounded Ross's stock, END
BEGIN NOW And Sandy pounded Black's. END
BEGIN NOW A well upon the lower run END
BEGIN NOW Was filled with earth and logs, END
BEGIN NOW And Black laid baits about the farm END
BEGIN NOW To poison Ross's dogs. END
BEGIN NOW It was, indeed, a deadly feud END
BEGIN NOW Of class and creed and race; END
BEGIN NOW But, yet, there was a Romeo END
BEGIN NOW And a Juliet in the case; END
BEGIN NOW And more than once across the flats, END
BEGIN NOW Young Robert Black was seen to ride END
BEGIN NOW With pretty Jenny Ross. END
BEGIN NOW One Christmas time, when months of drought END
BEGIN NOW Had parched the western creeks, END
BEGIN NOW The bush-fires started in the north END
BEGIN NOW And travelled south for weeks. END
BEGIN NOW At night along the river-side END
BEGIN NOW The scene was grand and strange -- END
BEGIN NOW The hill-fires looked like lighted streets END
BEGIN NOW Of cities in the range. END
BEGIN NOW The cattle-tracks between the trees END
BEGIN NOW Were like long dusky aisles, END
BEGIN NOW And on a sudden breeze the fire END
BEGIN NOW Would sweep along for miles; END
BEGIN NOW Like sounds of distant musketry END
BEGIN NOW It crackled through the brakes, END
BEGIN NOW And o'er the flat of silver grass END
BEGIN NOW It hissed like angry snakes. END
BEGIN NOW It leapt across the flowing streams END
BEGIN NOW And raced o'er pastures broad; END
BEGIN NOW It climbed the trees and lit the boughs END
BEGIN NOW And through the scrubs it roared. END
BEGIN NOW The bees fell stifled in the smoke END
BEGIN NOW Or perished in their hives, END
BEGIN NOW And with the stock the kangaroos END
BEGIN NOW Went flying for their lives. END
BEGIN NOW When, through the scrub-lands wide, END
BEGIN NOW Young Robert Black came riding home END
BEGIN NOW As only natives ride. END
BEGIN NOW He galloped to the homestead door END
BEGIN NOW And gave the first alarm: END
BEGIN NOW 'The fire is past the granite spur, END
BEGIN NOW 'And close to Ross's farm.' END
BEGIN NOW 'Now, father, send the men at once, END
BEGIN NOW They won't be wanted here; END
BEGIN NOW Poor Ross's wheat is all he has END
BEGIN NOW To pull him through the year.' END
BEGIN NOW 'Then let it burn,' the squatter said; END
BEGIN NOW 'I'd like to see it done -- END
BEGIN NOW I'd bless the fire if it would clear END
BEGIN NOW Selectors from the run. END
BEGIN NOW 'Go if you will,' the squatter said, END
BEGIN NOW 'You shall not take the men -- END
BEGIN NOW Go out and join your precious friends, END
BEGIN NOW And don't come here again.' END
BEGIN NOW 'I won't come back,' young Robert cried, END
BEGIN NOW And, reckless in his ire, END
BEGIN NOW He sharply turned his horse's head END
BEGIN NOW And galloped towards the fire. END
BEGIN NOW And there, for three long weary hours, END
BEGIN NOW Half-blind with smoke and heat, END
BEGIN NOW Old Ross and Robert fought the flames END
BEGIN NOW That neared the ripened wheat. END
BEGIN NOW The farmer's hand was nerved by fears END
BEGIN NOW Of danger and of loss; END
BEGIN NOW And Robert fought the stubborn foe END
BEGIN NOW For the love of Jenny Ross. END
BEGIN NOW But serpent-like the curves and lines END
BEGIN NOW Slipped past them, and between, END
BEGIN NOW Until they reached the bound'ry where END
BEGIN NOW The old coach-road had been. END
BEGIN NOW 'The track is now our only hope, END
BEGIN NOW There we must stand,' cried Ross, END
BEGIN NOW 'For nought on earth can stop the fire END
BEGIN NOW If once it gets across.' END
BEGIN NOW Then came a cruel gust of wind, END
BEGIN NOW And, with a fiendish rush, END
BEGIN NOW The flames leapt o'er the narrow path END
BEGIN NOW And lit the fence of brush. END
BEGIN NOW 'The crop must burn!' the farmer cried, END
BEGIN NOW 'We cannot save it now,' END
BEGIN NOW And down upon the blackened ground END
BEGIN NOW He dashed the ragged bough. END
BEGIN NOW But wildly, in a rush of hope, END
BEGIN NOW His heart began to beat, END
BEGIN NOW For o'er the crackling fire he heard END
BEGIN NOW The sound of horses' feet. END
BEGIN NOW 'Here's help at last,' young Robert cried, END
BEGIN NOW And even as he spoke END
BEGIN NOW The squatter with a dozen men END
BEGIN NOW Came racing through the smoke. END
BEGIN NOW Down on the ground the stockmen jumped END
BEGIN NOW And bared each brawny arm, END
BEGIN NOW They tore green branches from the trees END
BEGIN NOW And fought for Ross's farm; END
BEGIN NOW And when before the gallant band END
BEGIN NOW The beaten flames gave way, END
BEGIN NOW Two grimy hands in friendship joined -- END
BEGIN NOW A cloud of dust on the long white road, END
BEGIN NOW And the teams go creeping on END
BEGIN NOW Inch by inch with the weary load; END
BEGIN NOW And by the power of the green-hide goad END
BEGIN NOW The distant goal is won. END
BEGIN NOW With eyes half-shut to the blinding dust, END
BEGIN NOW And necks to the yokes bent low, END
BEGIN NOW The beasts are pulling as bullocks must; END
BEGIN NOW And the shining tires might almost rust END
BEGIN NOW While the spokes are turning slow. END
BEGIN NOW With face half-hid 'neath a broad-brimmed hat END
BEGIN NOW That shades from the heat's white waves, END
BEGIN NOW And shouldered whip with its green-hide plait, END
BEGIN NOW The driver plods with a gait like that END
BEGIN NOW Of his weary, patient slaves. END
BEGIN NOW He wipes his brow, for the day is hot, END
BEGIN NOW And spits to the left with spite; END
BEGIN NOW He shouts at 'Bally', and flicks at 'Scot', END
BEGIN NOW And raises dust from the back of 'Spot', END
BEGIN NOW And spits to the dusty right. END
BEGIN NOW He'll sometimes pause as a thing of form END
BEGIN NOW In front of a settler's door, END
BEGIN NOW And ask for a drink, and remark 'It's warm, END
BEGIN NOW Or say 'There's signs of a thunder-storm'; END
BEGIN NOW But he seldom utters more. END
BEGIN NOW But the rains are heavy on roads like these; END
BEGIN NOW And, fronting his lonely home, END
BEGIN NOW For weeks together the settler sees END
BEGIN NOW The teams bogged down to the axletrees, END
BEGIN NOW Or ploughing the sodden loam. END
BEGIN NOW And then when the roads are at their worst, END
BEGIN NOW The bushman's children hear END
BEGIN NOW The cruel blows of the whips reversed END
BEGIN NOW While bullocks pull as their hearts would burst, END
BEGIN NOW And bellow with pain and fear. END
BEGIN NOW And thus with little of joy or rest END
BEGIN NOW Are the long, long journeys done; END
BEGIN NOW And thus -- 'tis a cruel war at the best -- END
BEGIN NOW Is distance fought in the mighty West, END
BEGIN NOW And the lonely battles won. END
BEGIN NOW Cameron's Heart END
BEGIN NOW The diggings were just in their glory when Alister Cameron came, END
BEGIN NOW and spoke with respect of his kirk; END
BEGIN NOW He shunned all the girls in the camp, END
BEGIN NOW and they said he was proof to the dart -- END
BEGIN NOW That nothing but whisky and gaming had ever a place in his heart; END
BEGIN NOW A bit of a worn silver chain, and the portrait of Cameron's girl. END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW It chanced in the first of the Sixties that Ally and I and McKean END
BEGIN NOW where it suddenly stopped, and hung still. END
BEGIN NOW I knew what was up in a moment when Cameron shouted to me: END
BEGIN NOW 'Climb up for your life by the footholes. END
BEGIN NOW And those were the last words he uttered. END
BEGIN NOW He groaned, for I heard him quite plain -- END
BEGIN NOW I wonder did Alister think of the scenes in the distance so dim, END
BEGIN NOW When you haven't got a billet, and the times are very slack, END
BEGIN NOW There is nothing that can spur you like the shame of going back; END
BEGIN NOW Crawling home with empty pockets, END
BEGIN NOW Going back hard-up; END
BEGIN NOW Oh! it's then you learn the meaning of humiliation's cup. END
BEGIN NOW When the place and you are strangers and you struggle all alone, END
BEGIN NOW And you have a mighty longing for the town where you are known; END
BEGIN NOW When your clothes are very shabby and the future's very black, END
BEGIN NOW There is nothing that can hurt you like the shame of going back. END
BEGIN NOW When we've fought the battle bravely and are beaten to the wall, END
BEGIN NOW And your heart is in the shadow of the shame of going back. END
BEGIN NOW When a beaten man's discovered with a bullet in his brain, END
BEGIN NOW But it very often happens that he'd lately got the sack, END
BEGIN NOW And his onward move was owing to the shame of going back. END
BEGIN NOW You will learn the bitter meaning of the shame of going back; END
BEGIN NOW Going home with empty pockets, END
BEGIN NOW Going home hard-up; END
BEGIN NOW Oh, you'll taste the bitter poison in humiliation's cup. END
BEGIN NOW I met Jack Ellis in town to-day -- END
BEGIN NOW Jack Ellis -- my old mate, Jack -- END
BEGIN NOW Ten years ago, from the Castlereagh, END
BEGIN NOW We carried our swags together away END
BEGIN NOW But times have altered since those old days, END
BEGIN NOW And the times have changed the men. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, well! there's little to blame or praise -- END
BEGIN NOW Jack Ellis and I have tramped long ways END
BEGIN NOW On different tracks since then. END
BEGIN NOW His hat was battered, his coat was green, END
BEGIN NOW The toes of his boots were through, END
BEGIN NOW But the pride was his! It was I felt mean -- END
BEGIN NOW I wished that my collar was not so clean, END
BEGIN NOW Nor the clothes I wore so new. END
BEGIN NOW He saw me first, and he knew 'twas I -- END
BEGIN NOW The holiday swell he met. END
BEGIN NOW Why have we no faith in each other? Ah, why? -- END
BEGIN NOW He made as though he would pass me by, END
BEGIN NOW For he thought that I might forget. END
BEGIN NOW He ought to have known me better than that, END
BEGIN NOW By the tracks we tramped far out -- END
BEGIN NOW The sweltering scrub and the blazing flat, END
BEGIN NOW When the heat came down through each old felt hat END
BEGIN NOW In the hell-born western drought. END
BEGIN NOW The cheques we made and the shanty sprees, END
BEGIN NOW The camps in the great blind scrub, END
BEGIN NOW The long wet tramps when the plains were seas, END
BEGIN NOW And the oracles worked in days like these END
BEGIN NOW For rum and tobacco and grub. END
BEGIN NOW Could I forget how we struck 'the same END
BEGIN NOW Old tale' in the nearer West, END
BEGIN NOW When the first great test of our friendship came -- END
BEGIN NOW But -- well, there's little to praise or blame END
BEGIN NOW If our mateship stood the test. END
BEGIN NOW 'Heads!' he laughed (but his face was stern) -- END
BEGIN NOW 'Tails!' and a friendly oath; END
BEGIN NOW We loved her fair, we had much to learn -- END
BEGIN NOW And each was stabbed to the heart in turn END
BEGIN NOW By the girl who -- loved us both. END
BEGIN NOW Or the last day lost on the lignum plain, END
BEGIN NOW When I staggered, half-blind, half-dead, END
BEGIN NOW With a burning throat and a tortured brain; END
BEGIN NOW And the tank when we came to the track again END
BEGIN NOW Was seventeen miles ahead. END
BEGIN NOW Then life seemed finished -- then death began END
BEGIN NOW As down in the dust I sank, END
BEGIN NOW But he stuck to his mate as a bushman can, END
BEGIN NOW Till I heard him saying, 'Bear up, old man!' END
BEGIN NOW In the shade by the mulga tank. END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW He took my hand in a distant way END
BEGIN NOW (I thought how we parted last), END
BEGIN NOW And we seemed like men who have nought to say END
BEGIN NOW And who meet -- 'Good-day', and who part -- 'Good-day', END
BEGIN NOW Who never have shared the past. END
BEGIN NOW I asked him in for a drink with me -- END
BEGIN NOW Jack Ellis -- my old mate, Jack -- END
BEGIN NOW But his manner no longer was careless and free, END
BEGIN NOW He followed, but not with the grin that he END
BEGIN NOW Wore always in days Out Back. END
BEGIN NOW I tried to live in the past once more -- END
BEGIN NOW Or the present and past combine, END
BEGIN NOW But the days between I could not ignore -- END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't help notice the clothes he wore, END
BEGIN NOW And he couldn't but notice mine. END
BEGIN NOW He placed his glass on the polished bar, END
BEGIN NOW And he wouldn't fill up again; END
BEGIN NOW For he is prouder than most men are -- END
BEGIN NOW Jack Ellis and I have tramped too far END
BEGIN NOW On different tracks since then. END
BEGIN NOW He said that he had a mate to meet, END
BEGIN NOW And 'I'll see you again,' said he, END
BEGIN NOW Then he hurried away through the crowded street END
BEGIN NOW And the rattle of buses and scrape of feet END
BEGIN NOW Seemed suddenly loud to me. END
BEGIN NOW And I almost wished that the time were come END
BEGIN NOW When less will be left to Fate -- END
BEGIN NOW When boys will start on the track from home END
BEGIN NOW With equal chances, and no old chum END
BEGIN NOW Have more or less than his mate. END
BEGIN NOW He had offices in Sydney, not so many years ago, END
BEGIN NOW And his shingle bore the legend 'Peter Anderson and Co.', END
BEGIN NOW But his real name was Careless, as the fellows understood -- END
BEGIN NOW And his relatives decided that he wasn't any good. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas their gentle tongues that blasted any 'character' he had -- END
BEGIN NOW It was limited in number to a unit, was the Co. -- END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas a bosom chum of Peter and his Christian name was Joe. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis a class of men belonging to these soul-forsaken years: END
BEGIN NOW Third-rate canvassers, collectors, journalists and auctioneers. END
BEGIN NOW They are never very shabby, they are never very spruce -- END
BEGIN NOW Going cheerfully and carelessly and smoothly to the deuce. END
BEGIN NOW Some are wanderers by profession, 'turning up' and gone as soon, END
BEGIN NOW Peter met you with the comic smile of one who knows you well, END
BEGIN NOW And is mighty glad to see you, and has got a joke to tell; END
BEGIN NOW Only cynical in cases where his own self was the jest, END
BEGIN NOW And the humour of his good yarns made atonement for the rest. END
BEGIN NOW (You can always furnish cheaply, when your cash or credit fails, END
BEGIN NOW With a packing-case, a hammer, and a pound of two-inch nails -- END
BEGIN NOW And, maybe, a drop of varnish and sienna, too, for tints, END
BEGIN NOW And a scrap or two of oilcloth, and a yard or two of chintz). END
BEGIN NOW The office was their haven, for they lived there when hard-up -- END
BEGIN NOW A 'daily' for a table cloth -- a jam tin for a cup; END
BEGIN NOW And if the landlord's bailiff happened round in times like these END
BEGIN NOW Till another portal boasted 'Peter Anderson and Co.' END
BEGIN NOW no one would have thought 'twas Joe! END
BEGIN NOW Gloriously drunk and happy, till they heard the roosters crow -- END
BEGIN NOW And the landlady and neighbours made complaints about the Co. END
BEGIN NOW But that life! it might be likened to a reckless drinking-song, END
BEGIN NOW For it can't go on for ever, and it never lasted long. END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW Debt-collecting ruined Peter -- people talked him round too oft, END
BEGIN NOW He would ask him round the corner, and it seemed to him and her, END
BEGIN NOW And perhaps it pays in heaven, but on earth it doesn't pay. END
BEGIN NOW They got harder up than ever, and, to make it worse, the Co. END
BEGIN NOW Went more often round the corner than was good for him to go. END
BEGIN NOW 'I might live,' he said to Peter, 'but I haven't got the nerve -- END
BEGIN NOW Eat and drink and love they tell us, for to-morrow we may die, END
BEGIN NOW 'The death of such philosophy's the death I'm dying now. END
BEGIN NOW Pull yourself together, Peter; 'tis the dying wish of Joe END
BEGIN NOW That the business world shall honour Peter Anderson and Co. END
BEGIN NOW 'When you feel your life is sinking in a dull and useless course, END
BEGIN NOW See if you can raise a drink, old man, I'm feelin' mighty bad -- END
BEGIN NOW Or a joke to try on Peter -- or, perhaps, it was the rum. END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW Yet, to show his heart was not of human decency bereft, END
BEGIN NOW Peter paid the undertaker. He got drunk on what was left; END
BEGIN NOW And the dying words of Joseph, ringing through his own despair, END
BEGIN NOW Peter 'pulled himself together' and he started business there. END
BEGIN NOW But his life was very lonely, and his heart was very sad, END
BEGIN NOW And no help to reformation was the company he had -- END
BEGIN NOW And a boundary-rider jogging out across the neighb'ring run END
BEGIN NOW Was attracted by a something that was blazing in the sun; END
BEGIN NOW And he found that it was Peter, lying peacefully at rest, END
BEGIN NOW With a bottle close beside him and the shingle on his breast. END
BEGIN NOW Well, they analysed the liquor, and it would appear that he END
BEGIN NOW Qualified his drink with something good for setting spirits free. END
BEGIN NOW On a lonely selection far out in the West END
BEGIN NOW An old woman works all the day without rest, END
BEGIN NOW And she croons, as she toils 'neath the sky's glassy dome, END
BEGIN NOW 'Sure I'll keep the ould place till the childer come home.' END
BEGIN NOW She mends all the fences, she grubs, and she ploughs, END
BEGIN NOW She drives the old horse and she milks all the cows, END
BEGIN NOW And she sings to herself as she thatches the stack, END
BEGIN NOW 'Sure I'll keep the ould place till the childer come back.' END
BEGIN NOW It is five weary years since her old husband died; END
BEGIN NOW And oft as he lay on his deathbed he sighed END
BEGIN NOW 'Sure one man can bring up ten children, he can, END
BEGIN NOW An' it's strange that ten sons cannot keep one old man.' END
BEGIN NOW Whenever the scowling old sundowners come, END
BEGIN NOW And cunningly ask if the master's at home, END
BEGIN NOW 'Be off,' she replies, 'with your blarney and cant, END
BEGIN NOW Or I'll call my son Andy; he's workin' beyant.' END
BEGIN NOW 'Git out,' she replies, though she trembles with fear, END
BEGIN NOW For she lives all alone and no neighbours are near; END
BEGIN NOW But she says to herself, when she's like to despond, END
BEGIN NOW That the boys are at work in the paddock beyond. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, none of her children need follow the plough, END
BEGIN NOW And some have grown rich in the city ere now; END
BEGIN NOW Yet she says: 'They might come when the shearing is done, END
BEGIN NOW And I'll keep the ould place if it's only for one.' END
BEGIN NOW Tall, and stout, and solid-looking, END
BEGIN NOW Yet a wreck; END
BEGIN NOW None would think Death's finger's hooking END
BEGIN NOW Him from deck. END
BEGIN NOW Cause of half the fun that's started -- END
BEGIN NOW Isn't like a broken-hearted, END
BEGIN NOW Ruined man. END
BEGIN NOW Walking-coat from tail to throat is END
BEGIN NOW Frayed and greened -- END
BEGIN NOW Like a man whose other coat is END
BEGIN NOW Being cleaned; END
BEGIN NOW Gone for ever round the edging END
BEGIN NOW Past repair -- END
BEGIN NOW Waistcoat pockets frayed with dredging END
BEGIN NOW After 'sprats' no longer there. END
BEGIN NOW Wearing summer boots in June, or END
BEGIN NOW Slippers worn and old -- END
BEGIN NOW Like a man whose other shoon are END
BEGIN NOW Getting soled. END
BEGIN NOW Pants? They're far from being recent -- END
BEGIN NOW But, perhaps, I'd better not -- END
BEGIN NOW Says they are the only decent END
BEGIN NOW Pair he's got. END
BEGIN NOW And his hat, I am afraid, is END
BEGIN NOW Past all lifting to the ladies END
BEGIN NOW By the brim. END
BEGIN NOW But, although he'd hardly strike a END
BEGIN NOW Girl, would Dan, END
BEGIN NOW Yet he wears his wreckage like a END
BEGIN NOW Once -- no matter how the rest dressed -- END
BEGIN NOW Up or down -- END
BEGIN NOW Once, they say, he was the best-dressed END
BEGIN NOW Man in town. END
BEGIN NOW Must have been before I knew him -- END
BEGIN NOW Now you'd scarcely care to meet END
BEGIN NOW And be noticed talking to him END
BEGIN NOW In the street. END
BEGIN NOW Drink the cause, and dissipation, END
BEGIN NOW That is clear -- END
BEGIN NOW Maybe friend or kind relation END
BEGIN NOW Cause of beer. END
BEGIN NOW And the talking fool, who never END
BEGIN NOW Reads or thinks, END
BEGIN NOW Says, from hearsay: 'Yes, he's clever; END
BEGIN NOW But, you know, he drinks.' END
BEGIN NOW Been an actor and a writer -- END
BEGIN NOW Doesn't whine -- END
BEGIN NOW Reckoned now the best reciter END
BEGIN NOW In his line. END
BEGIN NOW Takes the stage at times, and fills it -- END
BEGIN NOW Raise a sneer! -- his first line kills it, END
BEGIN NOW Where he lives, or how, or wherefore END
BEGIN NOW No one knows; END
BEGIN NOW Lost his real friends, and therefore END
BEGIN NOW Lost his foes. END
BEGIN NOW Had, no doubt, his own romances -- END
BEGIN NOW Met his fate; END
BEGIN NOW Tortured, doubtless, by the chances END
BEGIN NOW And the luck that comes too late. END
BEGIN NOW Now and then his boots are polished, END
BEGIN NOW Collar clean, END
BEGIN NOW And the worst grease stains abolished END
BEGIN NOW By ammonia or benzine: END
BEGIN NOW Hints of some attempt to shove him END
BEGIN NOW From the taps, END
BEGIN NOW Or of someone left to love him -- END
BEGIN NOW After all, he is a grafter, END
BEGIN NOW Earns his cheer -- END
BEGIN NOW Keeps the room in roars of laughter END
BEGIN NOW When he gets outside a beer. END
BEGIN NOW Yarns that would fall flat from others END
BEGIN NOW He can tell; END
BEGIN NOW How he spent his 'stuff', my brothers, END
BEGIN NOW You know well. END
BEGIN NOW Manner puts a man in mind of END
BEGIN NOW Old club balls and evening dress, END
BEGIN NOW Ugly with a handsome kind of END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW One of those we say of often, END
BEGIN NOW While hearts swell, END
BEGIN NOW Standing sadly by the coffin: END
BEGIN NOW 'He looks well.' END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW We may be -- so goes a rumour -- END
BEGIN NOW But we may not have the humour END
BEGIN NOW Of the man; END
BEGIN NOW Nor the sight -- well, deem it blindness, END
BEGIN NOW As the general public do -- END
BEGIN NOW And the love of human kindness, END
BEGIN NOW Or the GRIT to see it through! END
BEGIN NOW If you fancy that your people came of better stock than mine, END
BEGIN NOW If you hint of higher breeding by a word or by a sign, END
BEGIN NOW If you're proud because of fortune or the clever things you do -- END
BEGIN NOW If you think that your profession has the more gentility, END
BEGIN NOW And that you are condescending to be seen along with me; END
BEGIN NOW If you have a swell companion when you see me on the street, END
BEGIN NOW And you think that I'm too common for your toney friend to meet, END
BEGIN NOW So that I, in passing closely, fail to come within your view -- END
BEGIN NOW Then be blind to me for ever: I'm a prouder man than you! END
BEGIN NOW If your character be blameless, if your outward past be clean, END
BEGIN NOW 'Birds o' feather fly together': I'm a prouder bird than you! END
BEGIN NOW Keep your patronage for others! Gold and station cannot hide END
BEGIN NOW And my wall of pride is shattered: I am not so proud as you! END
BEGIN NOW The creek went down with a broken song, END
BEGIN NOW 'Neath the sheoaks high; END
BEGIN NOW The waters carried the song along, END
BEGIN NOW And the oaks a sigh. END
BEGIN NOW The song and the sigh went winding by, END
BEGIN NOW Went winding down; END
BEGIN NOW Circling the foot of the mountain high, END
BEGIN NOW And the hillside brown. END
BEGIN NOW They were hushed in the swamp of the Dead Man's Crime, END
BEGIN NOW Where the curlews cried; END
BEGIN NOW But they reached the river the self-same time, END
BEGIN NOW And there they died. END
BEGIN NOW And the creek of life goes winding on, END
BEGIN NOW And bears for ever, its course upon, END
BEGIN NOW A song and a sigh. END
BEGIN NOW So you're writing for a paper? Well, it's nothing very new END
BEGIN NOW To be writing yards of drivel for a tidy little screw; END
BEGIN NOW You are young and educated, and a clever chap you are, END
BEGIN NOW But you'll never run a paper like the CAMBAROORA STAR. END
BEGIN NOW Though in point of education I am nothing but a dunce, END
BEGIN NOW I myself -- you mayn't believe it -- helped to run a paper once END
BEGIN NOW With a chap on Cambaroora, by the name of Charlie Brown, END
BEGIN NOW And I'll tell you all about it if you'll take the story down. END
BEGIN NOW On a golden day in summer, when the sunrays were aslant, END
BEGIN NOW Brown arrived in Cambaroora with a little printing plant END
BEGIN NOW He had bought an empty humpy, and, instead of getting tight, END
BEGIN NOW And next day a sign of canvas, writ in characters of tar, END
BEGIN NOW Claimed the humpy as the office of the CAMBAROORA STAR. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I cannot read, that's honest, but I had a digger friend END
BEGIN NOW Who would read the paper to me from the title to the end; END
BEGIN NOW Once I showed it to a critic, and he said 'twas very fine, END
BEGIN NOW Though he wasn't long in finding glaring faults in every line; END
BEGIN NOW But it was a song of Freedom -- all the clever critic said END
BEGIN NOW So I went where Brown was working in his little hut hard by: END
BEGIN NOW And your principles is honest, Brown; I want to shake your hand, END
BEGIN NOW And if there's any lumping in connection with the STAR, END
BEGIN NOW Brown was every inch a digger (bronzed and bearded in the South), END
BEGIN NOW So we worked a little 'paddock' on a place they called the 'Bar', END
BEGIN NOW Well, I didn't shirk my promise, and I helped the thing, I guess, END
BEGIN NOW For she died on Cambaroora when the STAR began to go, END
BEGIN NOW And was buried like the diggers buried diggers long ago. END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW Many nights we'd sit together in the windy hut and fold, END
BEGIN NOW And I helped the thing a little when I struck a patch of gold; END
BEGIN NOW And we battled for the diggers as the papers seldom do, END
BEGIN NOW Though when the diggers errored, why, we touched the diggers too. END
BEGIN NOW And the diggers sent a nugget with their sympathy to Brown. END
BEGIN NOW Oft I sat and smoked beside him in the listening hours of night, END
BEGIN NOW Diggers then had little mercy for the loafer and the scamp -- END
BEGIN NOW If there wasn't law and order, there was justice in the camp; END
BEGIN NOW And the manly independence that is found where diggers are END
BEGIN NOW Had a sentinel to guard it in the CAMBAROORA STAR. END
BEGIN NOW And who only shepherd diggers till they track them to the 'find'. END
BEGIN NOW Charlie wrote a slinging leader, calling on his digger mates, END
BEGIN NOW It was nine o'clock next morning when the Chows began to swarm, END
BEGIN NOW Give three ringing cheers, my hearties, for the CAMBAROORA STAR.' END
BEGIN NOW But the Cambaroora petered, and the diggers' sun went down, END
BEGIN NOW And another sort of people came and settled in the town; END
BEGIN NOW The reefing was conducted by a syndicate or two, END
BEGIN NOW But his leaders went like thunder for their vested interests, END
BEGIN NOW And he fought for right and justice and he raved about the dawn END
BEGIN NOW Of the reign of Man and Reason till his ads. were all withdrawn. END
BEGIN NOW He was offered shares for nothing in the richest of the mines, END
BEGIN NOW And he could have made a fortune had he run on other lines; END
BEGIN NOW They abused him for his leaders, and they parodied his rhymes, END
BEGIN NOW And they told him that his paper was a mile behind the times. END
BEGIN NOW So we fought the battle bravely, and we did our very best END
BEGIN NOW Just to make the final issue quite as lively as the rest. END
BEGIN NOW And the swells in Cambaroora talked of feathers and of tar END
BEGIN NOW When they read the final issue of the CAMBAROORA STAR. END
BEGIN NOW But in vain we scraped together every penny we could get, END
BEGIN NOW Though we gave him ads. for nothing when the STAR began to boom: END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas a paltry bill for tucker, and the crawling, sneaking clown END
BEGIN NOW Sold the debt for twice its value to the men who hated Brown. END
BEGIN NOW I was digging up the river, and I swam the flooded bend END
BEGIN NOW With a little cash and comfort for my literary friend. END
BEGIN NOW Brown was sitting sad and lonely with his head bowed in despair, END
BEGIN NOW While a single tallow candle threw a flicker on his hair, END
BEGIN NOW And the gusty wind that whistled through the crannies of the door END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW Then he stood up on a sudden, with a face as pale as death, END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW Listen! Like the distant thunder of the rollers on the bar -- END
BEGIN NOW though it died when the sun went down; END
BEGIN NOW The river is high and the stream is strong, END
BEGIN NOW and the grass is green and tall, END
BEGIN NOW Let our enemies go by their old dull tracks, END
BEGIN NOW and theirs be the fault or shame END
BEGIN NOW It well may be that I saw too plain, and it may be I was blind; END
BEGIN NOW But I'll keep my face to the dawning light, END
BEGIN NOW though the devil may stand behind! END
BEGIN NOW Marshall's Mate END
BEGIN NOW You almost heard the surface bake, and saw the gum-leaves turn -- END
BEGIN NOW The tanks went dry on Ninety Mile, as tanks go dry out back, END
BEGIN NOW Too blind to see there was no shade, and too done-up to feel. END
BEGIN NOW And charcoaled on the canvas bag ('twas written pretty clear) END
BEGIN NOW 'Spread out as widely as you can each side the track,' said he; END
BEGIN NOW 'The first to find him make a smoke that all the rest can see.' END
BEGIN NOW We took the track and followed back where Crowbar followed fate, END
BEGIN NOW We found a dead man in the scrub -- but 'twas not Crowbar's mate. END
BEGIN NOW And no one, save the spirit of the sand-waste, fierce and lone, END
BEGIN NOW He'd scarcely closed his quiet eyes or drawn a sleeping breath -- END
BEGIN NOW A careless, roving scamp, that loved to laugh and drink and joke, END
BEGIN NOW The search was made as searches are (and often made in vain), END
BEGIN NOW And on the seventh day we saw a smoke across the plain; END
BEGIN NOW And when we gave it best at last, he said, 'I'LL see it through,' END
BEGIN NOW I'll see it so in twenty years, 'twill haunt me all my life -- END
BEGIN NOW I could not face his sister, and I could not face his wife. END
BEGIN NOW It's no use talking to me now -- I'm going back,' he said, END
BEGIN NOW 'I'm going back to find him, and I will -- alive or dead!' END
BEGIN NOW . . . . . END
BEGIN NOW He packed his horse with water and provisions for a week, END
BEGIN NOW And then, at sunset, crossed the plain, away from Dingo Creek. END
BEGIN NOW We watched him tramp beside the horse till we, as it grew late, END
BEGIN NOW Could not tell which was Bonypart and which was Marshall's mate. END
BEGIN NOW The dam went dry at Dingo Creek, and we were driven back, END
BEGIN NOW And none dared face the Ninety Mile when Crowbar took the track. END
BEGIN NOW They saw him at Dead Camel and along the Dry Hole Creeks -- END
BEGIN NOW But no one knew how Crowbar died -- the soul of Marshall knows! END
BEGIN NOW And now, way out on Dingo Creek, when winter days are late, END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the furthest two-rail fence, Colanne and Nevertire -- END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the furthest rabbit-proof, barbed wire and common wire -- END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the Land o' Break-o'-Day, and Sunset and the Dawn, END
BEGIN NOW The soul of Marshall and the soul of Marshall's mate have gone END
BEGIN NOW Unto that Loving, Laughing Land where life is fresh and clean -- END
BEGIN NOW Where the rivers flow all summer, and the grass is always green. END
BEGIN NOW The world has had enough of bards who wish that they were dead, END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis time the people passed a law to knock 'em on the head, END
BEGIN NOW They talk of peace and restfulness connected with the tomb. END
BEGIN NOW They say that man is made of dirt, and die, of course, he must; END
BEGIN NOW But, all the same, a man is made of pretty solid dust. END
BEGIN NOW There is a thing that they forget, so let it here be writ, END
BEGIN NOW That some are made of common mud, and some are made of GRIT; END
BEGIN NOW Some try to help the world along while others fret and fume END
BEGIN NOW And wish that they were slumbering in the silence of the tomb. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twixt mother's arms and coffin-gear a man has work to do! END
BEGIN NOW And if he does his very best he mostly worries through, END
BEGIN NOW And yet, as long as sheoaks sigh and wattle-blossoms bloom, END
BEGIN NOW The world shall hear the drivel of the poets of the tomb. END
BEGIN NOW And though the graveyard poets long to vanish from the scene, END
BEGIN NOW I notice that they mostly wish their resting-place kept green. END
BEGIN NOW Now, were I rotting underground, I do not think I'd care END
BEGIN NOW If wombats rooted on the mound or if the cows camped there; END
BEGIN NOW And should I have some feelings left when I have gone before, END
BEGIN NOW I think a ton of solid stone would hurt my feelings more. END
BEGIN NOW Such wormy songs of mouldy joys can give me no delight; END
BEGIN NOW I'll take my chances with the world, I'd rather live and fight. END
BEGIN NOW While you use your best endeavour to immortalise in verse END
BEGIN NOW You're a clever southern writer, scarce inferior to Bret Harte. END
BEGIN NOW If you sing of waving grasses when the plains are dry as bricks, END
BEGIN NOW And discover shining rivers where there's only mud and sticks; END
BEGIN NOW You are gracefully referred to as the 'young Australian Burns'. END
BEGIN NOW Your grammar's simply awful and your intellect is weak. END
BEGIN NOW Down the street as I was drifting with the city's human tide, END
BEGIN NOW Came a ghost, and for a moment walked in silence by my side -- END
BEGIN NOW Now my heart was hard and bitter, and a bitter spirit he, END
BEGIN NOW So I felt no great aversion to his ghostly company. END

BEGIN NOW Lest unfriendly heels above you grind your fingers from the rung; END
BEGIN NOW And the banter of the critic hurts his heart till it grows hard. END
BEGIN NOW At the fame your muse may offer let your lip in scorn be curled, END
BEGIN NOW Then he ceased and looked intently in my face, and nearer drew; END
BEGIN NOW But a sudden deep repugnance to his presence thrilled me through; END
BEGIN NOW Then I felt his breath was poison, by the shuddering of my soul, END
BEGIN NOW Then I guessed his purpose evil, by his lip in sneering curled, END
BEGIN NOW And I knew he slandered mankind, by my knowledge of the world. END
BEGIN NOW But he vanished as a purer brighter presence gained my side -- END
BEGIN NOW 'Heed him not! there's truth and friendship END

BEGIN NOW To whom the suppliant queen her pray'rs address'd, END
BEGIN NOW And thus the tenor of her suit express'd: END
BEGIN NOW O Aeolus! for to thee the King of Heav'n END
BEGIN NOW The pow'r of tempests and of winds has giv'n; END
BEGIN NOW Thy force alone their fury can restrain, END
BEGIN NOW And smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main- END
BEGIN NOW A race of wand'ring slaves, abhorr'd by me, END
BEGIN NOW With prosp'rous passage cut the Tuscan sea; END
BEGIN NOW To fruitful Italy their course they steer, END
BEGIN NOW And for their vanquish'd gods design new temples there. END
BEGIN NOW Raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies; END
BEGIN NOW Sink or disperse my fatal enemies. END
BEGIN NOW Twice sev'n, the charming daughters of the main, END
BEGIN NOW Around my person wait, and bear my train: END
BEGIN NOW Succeed my wish, and second my design; END
BEGIN NOW The fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine, END
BEGIN NOW And make thee father of a happy line. END
BEGIN NOW To this the god: "'T is yours, O queen, to will END
BEGIN NOW The work which duty binds me to fulfil. END
BEGIN NOW These airy kingdoms, and this wide command, END
BEGIN NOW Are all the presents of your bounteous hand: END
BEGIN NOW Yours is my sov'reign's grace; and, as your guest, END
BEGIN NOW I sit with gods at their celestial feast; END
BEGIN NOW Raise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue; END
BEGIN NOW Dispose of empire, which I hold from you. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and hurl'd against the mountain side END
BEGIN NOW His quiv'ring spear, and all the god applied. END
BEGIN NOW The raging winds rush thro' the hollow wound, END
BEGIN NOW And dance aloft in air, and skim along the ground; END
BEGIN NOW Then, settling on the sea, the surges sweep, END
BEGIN NOW Raise liquid mountains, and disclose the deep. END
BEGIN NOW South, East, and West with mix'd confusion roar, END
BEGIN NOW And roll the foaming billows to the shore. END
BEGIN NOW The cables crack; the sailors' fearful cries END
BEGIN NOW Ascend; and sable night involves the skies; END
BEGIN NOW And heav'n itself is ravish'd from their eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue; END
BEGIN NOW Then flashing fires the transient light renew; END
BEGIN NOW The face of things a frightful image bears, END
BEGIN NOW And present death in various forms appears. END
BEGIN NOW Struck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief, END
BEGIN NOW With lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief; END
BEGIN NOW And, "Thrice and four times happy those," he cried, END
BEGIN NOW That under Ilian walls before their parents died! END
BEGIN NOW Tydides, bravest of the Grecian train! END
BEGIN NOW Why could not I by that strong arm be slain, END
BEGIN NOW And lie by noble Hector on the plain, END
BEGIN NOW Or great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields END
BEGIN NOW Where Simois rolls the bodies and the shields END
BEGIN NOW Of heroes, whose dismember'd hands yet bear END
BEGIN NOW The dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear! END
BEGIN NOW Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails, END
BEGIN NOW Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails, END
BEGIN NOW And rent the sheets; the raging billows rise, END
BEGIN NOW And mount the tossing vessels to the skies: END
BEGIN NOW Nor can the shiv'ring oars sustain the blow; END
BEGIN NOW The galley gives her side, and turns her prow; END
BEGIN NOW While those astern, descending down the steep, END
BEGIN NOW Thro' gaping waves behold the boiling deep. END
BEGIN NOW Three ships were hurried by the southern blast, END
BEGIN NOW And on the secret shelves with fury cast. END
BEGIN NOW Those hidden rocks th' Ausonian sailors knew: END
BEGIN NOW They call'd them Altars, when they rose in view, END
BEGIN NOW And show'd their spacious backs above the flood. END
BEGIN NOW Three more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood, END
BEGIN NOW Dash'd on the shallows of the moving sand, END
BEGIN NOW And in mid ocean left them moor'd aland. END
BEGIN NOW Orontes' bark, that bore the Lycian crew, END
BEGIN NOW (A horrid sight!) ev'n in the hero's view, END
BEGIN NOW From stem to stern by waves was overborne: END
BEGIN NOW The trembling pilot, from his rudder torn, END
BEGIN NOW Was headlong hurl'd; thrice round the ship was toss'd, END
BEGIN NOW Then bulg'd at once, and in the deep was lost; END
BEGIN NOW And here and there above the waves were seen END
BEGIN NOW Arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men. END
BEGIN NOW The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way, END
BEGIN NOW And suck'd thro' loosen'd planks the rushing sea. END
BEGIN NOW Ilioneus was her chief: Alethes old, END
BEGIN NOW Achates faithful, Abas young and bold, END
BEGIN NOW Endur'd not less; their ships, with gaping seams, END
BEGIN NOW Admit the deluge of the briny streams. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound END
BEGIN NOW Of raging billows breaking on the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Displeas'd, and fearing for his wat'ry reign, END
BEGIN NOW He rear'd his awful head above the main, END
BEGIN NOW Serene in majesty; then roll'd his eyes END
BEGIN NOW Around the space of earth, and seas, and skies. END
BEGIN NOW He saw the Trojan fleet dispers'd, distress'd, END
BEGIN NOW By stormy winds and wintry heav'n oppress'd. END
BEGIN NOW Full well the god his sister's envy knew, END
BEGIN NOW And what her aims and what her arts pursue. END
BEGIN NOW He summon'd Eurus and the western blast, END
BEGIN NOW And first an angry glance on both he cast; END
BEGIN NOW Then thus rebuk'd: "Audacious winds! from whence END
BEGIN NOW This bold attempt, this rebel insolence? END
BEGIN NOW Is it for you to ravage seas and land, END
BEGIN NOW Unauthoriz'd by my supreme command? END
BEGIN NOW To raise such mountains on the troubled main? END
BEGIN NOW Whom I- but first 't is fit the billows to restrain; END
BEGIN NOW And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign. END
BEGIN NOW Hence! to your lord my royal mandate bear- END
BEGIN NOW The realms of ocean and the fields of air END
BEGIN NOW Are mine, not his. By fatal lot to me END
BEGIN NOW The liquid empire fell, and trident of the sea. END
BEGIN NOW His pow'r to hollow caverns is confin'd: END
BEGIN NOW There let him reign, the jailer of the wind, END
BEGIN NOW With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call, END
BEGIN NOW And boast and bluster in his empty hall. END
BEGIN NOW He spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth'd the sea, END
BEGIN NOW Dispell'd the darkness, and restor'd the day. END
BEGIN NOW Cymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green train END
BEGIN NOW Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main, END
BEGIN NOW Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands: END
BEGIN NOW The god himself with ready trident stands, END
BEGIN NOW And opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands; END
BEGIN NOW Then heaves them off the shoals. Where'er he guides END
BEGIN NOW His finny coursers and in triumph rides, END
BEGIN NOW The waves unruffle and the sea subsides. END
BEGIN NOW As, when in tumults rise th' ignoble crowd, END
BEGIN NOW Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud; END
BEGIN NOW And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly, END
BEGIN NOW And all the rustic arms that fury can supply: END
BEGIN NOW If then some grave and pious man appear, END
BEGIN NOW They hush their noise, and lend a list'ning ear; END
BEGIN NOW He soothes with sober words their angry mood, END
BEGIN NOW And quenches their innate desire of blood: END
BEGIN NOW So, when the Father of the Flood appears, END
BEGIN NOW And o'er the seas his sov'reign trident rears, END
BEGIN NOW Their fury falls: he skims the liquid plains, END
BEGIN NOW High on his chariot, and, with loosen'd reins, END
BEGIN NOW Majestic moves along, and awful peace maintains. END
BEGIN NOW The weary Trojans ply their shatter'd oars END
BEGIN NOW To nearest land, and make the Libyan shores. END
BEGIN NOW Within a long recess there lies a bay: END
BEGIN NOW An island shades it from the rolling sea, END
BEGIN NOW And forms a port secure for ships to ride; END
BEGIN NOW Broke by the jutting land, on either side, END
BEGIN NOW In double streams the briny waters glide. END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene END
BEGIN NOW Appears above, and groves for ever green: END
BEGIN NOW A grot is form'd beneath, with mossy seats, END
BEGIN NOW To rest the Nereids, and exclude the heats. END
BEGIN NOW Down thro' the crannies of the living walls END
BEGIN NOW The crystal streams descend in murm'ring falls: END
BEGIN NOW No haulsers need to bind the vessels here, END
BEGIN NOW Nor bearded anchors; for no storms they fear. END
BEGIN NOW Sev'n ships within this happy harbor meet, END
BEGIN NOW The thin remainders of the scatter'd fleet. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojans, worn with toils, and spent with woes, END
BEGIN NOW Leap on the welcome land, and seek their wish'd repose. END
BEGIN NOW First, good Achates, with repeated strokes END
BEGIN NOW Of clashing flints, their hidden fire provokes: END
BEGIN NOW Short flame succeeds; a bed of wither'd leaves END
BEGIN NOW The dying sparkles in their fall receives: END
BEGIN NOW Caught into life, in fiery fumes they rise, END
BEGIN NOW And, fed with stronger food, invade the skies. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojans, dropping wet, or stand around END
BEGIN NOW The cheerful blaze, or lie along the ground: END
BEGIN NOW Some dry their corn, infected with the brine, END
BEGIN NOW Then grind with marbles, and prepare to dine. END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas climbs the mountain's airy brow, END
BEGIN NOW And takes a prospect of the seas below, END
BEGIN NOW If Capys thence, or Antheus he could spy, END
BEGIN NOW Or see the streamers of Caicus fly. END
BEGIN NOW No vessels were in view; but, on the plain, END
BEGIN NOW Three beamy stags command a lordly train END
BEGIN NOW Of branching heads: the more ignoble throng END
BEGIN NOW Attend their stately steps, and slowly graze along. END
BEGIN NOW He stood; and, while secure they fed below, END
BEGIN NOW He took the quiver and the trusty bow END
BEGIN NOW Achates us'd to bear: the leaders first END
BEGIN NOW He laid along, and then the vulgar pierc'd; END
BEGIN NOW Nor ceas'd his arrows, till the shady plain END
BEGIN NOW Sev'n mighty bodies with their blood distain. END
BEGIN NOW For the sev'n ships he made an equal share, END
BEGIN NOW And to the port return'd, triumphant from the war. END
BEGIN NOW The jars of gen'rous wine (Acestes' gift, END
BEGIN NOW When his Trinacrian shores the navy left) END
BEGIN NOW He set abroach, and for the feast prepar'd, END
BEGIN NOW In equal portions with the ven'son shar'd. END
BEGIN NOW Thus while he dealt it round, the pious chief END
BEGIN NOW With cheerful words allay'd the common grief: END
BEGIN NOW Endure, and conquer! Jove will soon dispose END
BEGIN NOW To future good our past and present woes. END
BEGIN NOW With me, the rocks of Scylla you have tried; END
BEGIN NOW Th' inhuman Cyclops and his den defied. END
BEGIN NOW What greater ills hereafter can you bear? END
BEGIN NOW Resume your courage and dismiss your care, END
BEGIN NOW An hour will come, with pleasure to relate END
BEGIN NOW Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate. END
BEGIN NOW Thro' various hazards and events, we move END
BEGIN NOW To Latium and the realms foredoom'd by Jove. END
BEGIN NOW Call'd to the seat (the promise of the skies) END
BEGIN NOW Where Trojan kingdoms once again may rise, END
BEGIN NOW Endure the hardships of your present state; END
BEGIN NOW Live, and reserve yourselves for better fate. END
BEGIN NOW These words he spoke, but spoke not from his heart; END
BEGIN NOW His outward smiles conceal'd his inward smart. END
BEGIN NOW The jolly crew, unmindful of the past, END
BEGIN NOW The quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste. END
BEGIN NOW Some strip the skin; some portion out the spoil; END
BEGIN NOW The limbs, yet trembling, in the caldrons boil; END
BEGIN NOW Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil. END
BEGIN NOW Stretch'd on the grassy turf, at ease they dine, END
BEGIN NOW Restore their strength with meat, and cheer their souls with END
BEGIN NOW wine. END
BEGIN NOW Their hunger thus appeas'd, their care attends END
BEGIN NOW The doubtful fortune of their absent friends: END
BEGIN NOW Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess, END
BEGIN NOW Whether to deem 'em dead, or in distress. END
BEGIN NOW Above the rest, Aeneas mourns the fate END
BEGIN NOW Of brave Orontes, and th' uncertain state END
BEGIN NOW The day, but not their sorrows, ended thus. END
BEGIN NOW When, from aloft, almighty Jove surveys END
BEGIN NOW Earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas, END
BEGIN NOW At length on Libyan realms he fix'd his eyes- END
BEGIN NOW Whom, pond'ring thus on human miseries, END
BEGIN NOW When Venus saw, she with a lowly look, END
BEGIN NOW Not free from tears, her heav'nly sire bespoke: END
BEGIN NOW O King of Gods and Men! whose awful hand END
BEGIN NOW Disperses thunder on the seas and land, END
BEGIN NOW Disposing all with absolute command; END
BEGIN NOW How could my pious son thy pow'r incense? END
BEGIN NOW Or what, alas! is vanish'd Troy's offense? END
BEGIN NOW Our hope of Italy not only lost, END
BEGIN NOW On various seas by various tempests toss'd, END
BEGIN NOW But shut from ev'ry shore, and barr'd from ev'ry coast. END
BEGIN NOW You promis'd once, a progeny divine END
BEGIN NOW Of Romans, rising from the Trojan line, END
BEGIN NOW In after times should hold the world in awe, END
BEGIN NOW And to the land and ocean give the law. END
BEGIN NOW How is your doom revers'd, which eas'd my care END
BEGIN NOW When Troy was ruin'd in that cruel war? END
BEGIN NOW Then fates to fates I could oppose; but now, END
BEGIN NOW When Fortune still pursues her former blow, END
BEGIN NOW What can I hope? What worse can still succeed? END
BEGIN NOW What end of labors has your will decreed? END
BEGIN NOW Antenor, from the midst of Grecian hosts, END
BEGIN NOW Could pass secure, and pierce th' Illyrian coasts, END
BEGIN NOW Where, rolling down the steep, Timavus raves END
BEGIN NOW And thro' nine channels disembogues his waves. END
BEGIN NOW At length he founded Padua's happy seat, END
BEGIN NOW And gave his Trojans a secure retreat; END
BEGIN NOW There fix'd their arms, and there renew'd their name, END
BEGIN NOW And there in quiet rules, and crown'd with fame. END
BEGIN NOW But we, descended from your sacred line, END
BEGIN NOW Entitled to your heav'n and rites divine, END
BEGIN NOW Are banish'd earth; and, for the wrath of one, END
BEGIN NOW Remov'd from Latium and the promis'd throne. END
BEGIN NOW Are these our scepters? these our due rewards? END
BEGIN NOW And is it thus that Jove his plighted faith regards? END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Father of th' immortal race, END
BEGIN NOW Smiling with that serene indulgent face, END
BEGIN NOW With which he drives the clouds and clears the skies, END
BEGIN NOW First gave a holy kiss; then thus replies: END
BEGIN NOW Daughter, dismiss thy fears; to thy desire END
BEGIN NOW The fates of thine are fix'd, and stand entire. END
BEGIN NOW Thou shalt behold thy wish'd Lavinian walls; END
BEGIN NOW And, ripe for heav'n, when fate Aeneas calls, END
BEGIN NOW Then shalt thou bear him up, sublime, to me: END
BEGIN NOW No councils have revers'd my firm decree. END
BEGIN NOW And, lest new fears disturb thy happy state, END
BEGIN NOW Know, I have search'd the mystic rolls of Fate: END
BEGIN NOW Thy son (nor is th' appointed season far) END
BEGIN NOW In Italy shall wage successful war, END
BEGIN NOW Shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field, END
BEGIN NOW And sov'reign laws impose, and cities build, END
BEGIN NOW Till, after ev'ry foe subdued, the sun END
BEGIN NOW Thrice thro' the signs his annual race shall run: END
BEGIN NOW This is his time prefix'd. Ascanius then, END
BEGIN NOW Now call'd Iulus, shall begin his reign. END
BEGIN NOW He thirty rolling years the crown shall wear, END
BEGIN NOW Then from Lavinium shall the seat transfer, END
BEGIN NOW And, with hard labor, Alba Longa build. END
BEGIN NOW The throne with his succession shall be fill'd END
BEGIN NOW Three hundred circuits more: then shall be seen END
BEGIN NOW Ilia the fair, a priestess and a queen, END
BEGIN NOW Who, full of Mars, in time, with kindly throes, END
BEGIN NOW Shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose. END
BEGIN NOW The royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain: END
BEGIN NOW Then Romulus his grandsire's throne shall gain, END
BEGIN NOW Of martial tow'rs the founder shall become, END
BEGIN NOW The people Romans call, the city Rome. END
BEGIN NOW To them no bounds of empire I assign, END
BEGIN NOW Nor term of years to their immortal line. END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n haughty Juno, who, with endless broils, END
BEGIN NOW Earth, seas, and heav'n, and Jove himself turmoils; END
BEGIN NOW At length aton'd, her friendly pow'r shall join, END
BEGIN NOW To cherish and advance the Trojan line. END
BEGIN NOW The subject world shall Rome's dominion own, END
BEGIN NOW And, prostrate, shall adore the nation of the gown. END
BEGIN NOW An age is ripening in revolving fate END
BEGIN NOW When Troy shall overturn the Grecian state, END
BEGIN NOW And sweet revenge her conqu'ring sons shall call, END
BEGIN NOW To crush the people that conspir'd her fall. END
BEGIN NOW Then Caesar from the Julian stock shall rise, END
BEGIN NOW Whose empire ocean, and whose fame the skies END
BEGIN NOW Alone shall bound; whom, fraught with eastern spoils, END
BEGIN NOW Our heav'n, the just reward of human toils, END
BEGIN NOW Securely shall repay with rites divine; END
BEGIN NOW And incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine. END
BEGIN NOW Then dire debate and impious war shall cease, END
BEGIN NOW And the stern age be soften'd into peace: END
BEGIN NOW Then banish'd Faith shall once again return, END
BEGIN NOW And Vestal fires in hallow'd temples burn; END
BEGIN NOW And Remus with Quirinus shall sustain END
BEGIN NOW The righteous laws, and fraud and force restrain. END
BEGIN NOW Janus himself before his fane shall wait, END
BEGIN NOW And keep the dreadful issues of his gate, END
BEGIN NOW With bolts and iron bars: within remains END
BEGIN NOW Imprison'd Fury, bound in brazen chains; END
BEGIN NOW High on a trophy rais'd, of useless arms, END
BEGIN NOW He sits, and threats the world with vain alarms. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and sent Cyllenius with command END
BEGIN NOW To free the ports, and ope the Punic land END
BEGIN NOW To Trojan guests; lest, ignorant of fate, END
BEGIN NOW The queen might force them from her town and state. END
BEGIN NOW Down from the steep of heav'n Cyllenius flies, END
BEGIN NOW And cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies. END
BEGIN NOW Soon on the Libyan shore descends the god, END
BEGIN NOW Performs his message, and displays his rod: END
BEGIN NOW The surly murmurs of the people cease; END
BEGIN NOW And, as the fates requir'd, they give the peace: END
BEGIN NOW The queen herself suspends the rigid laws, END
BEGIN NOW The Trojans pities, and protects their cause. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime, in shades of night Aeneas lies: END
BEGIN NOW Care seiz'd his soul, and sleep forsook his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW But, when the sun restor'd the cheerful day, END
BEGIN NOW He rose, the coast and country to survey, END
BEGIN NOW Anxious and eager to discover more. END
BEGIN NOW It look'd a wild uncultivated shore; END
BEGIN NOW But, whether humankind, or beasts alone END
BEGIN NOW Possess'd the new-found region, was unknown. END
BEGIN NOW Beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides: END
BEGIN NOW Tall trees surround the mountain's shady sides; END
BEGIN NOW The bending brow above a safe retreat provides. END
BEGIN NOW Arm'd with two pointed darts, he leaves his friends, END
BEGIN NOW And true Achates on his steps attends. END
BEGIN NOW Lo! in the deep recesses of the wood, END
BEGIN NOW Before his eyes his goddess mother stood: END
BEGIN NOW A huntress in her habit and her mien; END
BEGIN NOW Her dress a maid, her air confess'd a queen. END
BEGIN NOW Bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind; END
BEGIN NOW Loose was her hair, and wanton'd in the wind; END
BEGIN NOW Her hand sustain'd a bow; her quiver hung behind. END
BEGIN NOW She seem'd a virgin of the Spartan blood: END
BEGIN NOW With such array Harpalyce bestrode END
BEGIN NOW Her Thracian courser and outstripp'd the rapid flood. END
BEGIN NOW Ho, strangers! have you lately seen," she said, END
BEGIN NOW One of my sisters, like myself array'd, END
BEGIN NOW Who cross'd the lawn, or in the forest stray'd? END
BEGIN NOW A painted quiver at her back she bore; END
BEGIN NOW Varied with spots, a lynx's hide she wore; END
BEGIN NOW And at full cry pursued the tusky boar. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Venus: thus her son replied again: END
BEGIN NOW None of your sisters have we heard or seen, END
BEGIN NOW O virgin! or what other name you bear END
BEGIN NOW Above that style- O more than mortal fair! END
BEGIN NOW Your voice and mien celestial birth betray! END
BEGIN NOW If, as you seem, the sister of the day, END
BEGIN NOW Or one at least of chaste Diana's train, END
BEGIN NOW Let not an humble suppliant sue in vain; END
BEGIN NOW But tell a stranger, long in tempests toss'd, END
BEGIN NOW What earth we tread, and who commands the coast? END
BEGIN NOW Then on your name shall wretched mortals call, END
BEGIN NOW And offer'd victims at your altars fall. END
BEGIN NOW I dare not," she replied, "assume the name END
BEGIN NOW Of goddess, or celestial honors claim: END
BEGIN NOW For Tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear, END
BEGIN NOW And purple buskins o'er their ankles wear. END
BEGIN NOW Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are- END
BEGIN NOW A people rude in peace, and rough in war. END
BEGIN NOW The rising city, which from far you see, END
BEGIN NOW Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony. END
BEGIN NOW Phoenician Dido rules the growing state, END
BEGIN NOW Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother's hate. END
BEGIN NOW Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate; END
BEGIN NOW Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known END
BEGIN NOW For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne, END
BEGIN NOW Possess'd fair Dido's bed; and either heart END
BEGIN NOW At once was wounded with an equal dart. END
BEGIN NOW Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid; END
BEGIN NOW Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway'd: END
BEGIN NOW One who condemn'd divine and human laws. END
BEGIN NOW Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause. END
BEGIN NOW The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth, END
BEGIN NOW With steel invades his brother's life by stealth; END
BEGIN NOW Before the sacred altar made him bleed, END
BEGIN NOW And long from her conceal'd the cruel deed. END
BEGIN NOW Some tale, some new pretense, he daily coin'd, END
BEGIN NOW To soothe his sister, and delude her mind. END
BEGIN NOW At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears END
BEGIN NOW Of her unhappy lord: the specter stares, END
BEGIN NOW And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares. END
BEGIN NOW The cruel altars and his fate he tells, END
BEGIN NOW And the dire secret of his house reveals, END
BEGIN NOW Then warns the widow, with her household gods, END
BEGIN NOW To seek a refuge in remote abodes. END
BEGIN NOW Last, to support her in so long a way, END
BEGIN NOW He shows her where his hidden treasure lay. END
BEGIN NOW Admonish'd thus, and seiz'd with mortal fright, END
BEGIN NOW The queen provides companions of her flight: END
BEGIN NOW They meet, and all combine to leave the state, END
BEGIN NOW Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate. END
BEGIN NOW They seize a fleet, which ready rigg'd they find; END
BEGIN NOW Nor is Pygmalion's treasure left behind. END
BEGIN NOW The vessels, heavy laden, put to sea END
BEGIN NOW With prosp'rous winds; a woman leads the way. END
BEGIN NOW I know not, if by stress of weather driv'n, END
BEGIN NOW Or was their fatal course dispos'd by Heav'n; END
BEGIN NOW At last they landed, where from far your eyes END
BEGIN NOW May view the turrets of new Carthage rise; END
BEGIN NOW There bought a space of ground, which (Byrsa call'd, END
BEGIN NOW From the bull's hide) they first inclos'd, and wall'd. END
BEGIN NOW But whence are you? what country claims your birth? END
BEGIN NOW What seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth? END
BEGIN NOW To whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes, END
BEGIN NOW And deeply sighing, thus her son replies: END
BEGIN NOW Could you with patience hear, or I relate, END
BEGIN NOW O nymph, the tedious annals of our fate! END
BEGIN NOW Thro' such a train of woes if I should run, END
BEGIN NOW The day would sooner than the tale be done! END
BEGIN NOW From ancient Troy, by force expell'd, we came- END
BEGIN NOW If you by chance have heard the Trojan name. END
BEGIN NOW On various seas by various tempests toss'd, END
BEGIN NOW At length we landed on your Libyan coast. END
BEGIN NOW The good Aeneas am I call'd- a name, END
BEGIN NOW While Fortune favor'd, not unknown to fame. END
BEGIN NOW My household gods, companions of my woes, END
BEGIN NOW With pious care I rescued from our foes. END
BEGIN NOW To fruitful Italy my course was bent; END
BEGIN NOW And from the King of Heav'n is my descent. END
BEGIN NOW With twice ten sail I cross'd the Phrygian sea; END
BEGIN NOW Fate and my mother goddess led my way. END
BEGIN NOW Scarce sev'n, the thin remainders of my fleet, END
BEGIN NOW From storms preserv'd, within your harbor meet. END
BEGIN NOW Myself distress'd, an exile, and unknown, END
BEGIN NOW Debarr'd from Europe, and from Asia thrown, END
BEGIN NOW In Libyan desarts wander thus alone. END
BEGIN NOW His tender parent could no longer bear; END
BEGIN NOW But, interposing, sought to soothe his care. END
BEGIN NOW Whoe'er you are- not unbelov'd by Heav'n, END
BEGIN NOW Since on our friendly shore your ships are driv'n- END
BEGIN NOW Have courage: to the gods permit the rest, END
BEGIN NOW And to the queen expose your just request. END
BEGIN NOW Now take this earnest of success, for more: END
BEGIN NOW Your scatter'd fleet is join'd upon the shore; END
BEGIN NOW The winds are chang'd, your friends from danger free; END
BEGIN NOW Or I renounce my skill in augury. END
BEGIN NOW Twelve swans behold in beauteous order move, END
BEGIN NOW And stoop with closing pinions from above; END
BEGIN NOW Whom late the bird of Jove had driv'n along, END
BEGIN NOW And thro' the clouds pursued the scatt'ring throng: END
BEGIN NOW Now, all united in a goodly team, END
BEGIN NOW They skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream. END
BEGIN NOW As they, with joy returning, clap their wings, END
BEGIN NOW And ride the circuit of the skies in rings; END
BEGIN NOW Not otherwise your ships, and ev'ry friend, END
BEGIN NOW Already hold the port, or with swift sails descend. END
BEGIN NOW No more advice is needful; but pursue END
BEGIN NOW The path before you, and the town in view. END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, she turn'd, and made appear END
BEGIN NOW Her neck refulgent, and dishevel'd hair, END
BEGIN NOW Which, flowing from her shoulders, reach'd the ground. END
BEGIN NOW And widely spread ambrosial scents around: END
BEGIN NOW In length of train descends her sweeping gown; END
BEGIN NOW And, by her graceful walk, the Queen of Love is known. END
BEGIN NOW The prince pursued the parting deity END
BEGIN NOW With words like these: "Ah! whither do you fly? END
BEGIN NOW Unkind and cruel! to deceive your son END
BEGIN NOW In borrow'd shapes, and his embrace to shun; END
BEGIN NOW Never to bless my sight, but thus unknown; END
BEGIN NOW And still to speak in accents not your own. END
BEGIN NOW Against the goddess these complaints he made, END
BEGIN NOW But took the path, and her commands obey'd. END
BEGIN NOW They march, obscure; for Venus kindly shrouds END
BEGIN NOW With mists their persons, and involves in clouds, END
BEGIN NOW That, thus unseen, their passage none might stay, END
BEGIN NOW Or force to tell the causes of their way. END
BEGIN NOW This part perform'd, the goddess flies sublime END
BEGIN NOW To visit Paphos and her native clime; END
BEGIN NOW Where garlands, ever green and ever fair, END
BEGIN NOW With vows are offer'd, and with solemn pray'r: END
BEGIN NOW A hundred altars in her temple smoke; END
BEGIN NOW A thousand bleeding hearts her pow'r invoke. END
BEGIN NOW They climb the next ascent, and, looking down, END
BEGIN NOW Now at a nearer distance view the town. END
BEGIN NOW The prince with wonder sees the stately tow'rs, END
BEGIN NOW Which late were huts and shepherds' homely bow'rs, END
BEGIN NOW The gates and streets; and hears, from ev'ry part, END
BEGIN NOW The noise and busy concourse of the mart. END
BEGIN NOW The toiling Tyrians on each other call END
BEGIN NOW To ply their labor: some extend the wall; END
BEGIN NOW Some build the citadel; the brawny throng END
BEGIN NOW Or dig, or push unwieldly stones along. END
BEGIN NOW Some for their dwellings choose a spot of ground, END
BEGIN NOW Which, first design'd, with ditches they surround. END
BEGIN NOW Some laws ordain; and some attend the choice END
BEGIN NOW Of holy senates, and elect by voice. END
BEGIN NOW Here some design a mole, while others there END
BEGIN NOW Lay deep foundations for a theater; END
BEGIN NOW From marble quarries mighty columns hew, END
BEGIN NOW For ornaments of scenes, and future view. END
BEGIN NOW Such is their toil, and such their busy pains, END
BEGIN NOW As exercise the bees in flow'ry plains, END
BEGIN NOW When winter past, and summer scarce begun, END
BEGIN NOW Invites them forth to labor in the sun; END
BEGIN NOW Some lead their youth abroad, while some condense END
BEGIN NOW Their liquid store, and some in cells dispense; END
BEGIN NOW Some at the gate stand ready to receive END
BEGIN NOW The golden burthen, and their friends relieve; END
BEGIN NOW All with united force, combine to drive END
BEGIN NOW The lazy drones from the laborious hive: END
BEGIN NOW With envy stung, they view each other's deeds; END
BEGIN NOW The fragrant work with diligence proceeds. END
BEGIN NOW Thrice happy you, whose walls already rise! END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas said, and view'd, with lifted eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Their lofty tow'rs; then, entiring at the gate, END
BEGIN NOW Conceal'd in clouds (prodigious to relate) END
BEGIN NOW He mix'd, unmark'd, among the busy throng, END
BEGIN NOW Borne by the tide, and pass'd unseen along. END
BEGIN NOW Full in the center of the town there stood, END
BEGIN NOW Thick set with trees, a venerable wood. END
BEGIN NOW The Tyrians, landing near this holy ground, END
BEGIN NOW And digging here, a prosp'rous omen found: END
BEGIN NOW From under earth a courser's head they drew, END
BEGIN NOW Their growth and future fortune to foreshew. END
BEGIN NOW This fated sign their foundress Juno gave, END
BEGIN NOW Of a soil fruitful, and a people brave. END
BEGIN NOW Sidonian Dido here with solemn state END
BEGIN NOW Did Juno's temple build, and consecrate, END
BEGIN NOW Enrich'd with gifts, and with a golden shrine; END
BEGIN NOW But more the goddess made the place divine. END
BEGIN NOW On brazen steps the marble threshold rose, END
BEGIN NOW And brazen plates the cedar beams inclose: END
BEGIN NOW The rafters are with brazen cov'rings crown'd; END
BEGIN NOW The lofty doors on brazen hinges sound. END
BEGIN NOW What first Aeneas this place beheld, END
BEGIN NOW Reviv'd his courage, and his fear expell'd. END
BEGIN NOW For while, expecting there the queen, he rais'd END
BEGIN NOW His wond'ring eyes, and round the temple gaz'd, END
BEGIN NOW Admir'd the fortune of the rising town, END
BEGIN NOW The striving artists, and their arts' renown; END
BEGIN NOW He saw, in order painted on the wall, END
BEGIN NOW Whatever did unhappy Troy befall: END
BEGIN NOW The wars that fame around the world had blown, END
BEGIN NOW All to the life, and ev'ry leader known. END
BEGIN NOW There Agamemnon, Priam here, he spies, END
BEGIN NOW And fierce Achilles, who both kings defies. END
BEGIN NOW He stopp'd, and weeping said: "O friend! ev'n here END
BEGIN NOW The monuments of Trojan woes appear! END
BEGIN NOW Our known disasters fill ev'n foreign lands: END
BEGIN NOW See there, where old unhappy Priam stands! END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n the mute walls relate the warrior's fame, END
BEGIN NOW And Trojan griefs the Tyrians' pity claim. END
BEGIN NOW He said (his tears a ready passage find), END
BEGIN NOW Devouring what he saw so well design'd, END
BEGIN NOW And with an empty picture fed his mind: END
BEGIN NOW For there he saw the fainting Grecians yield, END
BEGIN NOW And here the trembling Trojans quit the field, END
BEGIN NOW Pursued by fierce Achilles thro' the plain, END
BEGIN NOW On his high chariot driving o'er the slain. END
BEGIN NOW The tents of Rhesus next his grief renew, END
BEGIN NOW By their white sails betray'd to nightly view; END
BEGIN NOW And wakeful Diomede, whose cruel sword END
BEGIN NOW The sentries slew, nor spar'd their slumb'ring lord, END
BEGIN NOW Then took the fiery steeds, ere yet the food END
BEGIN NOW Of Troy they taste, or drink the Xanthian flood. END
BEGIN NOW Elsewhere he saw where Troilus defied END
BEGIN NOW Achilles, and unequal combat tried; END
BEGIN NOW Then, where the boy disarm'd, with loosen'd reins, END
BEGIN NOW Was by his horses hurried o'er the plains, END
BEGIN NOW Hung by the neck and hair, and dragg'd around: END
BEGIN NOW The hostile spear, yet sticking in his wound, END
BEGIN NOW With tracks of blood inscrib'd the dusty ground. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime the Trojan dames, oppress'd with woe, END
BEGIN NOW To Pallas' fane in long procession go, END
BEGIN NOW In hopes to reconcile their heav'nly foe. END
BEGIN NOW They weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their hair, END
BEGIN NOW And rich embroider'd vests for presents bear; END
BEGIN NOW But the stern goddess stands unmov'd with pray'r. END
BEGIN NOW Thrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew END
BEGIN NOW The corpse of Hector, whom in fight he slew. END
BEGIN NOW Here Priam sues; and there, for sums of gold, END
BEGIN NOW The lifeless body of his son is sold. END
BEGIN NOW So sad an object, and so well express'd, END
BEGIN NOW Drew sighs and groans from the griev'd hero's breast, END
BEGIN NOW To see the figure of his lifeless friend, END
BEGIN NOW And his old sire his helpless hand extend. END
BEGIN NOW Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train, END
BEGIN NOW Mix'd in the bloody battle on the plain; END
BEGIN NOW And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew, END
BEGIN NOW His pompous ensigns, and his Indian crew. END
BEGIN NOW Penthisilea there, with haughty grace, END
BEGIN NOW Leads to the wars an Amazonian race: END
BEGIN NOW In their right hands a pointed dart they wield; END
BEGIN NOW The left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield. END
BEGIN NOW Athwart her breast a golden belt she throws, END
BEGIN NOW Amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes, END
BEGIN NOW And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose. END
BEGIN NOW Thus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Fix'd on the walls with wonder and surprise, END
BEGIN NOW The beauteous Dido, with a num'rous train END
BEGIN NOW And pomp of guards, ascends the sacred fane. END
BEGIN NOW Such on Eurotas' banks, or Cynthus' height, END
BEGIN NOW Diana seems; and so she charms the sight, END
BEGIN NOW When in the dance the graceful goddess leads END
BEGIN NOW The choir of nymphs, and overtops their heads: END
BEGIN NOW Known by her quiver, and her lofty mien, END
BEGIN NOW She walks majestic, and she looks their queen; END
BEGIN NOW Latona sees her shine above the rest, END
BEGIN NOW And feeds with secret joy her silent breast. END
BEGIN NOW Such Dido was; with such becoming state, END
BEGIN NOW Amidst the crowd, she walks serenely great. END
BEGIN NOW Their labor to her future sway she speeds, END
BEGIN NOW And passing with a gracious glance proceeds; END
BEGIN NOW Then mounts the throne, high plac'd before the shrine: END
BEGIN NOW In crowds around, the swarming people join. END
BEGIN NOW She takes petitions, and dispenses laws, END
BEGIN NOW Hears and determines ev'ry private cause; END
BEGIN NOW Their tasks in equal portions she divides, END
BEGIN NOW And, where unequal, there by lots decides. END
BEGIN NOW Another way by chance Aeneas bends END
BEGIN NOW His eyes, and unexpected sees his friends, END
BEGIN NOW Antheus, Sergestus grave, Cloanthus strong, END
BEGIN NOW And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng, END
BEGIN NOW Whom late the tempest on the billows toss'd, END
BEGIN NOW And widely scatter'd on another coast. END
BEGIN NOW The prince, unseen, surpris'd with wonder stands, END
BEGIN NOW And longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands; END
BEGIN NOW But, doubtful of the wish'd event, he stays, END
BEGIN NOW And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys, END
BEGIN NOW Impatient till they told their present state, END
BEGIN NOW And where they left their ships, and what their fate, END
BEGIN NOW And why they came, and what was their request; END
BEGIN NOW For these were sent, commission'd by the rest, END
BEGIN NOW To sue for leave to land their sickly men, END
BEGIN NOW And gain admission to the gracious queen. END
BEGIN NOW Ent'ring, with cries they fill'd the holy fane; END
BEGIN NOW Then thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began: END
BEGIN NOW O queen! indulg'd by favor of the gods END
BEGIN NOW To found an empire in these new abodes, END
BEGIN NOW To build a town, with statutes to restrain END
BEGIN NOW The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign, END
BEGIN NOW We wretched Trojans, toss'd on ev'ry shore, END
BEGIN NOW From sea to sea, thy clemency implore. END
BEGIN NOW Forbid the fires our shipping to deface! END
BEGIN NOW Receive th' unhappy fugitives to grace, END
BEGIN NOW And spare the remnant of a pious race! END
BEGIN NOW We come not with design of wasteful prey, END
BEGIN NOW To drive the country, force the swains away: END
BEGIN NOW Nor such our strength, nor such is our desire; END
BEGIN NOW The vanquish'd dare not to such thoughts aspire. END
BEGIN NOW A land there is, Hesperia nam'd of old; END
BEGIN NOW The soil is fruitful, and the men are bold- END
BEGIN NOW Th' Oenotrians held it once- by common fame END
BEGIN NOW Now call'd Italia, from the leader's name. END
BEGIN NOW To that sweet region was our voyage bent, END
BEGIN NOW When winds and ev'ry warring element END
BEGIN NOW Disturb'd our course, and, far from sight of land, END
BEGIN NOW Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand: END
BEGIN NOW The sea came on; the South, with mighty roar, END
BEGIN NOW Dispers'd and dash'd the rest upon the rocky shore. END
BEGIN NOW Those few you see escap'd the Storm, and fear, END
BEGIN NOW Unless you interpose, a shipwreck here. END
BEGIN NOW What men, what monsters, what inhuman race, END
BEGIN NOW What laws, what barb'rous customs of the place, END
BEGIN NOW Shut up a desart shore to drowning men, END
BEGIN NOW And drive us to the cruel seas again? END
BEGIN NOW If our hard fortune no compassion draws, END
BEGIN NOW Nor hospitable rights, nor human laws, END
BEGIN NOW The gods are just, and will revenge our cause. END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas was our prince: a juster lord, END
BEGIN NOW Or nobler warrior, never drew a sword; END
BEGIN NOW Observant of the right, religious of his word. END
BEGIN NOW If yet he lives, and draws this vital air, END
BEGIN NOW Nor we, his friends, of safety shall despair; END
BEGIN NOW Nor you, great queen, these offices repent, END
BEGIN NOW Which he will equal, and perhaps augment. END
BEGIN NOW We want not cities, nor Sicilian coasts, END
BEGIN NOW Where King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts. END
BEGIN NOW Permit our ships a shelter on your shores, END
BEGIN NOW Refitted from your woods with planks and oars, END
BEGIN NOW That, if our prince be safe, we may renew END
BEGIN NOW Our destin'd course, and Italy pursue. END
BEGIN NOW But if, O best of men, the Fates ordain END
BEGIN NOW That thou art swallow'd in the Libyan main, END
BEGIN NOW And if our young Iulus be no more, END
BEGIN NOW Dismiss our navy from your friendly shore, END
BEGIN NOW That we to good Acestes may return, END
BEGIN NOW And with our friends our common losses mourn. END
BEGIN NOW Thus spoke Ilioneus: the Trojan crew END
BEGIN NOW With cries and clamors his request renew. END
BEGIN NOW The modest queen a while, with downcast eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Ponder'd the speech; then briefly thus replies: END
BEGIN NOW Trojans, dismiss your fears; my cruel fate, END
BEGIN NOW And doubts attending an unsettled state, END
BEGIN NOW Force me to guard my coast from foreign foes. END
BEGIN NOW Who has not heard the story of your woes, END
BEGIN NOW The name and fortune of your native place, END
BEGIN NOW The fame and valor of the Phrygian race? END
BEGIN NOW We Tyrians are not so devoid of sense, END
BEGIN NOW Nor so remote from Phoebus' influence. END
BEGIN NOW Whether to Latian shores your course is bent, END
BEGIN NOW Or, driv'n by tempests from your first intent, END
BEGIN NOW You seek the good Acestes' government, END
BEGIN NOW Your men shall be receiv'd, your fleet repair'd, END
BEGIN NOW And sail, with ships of convoy for your guard: END
BEGIN NOW Or, would you stay, and join your friendly pow'rs END
BEGIN NOW To raise and to defend the Tyrian tow'rs, END
BEGIN NOW My wealth, my city, and myself are yours. END
BEGIN NOW And would to Heav'n, the Storm, you felt, would bring END
BEGIN NOW On Carthaginian coasts your wand'ring king. END
BEGIN NOW My people shall, by my command, explore END
BEGIN NOW The ports and creeks of ev'ry winding shore, END
BEGIN NOW And towns, and wilds, and shady woods, in quest END
BEGIN NOW Of so renown'd and so desir'd a guest. END
BEGIN NOW Rais'd in his mind the Trojan hero stood, END
BEGIN NOW And long'd to break from out his ambient cloud: END
BEGIN NOW Achates found it, and thus urg'd his way: END
BEGIN NOW From whence, O goddess-born, this long delay? END
BEGIN NOW What more can you desire, your welcome sure, END
BEGIN NOW Your fleet in safety, and your friends secure? END
BEGIN NOW One only wants; and him we saw in vain END
BEGIN NOW Oppose the Storm, and swallow'd in the main. END
BEGIN NOW Orontes in his fate our forfeit paid; END
BEGIN NOW The rest agrees with what your mother said. END
BEGIN NOW Scarce had he spoken, when the cloud gave way, END
BEGIN NOW The mists flew upward and dissolv'd in day. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan chief appear'd in open sight, END
BEGIN NOW August in visage, and serenely bright. END
BEGIN NOW His mother goddess, with her hands divine, END
BEGIN NOW Had form'd his curling locks, and made his temples shine, END
BEGIN NOW And giv'n his rolling eyes a sparkling grace, END
BEGIN NOW And breath'd a youthful vigor on his face; END
BEGIN NOW Like polish'd ivory, beauteous to behold, END
BEGIN NOW Or Parian marble, when enchas'd in gold: END
BEGIN NOW Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke, END
BEGIN NOW And thus with manly modesty he spoke: END
BEGIN NOW He whom you seek am I; by tempests toss'd, END
BEGIN NOW And sav'd from shipwreck on your Libyan coast; END
BEGIN NOW Presenting, gracious queen, before your throne, END
BEGIN NOW A prince that owes his life to you alone. END
BEGIN NOW Fair majesty, the refuge and redress END
BEGIN NOW Of those whom fate pursues, and wants oppress, END
BEGIN NOW You, who your pious offices employ END
BEGIN NOW To save the relics of abandon'd Troy; END
BEGIN NOW Receive the shipwreck'd on your friendly shore, END
BEGIN NOW With hospitable rites relieve the poor; END
BEGIN NOW Associate in your town a wand'ring train, END
BEGIN NOW And strangers in your palace entertain: END
BEGIN NOW What thanks can wretched fugitives return, END
BEGIN NOW Who, scatter'd thro' the world, in exile mourn? END
BEGIN NOW The gods, if gods to goodness are inclin'd; END
BEGIN NOW If acts of mercy touch their heav'nly mind, END
BEGIN NOW And, more than all the gods, your gen'rous heart. END
BEGIN NOW Conscious of worth, requite its own desert! END
BEGIN NOW In you this age is happy, and this earth, END
BEGIN NOW And parents more than mortal gave you birth. END
BEGIN NOW While rolling rivers into seas shall run, END
BEGIN NOW And round the space of heav'n the radiant sun; END
BEGIN NOW While trees the mountain tops with shades supply, END
BEGIN NOW Your honor, name, and praise shall never die. END
BEGIN NOW Whate'er abode my fortune has assign'd, END
BEGIN NOW Your image shall be present in my mind. END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, he turn'd with pious haste, END
BEGIN NOW And joyful his expecting friends embrac'd: END
BEGIN NOW With his right hand Ilioneus was grac'd, END
BEGIN NOW Serestus with his left; then to his breast END
BEGIN NOW Cloanthus and the noble Gyas press'd; END
BEGIN NOW And so by turns descended to the rest. END
BEGIN NOW The Tyrian queen stood fix'd upon his face, END
BEGIN NOW Pleas'd with his motions, ravish'd with his grace; END
BEGIN NOW Admir'd his fortunes, more admir'd the man; END
BEGIN NOW Then recollected stood, and thus began: END
BEGIN NOW What fate, O goddess-born; what angry pow'rs END
BEGIN NOW Have cast you shipwrack'd on our barren shores? END
BEGIN NOW Are you the great Aeneas, known to fame, END
BEGIN NOW Who from celestial seed your lineage claim? END
BEGIN NOW The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore END
BEGIN NOW To fam'd Anchises on th' Idaean shore? END
BEGIN NOW It calls into my mind, tho' then a child, END
BEGIN NOW When Teucer came, from Salamis exil'd, END
BEGIN NOW And sought my father's aid, to be restor'd: END
BEGIN NOW My father Belus then with fire and sword END
BEGIN NOW Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare, END
BEGIN NOW And, conqu'ring, finish'd the successful war. END
BEGIN NOW From him the Trojan siege I understood, END
BEGIN NOW The Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood. END
BEGIN NOW Your foe himself the Dardan valor prais'd, END
BEGIN NOW And his own ancestry from Trojans rais'd. END
BEGIN NOW Enter, my noble guest, and you shall find, END
BEGIN NOW If not a costly welcome, yet a kind: END
BEGIN NOW For I myself, like you, have been distress'd, END
BEGIN NOW Till Heav'n afforded me this place of rest; END
BEGIN NOW Like you, an alien in a land unknown, END
BEGIN NOW I learn to pity woes so like my own. END
BEGIN NOW She said, and to the palace led her guest; END
BEGIN NOW Then offer'd incense, and proclaim'd a feast. END
BEGIN NOW Nor yet less careful for her absent friends, END
BEGIN NOW Twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends; END
BEGIN NOW Besides a hundred boars, a hundred lambs, END
BEGIN NOW With bleating cries, attend their milky dams; END
BEGIN NOW And jars of gen'rous wine and spacious bowls END
BEGIN NOW She gives, to cheer the sailors' drooping souls. END
BEGIN NOW Now purple hangings clothe the palace walls, END
BEGIN NOW And sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls: END
BEGIN NOW On Tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they dine; END
BEGIN NOW With loads of massy plate the sideboards shine, END
BEGIN NOW And antique vases, all of gold emboss'd END
BEGIN NOW (The gold itself inferior to the cost), END
BEGIN NOW Of curious work, where on the sides were seen END
BEGIN NOW The fights and figures of illustrious men, END
BEGIN NOW From their first founder to the present queen. END
BEGIN NOW The good Aeneas, paternal care END
BEGIN NOW Iulus' absence could no longer bear, END
BEGIN NOW Dispatch'd Achates to the ships in haste, END
BEGIN NOW To give a glad relation of the past, END
BEGIN NOW And, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy, END
BEGIN NOW Snatch'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy: END
BEGIN NOW A robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire; END
BEGIN NOW An upper vest, once Helen's rich attire, END
BEGIN NOW From Argos by the fam'd adultress brought, END
BEGIN NOW With golden flow'rs and winding foliage wrought, END
BEGIN NOW Her mother Leda's present, when she came END
BEGIN NOW To ruin Troy and set the world on flame; END
BEGIN NOW The scepter Priam's eldest daughter bore, END
BEGIN NOW Her orient necklace, and the crown she wore END
BEGIN NOW Of double texture, glorious to behold, END
BEGIN NOW One order set with gems, and one with gold. END
BEGIN NOW Instructed thus, the wise Achates goes, END
BEGIN NOW And in his diligence his duty shows. END
BEGIN NOW But Venus, anxious for her son's affairs, END
BEGIN NOW New counsels tries, and new designs prepares: END
BEGIN NOW That Cupid should assume the shape and face END
BEGIN NOW Of sweet Ascanius, and the sprightly grace; END
BEGIN NOW Should bring the presents, in her nephew's stead, END
BEGIN NOW And in Eliza's veins the gentle poison shed: END
BEGIN NOW For much she fear'd the Tyrians, double-tongued, END
BEGIN NOW And knew the town to Juno's care belong'd. END
BEGIN NOW These thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke, END
BEGIN NOW And thus alarm'd, to winged Love she spoke: END
BEGIN NOW My son, my strength, whose mighty pow'r alone END
BEGIN NOW Controls the Thund'rer on his awful throne, END
BEGIN NOW To thee thy much-afflicted mother flies, END
BEGIN NOW And on thy succor and thy faith relies. END
BEGIN NOW Thou know'st, my son, how Jove's revengeful wife, END
BEGIN NOW By force and fraud, attempts thy brother's life; END
BEGIN NOW And often hast thou mourn'd with me his pains. END
BEGIN NOW Him Dido now with blandishment detains; END
BEGIN NOW But I suspect the town where Juno reigns. END
BEGIN NOW For this 't is needful to prevent her art, END
BEGIN NOW And fire with love the proud Phoenician's heart: END
BEGIN NOW A love so violent, so strong, so sure, END
BEGIN NOW As neither age can change, nor art can cure. END
BEGIN NOW How this may be perform'd, now take my mind: END
BEGIN NOW Ascanius by his father is design'd END
BEGIN NOW To come, with presents laden, from the port, END
BEGIN NOW To gratify the queen, and gain the court. END
BEGIN NOW I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep, END
BEGIN NOW And, ravish'd, in Idalian bow'rs to keep, END
BEGIN NOW Or high Cythera, that the sweet deceit END
BEGIN NOW May pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat. END
BEGIN NOW Take thou his form and shape. I beg the grace END
BEGIN NOW But only for a night's revolving space: END
BEGIN NOW Thyself a boy, assume a boy's dissembled face; END
BEGIN NOW That when, amidst the fervor of the feast, END
BEGIN NOW The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast, END
BEGIN NOW And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains, END
BEGIN NOW Thou may'st infuse thy venom in her veins. END
BEGIN NOW The God of Love obeys, and sets aside END
BEGIN NOW His bow and quiver, and his plumy pride; END
BEGIN NOW He walks Iulus in his mother's sight, END
BEGIN NOW And in the sweet resemblance takes delight. END
BEGIN NOW The goddess then to young Ascanius flies, END
BEGIN NOW And in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes: END
BEGIN NOW Lull'd in her lap, amidst a train of Loves, END
BEGIN NOW She gently bears him to her blissful groves, END
BEGIN NOW Then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head, END
BEGIN NOW And softly lays him on a flow'ry bed. END
BEGIN NOW Cupid meantime assum'd his form and face, END
BEGIN NOW Foll'wing Achates with a shorter pace, END
BEGIN NOW And brought the gifts. The queen already sate END
BEGIN NOW Amidst the Trojan lords, in shining state, END
BEGIN NOW High on a golden bed: her princely guest END
BEGIN NOW Was next her side; in order sate the rest. END
BEGIN NOW Then canisters with bread are heap'd on high; END
BEGIN NOW Th' attendants water for their hands supply, END
BEGIN NOW And, having wash'd, with silken towels dry. END
BEGIN NOW Next fifty handmaids in long order bore END
BEGIN NOW The censers, and with fumes the gods adore: END
BEGIN NOW Then youths, and virgins twice as many, join END
BEGIN NOW To place the dishes, and to serve the wine. END
BEGIN NOW The Tyrian train, admitted to the feast, END
BEGIN NOW Approach, and on the painted couches rest. END
BEGIN NOW All on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze, END
BEGIN NOW But view the beauteous boy with more amaze, END
BEGIN NOW His rosy-color'd cheeks, his radiant eyes, END
BEGIN NOW His motions, voice, and shape, and all the god's disguise; END
BEGIN NOW Nor pass unprais'd the vest and veil divine, END
BEGIN NOW Which wand'ring foliage and rich flow'rs entwine. END
BEGIN NOW But, far above the rest, the royal dame, END
BEGIN NOW (Already doom'd to love's disastrous flame,) END
BEGIN NOW With eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy, END
BEGIN NOW Beholds the presents, and admires the boy. END
BEGIN NOW The guileful god about the hero long, END
BEGIN NOW With children's play, and false embraces, hung; END
BEGIN NOW Then sought the queen: she took him to her arms END
BEGIN NOW With greedy pleasure, and devour'd his charms. END
BEGIN NOW Unhappy Dido little thought what guest, END
BEGIN NOW How dire a god, she drew so near her breast; END
BEGIN NOW But he, not mindless of his mother's pray'r, END
BEGIN NOW Works in the pliant bosom of the fair, END
BEGIN NOW And molds her heart anew, and blots her former care. END
BEGIN NOW The dead is to the living love resign'd; END
BEGIN NOW And all Aeneas enters in her mind. END
BEGIN NOW Now, when the rage of hunger was appeas'd, END
BEGIN NOW The meat remov'd, and ev'ry guest was pleas'd, END
BEGIN NOW The golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown'd, END
BEGIN NOW And thro' the palace cheerful cries resound. END
BEGIN NOW From gilded roofs depending lamps display END
BEGIN NOW Nocturnal beams, that emulate the day. END
BEGIN NOW A golden bowl, that shone with gems divine, END
BEGIN NOW The queen commanded to be crown'd with wine: END
BEGIN NOW The bowl that Belus us'd, and all the Tyrian line. END
BEGIN NOW Then, silence thro' the hall proclaim'd, she spoke: END
BEGIN NOW O hospitable Jove! we thus invoke, END
BEGIN NOW With solemn rites, thy sacred name and pow'r; END
BEGIN NOW Bless to both nations this auspicious hour! END
BEGIN NOW So may the Trojan and the Tyrian line END
BEGIN NOW In lasting concord from this day combine. END
BEGIN NOW Thou, Bacchus, god of joys and friendly cheer, END
BEGIN NOW And gracious Juno, both be present here! END
BEGIN NOW And you, my lords of Tyre, your vows address END
BEGIN NOW To Heav'n with mine, to ratify the peace. END
BEGIN NOW The goblet then she took, with nectar crown'd END
BEGIN NOW (Sprinkling the first libations on the ground,) END
BEGIN NOW And rais'd it to her mouth with sober grace; END
BEGIN NOW Then, sipping, offer'd to the next in place. END
BEGIN NOW 'T was Bitias whom she call'd, a thirsty soul; END
BEGIN NOW He took challenge, and embrac'd the bowl, END
BEGIN NOW With pleasure swill'd the gold, nor ceas'd to draw, END
BEGIN NOW Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw. END
BEGIN NOW The goblet goes around: Iopas brought END
BEGIN NOW His golden lyre, and sung what ancient Atlas taught: END
BEGIN NOW The various labors of the wand'ring moon, END
BEGIN NOW And whence proceed th' eclipses of the sun; END
BEGIN NOW Th' original of men and beasts; and whence END
BEGIN NOW The rains arise, and fires their warmth dispense, END
BEGIN NOW And fix'd and erring stars dispose their influence; END
BEGIN NOW What shakes the solid earth; what cause delays END
BEGIN NOW The summer nights and shortens winter days. END
BEGIN NOW With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song: END
BEGIN NOW Those peals are echo'd by the Trojan throng. END
BEGIN NOW Th' unhappy queen with talk prolong'd the night, END
BEGIN NOW And drank large draughts of love with vast delight; END
BEGIN NOW Of Priam much enquir'd, of Hector more; END
BEGIN NOW Then ask'd what arms the swarthy Memnon wore, END
BEGIN NOW What troops he landed on the Trojan shore; END
BEGIN NOW The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse, END
BEGIN NOW And fierce Achilles, with his matchless force; END
BEGIN NOW At length, as fate and her ill stars requir'd, END
BEGIN NOW To hear the series of the war desir'd. END
BEGIN NOW Relate at large, my godlike guest," she said, END
BEGIN NOW The Grecian stratagems, the town betray'd: END
BEGIN NOW The fatal issue of so long a war, END
BEGIN NOW Your flight, your wand'rings, and your woes, declare; END
BEGIN NOW For, since on ev'ry sea, on ev'ry coast, END
BEGIN NOW Your men have been distress'd, your navy toss'd, END
BEGIN NOW Sev'n times the sun has either tropic view'd, END
BEGIN NOW The winter banish'd, and the spring renew'd. END
BEGIN NOW All were attentive to the godlike man, END
BEGIN NOW When from his lofty couch he thus began: END
BEGIN NOW Great queen, what you command me to relate END
BEGIN NOW Renews the sad remembrance of our fate: END
BEGIN NOW An empire from its old foundations rent, END
BEGIN NOW And ev'ry woe the Trojans underwent; END
BEGIN NOW A peopled city made a desart place; END
BEGIN NOW All that I saw, and part of which I was: END
BEGIN NOW Not ev'n the hardest of our foes could hear, END
BEGIN NOW Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear. END
BEGIN NOW And now the latter watch of wasting night, END
BEGIN NOW And setting stars, to kindly rest invite; END
BEGIN NOW But, since you take such int'rest in our woe, END
BEGIN NOW And Troy's disastrous end desire to know, END
BEGIN NOW I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell END
BEGIN NOW What in our last and fatal night befell. END
BEGIN NOW By destiny compell'd, and in despair, END
BEGIN NOW The Greeks grew weary of the tedious war, END
BEGIN NOW And by Minerva's aid a fabric rear'd, END
BEGIN NOW Which like a steed of monstrous height appear'd: END
BEGIN NOW The sides were plank'd with pine; they feign'd it made END
BEGIN NOW For their return, and this the vow they paid. END
BEGIN NOW Thus they pretend, but in the hollow side END
BEGIN NOW Selected numbers of their soldiers hide: END
BEGIN NOW With inward arms the dire machine they load, END
BEGIN NOW And iron bowels stuff the dark abode. END
BEGIN NOW In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an isle END
BEGIN NOW (While Fortune did on Priam's empire smile) END
BEGIN NOW Renown'd for wealth; but, since, a faithless bay, END
BEGIN NOW Where ships expos'd to wind and weather lay. END
BEGIN NOW There was their fleet conceal'd. We thought, for Greece END
BEGIN NOW Their sails were hoisted, and our fears release. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojans, coop'd within their walls so long, END
BEGIN NOW Unbar their gates, and issue in a throng, END
BEGIN NOW Like swarming bees, and with delight survey END
BEGIN NOW The camp deserted, where the Grecians lay: END
BEGIN NOW The quarters of the sev'ral chiefs they show'd; END
BEGIN NOW Here Phoenix, here Achilles, made abode; END
BEGIN NOW Here join'd the battles; there the navy rode. END
BEGIN NOW Part on the pile their wond'ring eyes employ: END
BEGIN NOW The pile by Pallas rais'd to ruin Troy. END
BEGIN NOW Thymoetes first ('t is doubtful whether hir'd, END
BEGIN NOW Or so the Trojan destiny requir'd) END
BEGIN NOW Mov'd that the ramparts might be broken down, END
BEGIN NOW To lodge the monster fabric in the town. END
BEGIN NOW But Capys, and the rest of sounder mind, END
BEGIN NOW The fatal present to the flames designed, END
BEGIN NOW Or to the wat'ry deep; at least to bore END
BEGIN NOW The hollow sides, and hidden frauds explore. END
BEGIN NOW The giddy vulgar, as their fancies guide, END
BEGIN NOW With noise say nothing, and in parts divide. END
BEGIN NOW Laocoon, follow'd by a num'rous crowd, END
BEGIN NOW Ran from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud: END
BEGIN NOW 'O wretched countrymen! what fury reigns? END
BEGIN NOW What more than madness has possess'd your brains? END
BEGIN NOW Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone? END
BEGIN NOW And are Ulysses' arts no better known? END
BEGIN NOW This hollow fabric either must inclose, END
BEGIN NOW Within its blind recess, our secret foes; END
BEGIN NOW Or 't is an engine rais'd above the town, END
BEGIN NOW T' o'erlook the walls, and then to batter down. END
BEGIN NOW Somewhat is sure design'd, by fraud or force: END
BEGIN NOW Trust not their presents, nor admit the horse.' END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, against the steed he threw END
BEGIN NOW His forceful spear, which, hissing as flew, END
BEGIN NOW Pierc'd thro' the yielding planks of jointed wood, END
BEGIN NOW And trembling in the hollow belly stood. END
BEGIN NOW The sides, transpierc'd, return a rattling sound, END
BEGIN NOW And groans of Greeks inclos'd come issuing thro' the wound END
BEGIN NOW And, had not Heav'n the fall of Troy design'd, END
BEGIN NOW Or had not men been fated to be blind, END
BEGIN NOW Enough was said and done t'inspire a better mind. END
BEGIN NOW Then had our lances pierc'd the treach'rous wood, END
BEGIN NOW And Ilian tow'rs and Priam's empire stood. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring END
BEGIN NOW A captive Greek, in bands, before the king; END
BEGIN NOW Taken to take; who made himself their prey, END
BEGIN NOW T' impose on their belief, and Troy betray; END
BEGIN NOW Fix'd on his aim, and obstinately bent END
BEGIN NOW To die undaunted, or to circumvent. END
BEGIN NOW About the captive, tides of Trojans flow; END
BEGIN NOW All press to see, and some insult the foe. END
BEGIN NOW Now hear how well the Greeks their wiles disguis'd; END
BEGIN NOW Behold a nation in a man compris'd. END
BEGIN NOW Trembling the miscreant stood, unarm'd and bound; END
BEGIN NOW He star'd, and roll'd his haggard eyes around, END
BEGIN NOW Then said: 'Alas! what earth remains, what sea END
BEGIN NOW Is open to receive unhappy me? END
BEGIN NOW What fate a wretched fugitive attends, END
BEGIN NOW Scorn'd by my foes, abandon'd by my friends?' END
BEGIN NOW He said, and sigh'd, and cast a rueful eye: END
BEGIN NOW Our pity kindles, and our passions die. END
BEGIN NOW We cheer youth to make his own defense, END
BEGIN NOW And freely tell us what he was, and whence: END
BEGIN NOW What news he could impart, we long to know, END
BEGIN NOW And what to credit from a captive foe. END
BEGIN NOW His fear at length dismiss'd, he said: 'Whate'er END
BEGIN NOW My fate ordains, my words shall be sincere: END
BEGIN NOW I neither can nor dare my birth disclaim; END
BEGIN NOW Greece is my country, Sinon is my name. END
BEGIN NOW Tho' plung'd by Fortune's pow'r in misery, END
BEGIN NOW 'T is not in Fortune's pow'r to make me lie. END
BEGIN NOW If any chance has hither brought the name END
BEGIN NOW Of Palamedes, not unknown to fame, END
BEGIN NOW Who suffer'd from the malice of the times, END
BEGIN NOW Accus'd and sentenc'd for pretended crimes, END
BEGIN NOW Because these fatal wars he would prevent; END
BEGIN NOW Whose death the wretched Greeks too late lament- END
BEGIN NOW Me, then a boy, my father, poor and bare END
BEGIN NOW Of other means, committed to his care, END
BEGIN NOW His kinsman and companion in the war. END
BEGIN NOW While Fortune favor'd, while his arms support END
BEGIN NOW The cause, and rul'd the counsels, of the court, END
BEGIN NOW I made some figure there; nor was my name END
BEGIN NOW Obscure, nor I without my share of fame. END
BEGIN NOW But when Ulysses, with fallacious arts, END
BEGIN NOW Had made impression in the people's hearts, END
BEGIN NOW And forg'd a treason in my patron's name END
BEGIN NOW (I speak of things too far divulg'd by fame), END
BEGIN NOW My kinsman fell. Then I, without support, END
BEGIN NOW In private mourn'd his loss, and left the court. END
BEGIN NOW Mad as I was, I could not bear his fate END
BEGIN NOW With silent grief, but loudly blam'd the state, END
BEGIN NOW And curs'd the direful author of my woes. END
BEGIN NOW 'T was told again; and hence my ruin rose. END
BEGIN NOW I threaten'd, if indulgent Heav'n once more END
BEGIN NOW Would land me safely on my native shore, END
BEGIN NOW His death with double vengeance to restore. END
BEGIN NOW This mov'd the murderer's hate; and soon ensued END
BEGIN NOW Th' effects of malice from a man so proud. END
BEGIN NOW Ambiguous rumors thro' the camp he spread, END
BEGIN NOW And sought, by treason, my devoted head; END
BEGIN NOW New crimes invented; left unturn'd no stone, END
BEGIN NOW To make my guilt appear, and hide his own; END
BEGIN NOW Till Calchas was by force and threat'ning wrought- END
BEGIN NOW But why- why dwell I on that anxious thought? END
BEGIN NOW If on my nation just revenge you seek, END
BEGIN NOW And 't is t' appear a foe, t' appear a Greek; END
BEGIN NOW Already you my name and country know; END
BEGIN NOW Assuage your thirst of blood, and strike the blow: END
BEGIN NOW My death will both the kingly brothers please, END
BEGIN NOW And set insatiate Ithacus at ease.' END
BEGIN NOW This fair unfinish'd tale, these broken starts, END
BEGIN NOW Rais'd expectations in our longing hearts: END
BEGIN NOW Unknowing as we were in Grecian arts. END
BEGIN NOW His former trembling once again renew'd, END
BEGIN NOW With acted fear, the villain thus pursued: END
BEGIN NOW 'Long had the Grecians (tir'd with fruitless care, END
BEGIN NOW And wearied with an unsuccessful war) END
BEGIN NOW Resolv'd to raise the siege, and leave the town; END
BEGIN NOW And, had the gods permitted, they had gone; END
BEGIN NOW But oft the wintry seas and southern winds END
BEGIN NOW Withstood their passage home, and chang'd their minds. END
BEGIN NOW Portents and prodigies their souls amaz'd; END
BEGIN NOW But most, when this stupendous pile was rais'd: END
BEGIN NOW Then flaming meteors, hung in air, were seen, END
BEGIN NOW And thunders rattled thro' a sky serene. END
BEGIN NOW Dismay'd, and fearful of some dire event, END
BEGIN NOW Eurypylus t' enquire their fate was sent. END
BEGIN NOW He from the gods this dreadful answer brought: END
BEGIN NOW O Grecians, when the Trojan shores you sought, END
BEGIN NOW Your passage with a virgin's blood was bought: END
BEGIN NOW So must your safe return be bought again, END
BEGIN NOW And Grecian blood once more atone the main. END
BEGIN NOW The spreading rumor round the people ran; END
BEGIN NOW All fear'd, and each believ'd himself the man. END
BEGIN NOW Ulysses took th' advantage of their fright; END
BEGIN NOW Call'd Calchas, and produc'd in open sight: END
BEGIN NOW Then bade him name the wretch, ordain'd by fate END
BEGIN NOW The public victim, to redeem the state. END
BEGIN NOW Already some presag'd the dire event, END
BEGIN NOW And saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant. END
BEGIN NOW For twice five days the good old seer withstood END
BEGIN NOW Till, tir'd, with endless clamors and pursuit END
BEGIN NOW Of Ithacus, he stood no longer mute; END
BEGIN NOW But, as it was agreed, pronounc'd that I END
BEGIN NOW Was destin'd by the wrathful gods to die. END
BEGIN NOW All prais'd the sentence, pleas'd the storm should fall END
BEGIN NOW On one alone, whose fury threaten'd all. END
BEGIN NOW The dismal day was come; the priests prepare END
BEGIN NOW Their leaven'd cakes, and fillets for my hair. END
BEGIN NOW I follow'd nature's laws, and must avow END
BEGIN NOW I broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow. END
BEGIN NOW Hid in a weedy lake all night I lay, END
BEGIN NOW Secure of safety when they sail'd away. END
BEGIN NOW But now what further hopes for me remain, END
BEGIN NOW To see my friends, or native soil, again; END
BEGIN NOW My tender infants, or my careful sire, END
BEGIN NOW Whom they returning will to death require; END
BEGIN NOW Will perpetrate on them their first design, END
BEGIN NOW And take the forfeit of their heads for mine? END
BEGIN NOW Which, O! if pity mortal minds can move, END
BEGIN NOW If there be faith below, or gods above, END
BEGIN NOW If innocence and truth can claim desert, END
BEGIN NOW Ye Trojans, from an injur'd wretch avert.' END
BEGIN NOW False tears true pity move; the king commands END
BEGIN NOW To loose his fetters, and unbind his hands: END
BEGIN NOW Then adds these friendly words: 'Dismiss thy fears; END
BEGIN NOW Forget the Greeks; be mine as thou wert theirs. END
BEGIN NOW But truly tell, was it for force or guile, END
BEGIN NOW Or some religious end, you rais'd the pile?' END
BEGIN NOW Thus said the king. He, full of fraudful arts, END
BEGIN NOW This well-invented tale for truth imparts: END
BEGIN NOW 'Ye lamps of heav'n!' he said, and lifted high END
BEGIN NOW His hands now free, 'thou venerable sky! END
BEGIN NOW Inviolable pow'rs, ador'd with dread! END
BEGIN NOW Ye fatal fillets, that once bound this head! END
BEGIN NOW Ye sacred altars, from whose flames I fled! END
BEGIN NOW Be all of you adjur'd; and grant I may, END
BEGIN NOW Without a crime, th' ungrateful Greeks betray, END
BEGIN NOW Reveal the secrets of the guilty state, END
BEGIN NOW And justly punish whom I justly hate! END
BEGIN NOW But you, O king, preserve the faith you gave, END
BEGIN NOW If I, to save myself, your empire save. END
BEGIN NOW The Grecian hopes, and all th' attempts they made, END
BEGIN NOW Were only founded on Minerva's aid. END
BEGIN NOW But from the time when impious Diomede, END
BEGIN NOW And false Ulysses, that inventive head, END
BEGIN NOW Her fatal image from the temple drew, END
BEGIN NOW The sleeping guardians of the castle slew, END
BEGIN NOW Her virgin statue with their bloody hands END
BEGIN NOW Polluted, and profan'd her holy bands; END
BEGIN NOW From thence the tide of fortune left their shore, END
BEGIN NOW And ebb'd much faster than it flow'd before: END
BEGIN NOW Their courage languish'd, as their hopes decay'd; END
BEGIN NOW And Pallas, now averse, refus'd her aid. END
BEGIN NOW Nor did the goddess doubtfully declare END
BEGIN NOW Her alter'd mind and alienated care. END
BEGIN NOW When first her fatal image touch'd the ground, END
BEGIN NOW She sternly cast her glaring eyes around, END
BEGIN NOW That sparkled as they roll'd, and seem'd to threat: END
BEGIN NOW Her heav'nly limbs distill'd a briny sweat. END
BEGIN NOW Thrice from the ground she leap'd, was seen to wield END
BEGIN NOW Her brandish'd lance, and shake her horrid shield. END
BEGIN NOW Then Calchas bade our host for flight END
BEGIN NOW And hope no conquest from the tedious war, END
BEGIN NOW Till first they sail'd for Greece; with pray'rs besought END
BEGIN NOW Her injur'd pow'r, and better omens brought. END
BEGIN NOW And now their navy plows the wat'ry main, END
BEGIN NOW Yet soon expect it on your shores again, END
BEGIN NOW With Pallas pleas'd; as Calchas did ordain. END
BEGIN NOW But first, to reconcile the blue-ey'd maid END
BEGIN NOW For her stol'n statue and her tow'r betray'd, END
BEGIN NOW Warn'd by the seer, to her offended name END
BEGIN NOW We rais'd and dedicate this wondrous frame, END
BEGIN NOW So lofty, lest thro' your forbidden gates END
BEGIN NOW It pass, and intercept our better fates: END
BEGIN NOW For, once admitted there, our hopes are lost; END
BEGIN NOW And Troy may then a new Palladium boast; END
BEGIN NOW For so religion and the gods ordain, END
BEGIN NOW That, if you violate with hands profane END
BEGIN NOW Minerva's gift, your town in flames shall burn, END
BEGIN NOW (Which omen, O ye gods, on Graecia turn!) END
BEGIN NOW But if it climb, with your assisting hands, END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan walls, and in the city stands; END
BEGIN NOW Then Troy shall Argos and Mycenae burn, END
BEGIN NOW And the reverse of fate on us return.' END
BEGIN NOW With such deceits he gain'd their easy hearts, END
BEGIN NOW Too prone to credit his perfidious arts. END
BEGIN NOW What Diomede, nor Thetis' greater son, END
BEGIN NOW A thousand ships, nor ten years' siege, had done- END
BEGIN NOW False tears and fawning words the city won. END
BEGIN NOW A greater omen, and of worse portent, END
BEGIN NOW Did our unwary minds with fear torment, END
BEGIN NOW Concurring to produce the dire event. END
BEGIN NOW Laocoon, Neptune's priest by lot that year, END
BEGIN NOW With solemn pomp then sacrific'd a steer; END
BEGIN NOW When, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied END
BEGIN NOW Two serpents, rank'd abreast, the seas divide, END
BEGIN NOW And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide. END
BEGIN NOW Their flaming crests above the waves they show; END
BEGIN NOW Their bellies seem to burn the seas below; END
BEGIN NOW Their speckled tails advance to steer their course, END
BEGIN NOW And on the sounding shore the flying billows force. END
BEGIN NOW And now the strand, and now the plain they held; END
BEGIN NOW Their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were fill'd; END
BEGIN NOW Their nimble tongues they brandish'd as they came, END
BEGIN NOW And lick'd their hissing jaws, that sputter'd flame. END
BEGIN NOW We fled amaz'd; their destin'd way they take, END
BEGIN NOW And to Laocoon and his children make; END
BEGIN NOW And first around the tender boys they wind, END
BEGIN NOW Then with their sharpen'd fangs their limbs and bodies grind. END
BEGIN NOW The wretched father, running to their aid END
BEGIN NOW With pious haste, but vain, they next invade; END
BEGIN NOW Twice round his waist their winding volumes roll'd; END
BEGIN NOW And twice about his gasping throat they fold. END
BEGIN NOW The priest thus doubly chok'd, their crests divide, END
BEGIN NOW And tow'ring o'er his head in triumph ride. END
BEGIN NOW With both his hands he labors at the knots; END
BEGIN NOW His holy fillets the blue venom blots; END
BEGIN NOW His roaring fills the flitting air around. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, when an ox receives a glancing wound, END
BEGIN NOW He breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies, END
BEGIN NOW And with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies. END
BEGIN NOW Their tasks perform'd, the serpents quit their prey, END
BEGIN NOW And to the tow'r of Pallas make their way: END
BEGIN NOW Couch'd at her feet, they lie protected there END
BEGIN NOW By her large buckler and protended spear. END
BEGIN NOW Amazement seizes all; the gen'ral cry END
BEGIN NOW Proclaims Laocoon justly doom'd to die, END
BEGIN NOW Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood, END
BEGIN NOW And dared to violate the sacred wood. END
BEGIN NOW All vote t' admit the steed, that vows be paid END
BEGIN NOW And incense offer'd to th' offended maid. END
BEGIN NOW A spacious breach is made; the town lies bare; END
BEGIN NOW Some hoisting-levers, some the wheels prepare END
BEGIN NOW And fasten to the horse's feet; the rest END
BEGIN NOW With cables haul along th' unwieldly beast. END
BEGIN NOW Each on his fellow for assistance calls; END
BEGIN NOW At length the fatal fabric mounts the walls, END
BEGIN NOW Big with destruction. Boys with chaplets crown'd, END
BEGIN NOW And choirs of virgins, sing and dance around. END
BEGIN NOW Thus rais'd aloft, and then descending down, END
BEGIN NOW It enters o'er our heads, and threats the town. END
BEGIN NOW O sacred city, built by hands divine! END
BEGIN NOW O valiant heroes of the Trojan line! END
BEGIN NOW Four times he struck: as oft the clashing sound END
BEGIN NOW Of arms was heard, and inward groans rebound. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, mad with zeal, and blinded with our fate, END
BEGIN NOW We haul along the horse in solemn state; END
BEGIN NOW Then place the dire portent within the tow'r. END
BEGIN NOW Cassandra cried, and curs'd th' unhappy hour; END
BEGIN NOW Foretold our fate; but, by the god's decree, END
BEGIN NOW All heard, and none believ'd the prophecy. END
BEGIN NOW With branches we the fanes adorn, and waste, END
BEGIN NOW In jollity, the day ordain'd to be the last. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime the rapid heav'ns roll'd down the light, END
BEGIN NOW And on the shaded ocean rush'd the night; END
BEGIN NOW Our men, secure, nor guards nor sentries held, END
BEGIN NOW But easy sleep their weary limbs compell'd. END
BEGIN NOW The Grecians had embark'd their naval pow'rs END
BEGIN NOW From Tenedos, and sought our well-known shores, END
BEGIN NOW Safe under covert of the silent night, END
BEGIN NOW And guided by th' imperial galley's light; END
BEGIN NOW When Sinon, favor'd by the partial gods, END
BEGIN NOW Unlock'd the horse, and op'd his dark abodes; END
BEGIN NOW Restor'd to vital air our hidden foes, END
BEGIN NOW Who joyful from their long confinement rose. END
BEGIN NOW Tysander bold, and Sthenelus their guide, END
BEGIN NOW And dire Ulysses down the cable slide: END
BEGIN NOW Then Thoas, Athamas, and Pyrrhus haste; END
BEGIN NOW Nor was the Podalirian hero last, END
BEGIN NOW Nor injur'd Menelaus, nor the fam'd END
BEGIN NOW Epeus, who the fatal engine fram'd. END
BEGIN NOW A nameless crowd succeed; their forces join END
BEGIN NOW T' invade the town, oppress'd with sleep and wine. END
BEGIN NOW Those few they find awake first meet their fate; END
BEGIN NOW Then to their fellows they unbar the gate. END
BEGIN NOW 'T was in the dead of night, when sleep repairs END
BEGIN NOW Our bodies worn with toils, our minds with cares, END
BEGIN NOW When Hector's ghost before my sight appears: END
BEGIN NOW A bloody shroud he seem'd, and bath'd in tears; END
BEGIN NOW Such as he was, when, by Pelides slain, END
BEGIN NOW Thessalian coursers dragg'd him o'er the plain. END
BEGIN NOW Swoln were his feet, as when the thongs were thrust END
BEGIN NOW Thro' the bor'd holes; his body black with dust; END
BEGIN NOW Unlike that Hector who return'd from toils END
BEGIN NOW Of war, triumphant, in Aeacian spoils, END
BEGIN NOW Or him who made the fainting Greeks retire, END
BEGIN NOW And launch'd against their navy Phrygian fire. END
BEGIN NOW His hair and beard stood stiffen'd with his gore; END
BEGIN NOW And all the wounds he for his country bore END
BEGIN NOW Now stream'd afresh, and with new purple ran. END
BEGIN NOW I wept to see the visionary man, END
BEGIN NOW And, while my trance continued, thus began: END
BEGIN NOW 'O light of Trojans, and support of Troy, END
BEGIN NOW Thy father's champion, and thy country's joy! END
BEGIN NOW O, long expected by thy friends! from whence END
BEGIN NOW Art thou so late return'd for our defense? END
BEGIN NOW Do we behold thee, wearied as we are END
BEGIN NOW With length of labors, and with toils of war? END
BEGIN NOW After so many fun'rals of thy own END
BEGIN NOW Art thou restor'd to thy declining town? END
BEGIN NOW But say, what wounds are these? What new disgrace END
BEGIN NOW Deforms the manly features of thy face?' END
BEGIN NOW To this the specter no reply did frame, END
BEGIN NOW But answer'd to the cause for which he came, END
BEGIN NOW And, groaning from the bottom of his breast, END
BEGIN NOW This warning in these mournful words express'd: END
BEGIN NOW 'O goddess-born! escape, by timely flight, END
BEGIN NOW The flames and horrors of this fatal night. END
BEGIN NOW The foes already have possess'd the wall; END
BEGIN NOW Troy nods from high, and totters to her fall. END
BEGIN NOW Enough is paid to Priam's royal name, END
BEGIN NOW More than enough to duty and to fame. END
BEGIN NOW If by a mortal hand my father's throne END
BEGIN NOW Could be defended, 't was by mine alone. END
BEGIN NOW Now Troy to thee commends her future state, END
BEGIN NOW And gives her gods companions of thy fate: END
BEGIN NOW From their assistance walls expect, END
BEGIN NOW Which, wand'ring long, at last thou shalt erect.' END
BEGIN NOW He said, and brought me, from their blest abodes, END
BEGIN NOW The venerable statues of the gods, END
BEGIN NOW With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir, END
BEGIN NOW The wreaths and relics of th' immortal fire. END
BEGIN NOW Now peals of shouts come thund'ring from afar, END
BEGIN NOW Cries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled war: END
BEGIN NOW The noise approaches, tho' our palace stood END
BEGIN NOW Aloof from streets, encompass'd with a wood. END
BEGIN NOW Louder, and yet more loud, I hear th' alarms END
BEGIN NOW Of human cries distinct, and clashing arms. END
BEGIN NOW Fear broke my slumbers; I no longer stay, END
BEGIN NOW But mount the terrace, thence the town survey, END
BEGIN NOW And hearken what the frightful sounds convey. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, when a flood of fire by wind is borne, END
BEGIN NOW Crackling it rolls, and mows the standing corn; END
BEGIN NOW Or deluges, descending on the plains, END
BEGIN NOW Sweep o'er the yellow year, destroy the pains END
BEGIN NOW Of lab'ring oxen and the peasant's gains; END
BEGIN NOW Unroot the forest oaks, and bear away END
BEGIN NOW Flocks, folds, and trees, and undistinguish'd prey: END
BEGIN NOW The shepherd climbs the cliff, and sees from far END
BEGIN NOW The wasteful ravage of the wat'ry war. END
BEGIN NOW Then Hector's faith was manifestly clear'd, END
BEGIN NOW And Grecian frauds in open light appear'd. END
BEGIN NOW The palace of Deiphobus ascends END
BEGIN NOW In smoky flames, and catches on his friends. END
BEGIN NOW Ucalegon burns next: the seas are bright END
BEGIN NOW With splendor not their own, and shine with Trojan light. END
BEGIN NOW New clamors and new clangors now arise, END
BEGIN NOW The sound of trumpets mix'd with fighting cries. END
BEGIN NOW With frenzy seiz'd, I run to meet th' alarms, END
BEGIN NOW Resolv'd on death, resolv'd to die in arms, END
BEGIN NOW But first to gather friends, with them t' oppose END
BEGIN NOW (If fortune favor'd) and repel the foes; END
BEGIN NOW Spurr'd by my courage, by my country fir'd, END
BEGIN NOW With sense of honor and revenge inspir'd. END
BEGIN NOW Pantheus, Apollo's priest, a sacred name, END
BEGIN NOW Had scap'd the Grecian swords, and pass'd the flame: END
BEGIN NOW With relics loaden. to my doors he fled, END
BEGIN NOW And by the hand his tender grandson led. END
BEGIN NOW 'What hope, O Pantheus? whither can we run? END
BEGIN NOW Where make a stand? and what may yet be done?' END
BEGIN NOW Scarce had I said, when Pantheus, with a groan: END
BEGIN NOW 'Troy is no more, and Ilium was a town! END
BEGIN NOW The fatal day, th' appointed hour, is come, END
BEGIN NOW When wrathful Jove's irrevocable doom END
BEGIN NOW Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands. END
BEGIN NOW The fire consumes the town, the foe commands; END
BEGIN NOW And armed hosts, an unexpected force, END
BEGIN NOW Break from the bowels of the fatal horse. END
BEGIN NOW Within the gates, proud Sinon throws about END
BEGIN NOW The flames; and foes for entrance press without, END
BEGIN NOW With thousand others, whom I fear to name, END
BEGIN NOW More than from Argos or Mycenae came. END
BEGIN NOW To sev'ral posts their parties they divide; END
BEGIN NOW Some block the narrow streets, some scour the wide: END
BEGIN NOW The bold they kill, th' unwary they surprise; END
BEGIN NOW Who fights finds death, and death finds him who flies. END
BEGIN NOW The warders of the gate but scarce maintain END
BEGIN NOW Th' unequal combat, and resist in vain.' END
BEGIN NOW I heard; and Heav'n, that well-born souls inspires, END
BEGIN NOW Prompts me thro' lifted swords and rising fires END
BEGIN NOW To run where clashing arms and clamor calls, END
BEGIN NOW And rush undaunted to defend the walls. END
BEGIN NOW Ripheus and Iph'itus by my side engage, END
BEGIN NOW For valor one renown'd, and one for age. END
BEGIN NOW Dymas and Hypanis by moonlight knew END
BEGIN NOW My motions and my mien, and to my party drew; END
BEGIN NOW With young Coroebus, who by love was led END
BEGIN NOW To win renown and fair Cassandra's bed, END
BEGIN NOW And lately brought his troops to Priam's aid, END
BEGIN NOW Forewarn'd in vain by the prophetic maid. END
BEGIN NOW Whom when I saw resolv'd in arms to fall, END
BEGIN NOW And that one spirit animated all: END
BEGIN NOW 'Brave souls!' said I,- 'but brave, alas! in vain- END
BEGIN NOW Come, finish what our cruel fates ordain. END
BEGIN NOW You see the desp'rate state of our affairs, END
BEGIN NOW And heav'n's protecting pow'rs are deaf to pray'rs. END
BEGIN NOW The passive gods behold the Greeks defile END
BEGIN NOW Their temples, and abandon to the spoil END
BEGIN NOW Their own abodes: we, feeble few, conspire END
BEGIN NOW To save a sinking town, involv'd in fire. END
BEGIN NOW Then let us fall, but fall amidst our foes: END
BEGIN NOW Despair of life the means of living shows.' END
BEGIN NOW So bold a speech incourag'd their desire END
BEGIN NOW Of death, and added fuel to their fire. END
BEGIN NOW As hungry wolves, with raging appetite, END
BEGIN NOW Scour thro' the fields, nor fear the stormy night- END
BEGIN NOW Their whelps at home expect the promis'd food, END
BEGIN NOW And long to temper their dry chaps in blood- END
BEGIN NOW So rush'd we forth at once; resolv'd to die, END
BEGIN NOW Resolv'd, in death, the last extremes to try. END
BEGIN NOW We leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare END
BEGIN NOW Th' unequal combat in the public square: END
BEGIN NOW Night was our friend; our leader was despair. END
BEGIN NOW What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night? END
BEGIN NOW What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright? END
BEGIN NOW An ancient and imperial city falls: END
BEGIN NOW The streets are fill'd with frequent funerals; END
BEGIN NOW Houses and holy temples float in blood, END
BEGIN NOW And hostile nations make a common flood. END
BEGIN NOW Not only Trojans fall; but, in their turn, END
BEGIN NOW The vanquish'd triumph, and the victors mourn. END
BEGIN NOW Ours take new courage from despair and night: END
BEGIN NOW Confus'd the fortune is, confus'd the fight. END
BEGIN NOW All parts resound with tumults, plaints, and fears; END
BEGIN NOW And grisly Death in sundry shapes appears. END
BEGIN NOW Androgeos fell among us, with his band, END
BEGIN NOW Who thought us Grecians newly come to land. END
BEGIN NOW 'From whence,' said he, 'my friends, this long delay? END
BEGIN NOW You loiter, while the spoils are borne away: END
BEGIN NOW Our ships are laden with the Trojan store; END
BEGIN NOW And you, like truants, come too late ashore.' END
BEGIN NOW He said, but soon corrected his mistake, END
BEGIN NOW Found, by the doubtful answers which we make: END
BEGIN NOW Amaz'd, he would have shunn'd th' unequal fight; END
BEGIN NOW But we, more num'rous, intercept his flight. END
BEGIN NOW As when some peasant, in a bushy brake, END
BEGIN NOW Has with unwary footing press'd a snake; END
BEGIN NOW He starts aside, astonish'd, when he spies END
BEGIN NOW His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes; END
BEGIN NOW So from our arms surpris'd Androgeos flies. END
BEGIN NOW In vain; for him and his we compass'd round, END
BEGIN NOW Possess'd with fear, unknowing of the ground, END
BEGIN NOW And of their lives an easy conquest found. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Fortune on our first endeavor smil'd. END
BEGIN NOW Coroebus then, with youthful hopes beguil'd, END
BEGIN NOW Swoln with success, and a daring mind, END
BEGIN NOW This new invention fatally design'd. END
BEGIN NOW 'My friends,' said he, 'since Fortune shows the way, END
BEGIN NOW 'T is fit we should th' auspicious guide obey. END
BEGIN NOW For what has she these Grecian arms bestow'd, END
BEGIN NOW But their destruction, and the Trojans' good? END
BEGIN NOW Then change we shields, and their devices bear: END
BEGIN NOW Let fraud supply the want of force in war. END
BEGIN NOW They find us arms.' This said, himself he dress'd END
BEGIN NOW In dead Androgeos' spoils, his upper vest, END
BEGIN NOW His painted buckler, and his plumy crest. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan train, END
BEGIN NOW Lay down their own attire, and strip the slain. END
BEGIN NOW Mix'd with the Greeks, we go with ill presage, END
BEGIN NOW Flatter'd with hopes to glut our greedy rage; END
BEGIN NOW Unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet, END
BEGIN NOW And strew with Grecian carcasses the street. END
BEGIN NOW Thus while their straggling parties we defeat, END
BEGIN NOW Some to the shore and safer ships retreat; END
BEGIN NOW And some, oppress'd with more ignoble fear, END
BEGIN NOW Remount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there. END
BEGIN NOW But, ah! what use of valor can be made, END
BEGIN NOW When heav'n's propitious pow'rs refuse their aid! END
BEGIN NOW Behold the royal prophetess, the fair END
BEGIN NOW Cassandra, dragg'd by her dishevel'd hair, END
BEGIN NOW Whom not Minerva's shrine, nor sacred bands, END
BEGIN NOW In safety could protect from sacrilegious hands: END
BEGIN NOW On heav'n she cast her eyes, she sigh'd, she cried- END
BEGIN NOW 'T was all she could- her tender arms were tied. END
BEGIN NOW So sad a sight Coroebus could not bear; END
BEGIN NOW But, fir'd with rage, distracted with despair, END
BEGIN NOW Amid the barb'rous ravishers he flew: END
BEGIN NOW Our leader's rash example we pursue. END
BEGIN NOW But storms of stones, from the proud temple's height, END
BEGIN NOW Pour down, and on our batter'd helms alight: END
BEGIN NOW We from our friends receiv'd this fatal blow, END
BEGIN NOW Who thought us Grecians, as we seem'd in show. END
BEGIN NOW They aim at the mistaken crests, from high; END
BEGIN NOW And ours beneath the pond'rous ruin lie. END
BEGIN NOW Then, mov'd with anger and disdain, to see END
BEGIN NOW Their troops dispers'd, the royal virgin free, END
BEGIN NOW The Grecians rally, and their pow'rs unite, END
BEGIN NOW With fury charge us, and renew the fight. END
BEGIN NOW The brother kings with Ajax join their force, END
BEGIN NOW And the whole squadron of Thessalian horse. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, when the rival winds their quarrel try, END
BEGIN NOW Contending for the kingdom of the sky, END
BEGIN NOW South, east, and west, on airy coursers borne; END
BEGIN NOW The whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn: END
BEGIN NOW Then Nereus strikes the deep; the billows rise, END
BEGIN NOW And, mix'd with ooze and sand, pollute the skies. END
BEGIN NOW The troops we squander'd first again appear END
BEGIN NOW From several quarters, and enclose the rear. END
BEGIN NOW They first observe, and to the rest betray, END
BEGIN NOW Our diff'rent speech; our borrow'd arms survey. END
BEGIN NOW Oppress'd with odds, we fall; Coroebus first, END
BEGIN NOW At Pallas' altar, by Peneleus pierc'd. END
BEGIN NOW Then Ripheus follow'd, in th' unequal fight; END
BEGIN NOW Just of his word, observant of the right: END
BEGIN NOW Heav'n thought not so. Dymas their fate attends, END
BEGIN NOW With Hypanis, mistaken by their friends. END
BEGIN NOW Nor, Pantheus, thee, thy miter, nor the bands END
BEGIN NOW Of awful Phoebus, sav'd from impious hands. END
BEGIN NOW Ye Trojan flames, your testimony bear, END
BEGIN NOW What I perform'd, and what I suffer'd there; END
BEGIN NOW No sword avoiding in the fatal strife, END
BEGIN NOW Expos'd to death, and prodigal of life; END
BEGIN NOW Witness, ye heavens! I live not by my fault: END
BEGIN NOW I strove to have deserv'd the death I sought. END
BEGIN NOW But, when I could not fight, and would have died, END
BEGIN NOW Borne off to distance by the growing tide, END
BEGIN NOW Old Iphitus and I were hurried thence, END
BEGIN NOW With Pelias wounded, and without defense. END
BEGIN NOW New clamors from th' invested palace ring: END
BEGIN NOW We run to die, or disengage the king. END
BEGIN NOW So hot th' assault, so high the tumult rose, END
BEGIN NOW While ours defend, and while the Greeks oppose END
BEGIN NOW As all the Dardan and Argolic race END
BEGIN NOW Had been contracted in that narrow space; END
BEGIN NOW Or as all Ilium else were void of fear, END
BEGIN NOW And tumult, war, and slaughter, only there. END
BEGIN NOW Their targets in a tortoise cast, the foes, END
BEGIN NOW Secure advancing, to the turrets rose: END
BEGIN NOW Some mount the scaling ladders; some, more bold, END
BEGIN NOW Swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold; END
BEGIN NOW Their left hand gripes their bucklers in th' ascent, END
BEGIN NOW While with their right they seize the battlement. END
BEGIN NOW From their demolish'd tow'rs the Trojans throw END
BEGIN NOW Huge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe; END
BEGIN NOW And heavy beams and rafters from the sides END
BEGIN NOW (Such arms their last necessity provides) END
BEGIN NOW And gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high, END
BEGIN NOW The marks of state and ancient royalty. END
BEGIN NOW The guards below, fix'd in the pass, attend END
BEGIN NOW The charge undaunted, and the gate defend. END
BEGIN NOW Renew'd in courage with recover'd breath, END
BEGIN NOW A second time we ran to tempt our death, END
BEGIN NOW To clear the palace from the foe, succeed END
BEGIN NOW The weary living, and revenge the dead. END
BEGIN NOW A postern door, yet unobserv'd and free, END
BEGIN NOW Join'd by the length of a blind gallery, END
BEGIN NOW To the king's closet led: a way well known END
BEGIN NOW To Hector's wife, while Priam held the throne, END
BEGIN NOW Thro' which she brought Astyanax, unseen, END
BEGIN NOW To cheer his grandsire and his grandsire's queen. END
BEGIN NOW Thro' this we pass, and mount the tow'r, from whence END
BEGIN NOW With unavailing arms the Trojans make defense. END
BEGIN NOW From this the trembling king had oft descried END
BEGIN NOW The Grecian camp, and saw their navy ride. END
BEGIN NOW Beams from its lofty height with swords we hew, END
BEGIN NOW Then, wrenching with our hands, th' assault renew; END
BEGIN NOW And, where the rafters on the columns meet, END
BEGIN NOW We push them headlong with our arms and feet. END
BEGIN NOW The lightning flies not swifter than the fall, END
BEGIN NOW Nor thunder louder than the ruin'd wall: END
BEGIN NOW Down goes the top at once; the Greeks beneath END
BEGIN NOW Are piecemeal torn, or pounded into death. END
BEGIN NOW Yet more succeed, and more to death are sent; END
BEGIN NOW We cease not from above, nor they below relent. END
BEGIN NOW Before the gate stood Pyrrhus, threat'ning loud, END
BEGIN NOW With glitt'ring arms conspicuous in the crowd. END
BEGIN NOW So shines, renew'd in youth, the crested snake, END
BEGIN NOW Who slept the winter in a thorny brake, END
BEGIN NOW And, casting off his slough when spring returns, END
BEGIN NOW Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns; END
BEGIN NOW Restor'd with poisonous herbs, his ardent sides END
BEGIN NOW Reflect the sun; and rais'd on spires he rides; END
BEGIN NOW High o'er the grass, hissing he rolls along, END
BEGIN NOW And brandishes by fits his forky tongue. END
BEGIN NOW Proud Periphas, and fierce Automedon, END
BEGIN NOW His father's charioteer, together run END
BEGIN NOW To force the gate; the Scyrian infantry END
BEGIN NOW Rush on in crowds, and the barr'd passage free. END
BEGIN NOW Ent'ring the court, with shouts the skies they rend; END
BEGIN NOW And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend. END
BEGIN NOW Himself, among the foremost, deals his blows, END
BEGIN NOW And with his ax repeated strokes bestows END
BEGIN NOW On the strong doors; then all their shoulders ply, END
BEGIN NOW Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly. END
BEGIN NOW He hews apace; the double bars at length END
BEGIN NOW Yield to his ax and unresisted strength. END
BEGIN NOW A mighty breach is made: the rooms conceal'd END
BEGIN NOW Appear, and all the palace is reveal'd; END
BEGIN NOW The halls of audience, and of public state, END
BEGIN NOW And where the lonely queen in secret sate. END
BEGIN NOW Arm'd soldiers now by trembling maids are seen, END
BEGIN NOW With not a door, and scarce a space, between. END
BEGIN NOW The house is fill'd with loud laments and cries, END
BEGIN NOW And shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies; END
BEGIN NOW The fearful matrons run from place to place, END
BEGIN NOW And kiss the thresholds, and the posts embrace. END
BEGIN NOW The fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies, END
BEGIN NOW And all his father sparkles in his eyes; END
BEGIN NOW Nor bars, nor fighting guards, his force sustain: END
BEGIN NOW The bars are broken, and the guards are slain. END
BEGIN NOW In rush the Greeks, and all the apartments fill; END
BEGIN NOW Those few defendants whom they find, they kill. END
BEGIN NOW Not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood END
BEGIN NOW Roars, when he finds his rapid course withstood; END
BEGIN NOW Bears down the dams with unresisted sway, END
BEGIN NOW And sweeps the cattle and the cots away. END
BEGIN NOW These eyes beheld him when he march'd between END
BEGIN NOW The brother kings: I saw th' unhappy queen, END
BEGIN NOW The hundred wives, and where old Priam stood, END
BEGIN NOW To stain his hallow'd altar with his brood. END
BEGIN NOW The fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he, END
BEGIN NOW So large a promise, of a progeny), END
BEGIN NOW The posts, of plated gold, and hung with spoils, END
BEGIN NOW Fell the reward of the proud victor's toils. END
BEGIN NOW Where'er the raging fire had left a space, END
BEGIN NOW The Grecians enter and possess the place. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps you may of Priam's fate enquire. END
BEGIN NOW He, when he saw his regal town on fire, END
BEGIN NOW His ruin'd palace, and his ent'ring foes, END
BEGIN NOW On ev'ry side inevitable woes, END
BEGIN NOW In arms, disus'd, invests his limbs, decay'd, END
BEGIN NOW Like them, with age; a late and useless aid. END
BEGIN NOW His feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain; END
BEGIN NOW Loaded, not arm'd, he creeps along with pain, END
BEGIN NOW Despairing of success, ambitious to be slain! END
BEGIN NOW Uncover'd but by heav'n, there stood in view END
BEGIN NOW An altar; near the hearth a laurel grew, END
BEGIN NOW Dodder'd with age, whose boughs encompass round END
BEGIN NOW The household gods, and shade the holy ground. END
BEGIN NOW Here Hecuba, with all her helpless train END
BEGIN NOW Of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain. END
BEGIN NOW Driv'n like a flock of doves along the sky, END
BEGIN NOW Their images they hug, and to their altars fly. END
BEGIN NOW The Queen, when she beheld her trembling lord, END
BEGIN NOW And hanging by his side a heavy sword, END
BEGIN NOW 'What rage,' she cried, 'has seiz'd my husband's mind? END
BEGIN NOW What arms are these, and to what use design'd? END
BEGIN NOW These times want other aids! Were Hector here, END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n Hector now in vain, like Priam, would appear. END
BEGIN NOW With us, one common shelter thou shalt find, END
BEGIN NOW Or in one common fate with us be join'd.' END
BEGIN NOW She said, and with a last salute embrac'd END
BEGIN NOW The poor old man, and by the laurel plac'd. END
BEGIN NOW Behold! Polites, one of Priam's sons, END
BEGIN NOW Pursued by Pyrrhus, there for safety runs. END
BEGIN NOW Thro' swords and foes, amaz'd and hurt, he flies END
BEGIN NOW Thro' empty courts and open galleries. END
BEGIN NOW Him Pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues, END
BEGIN NOW And often reaches, and his thrusts renews. END
BEGIN NOW The youth, transfix'd, with lamentable cries, END
BEGIN NOW Expires before his wretched parent's eyes: END
BEGIN NOW Whom gasping at his feet when Priam saw, END
BEGIN NOW The fear of death gave place to nature's law; END
BEGIN NOW And, shaking more with anger than with age, END
BEGIN NOW 'The gods,' said he, 'requite thy brutal rage! END
BEGIN NOW As sure they will, barbarian, sure they must, END
BEGIN NOW If there be gods in heav'n, and gods be just- END
BEGIN NOW Who tak'st in wrongs an insolent delight; END
BEGIN NOW With a son's death t' infect a father's sight. END
BEGIN NOW Not he, whom thou and lying fame conspire END
BEGIN NOW To call thee his- not he, thy vaunted sire, END
BEGIN NOW Thus us'd my wretched age: the gods he fear'd, END
BEGIN NOW The laws of nature and of nations heard. END
BEGIN NOW He cheer'd my sorrows, and, for sums of gold, END
BEGIN NOW The bloodless carcass of my Hector sold; END
BEGIN NOW Pitied the woes a parent underwent, END
BEGIN NOW And sent me back in safety from his tent.' END
BEGIN NOW This said, his feeble hand a javelin threw, END
BEGIN NOW Which, flutt'ring, seem'd to loiter as it flew: END
BEGIN NOW Just, and but barely, to the mark it held, END
BEGIN NOW And faintly tinkled on the brazen shield. END
BEGIN NOW Then Pyrrhus thus: 'Go thou from me to fate, END
BEGIN NOW And to my father my foul deeds relate. END
BEGIN NOW Now die!' With that he dragg'd the trembling sire, END
BEGIN NOW Slidd'ring thro' clotter'd blood and holy mire, END
BEGIN NOW (The mingled paste his murder'd son had made,) END
BEGIN NOW Haul'd from beneath the violated shade, END
BEGIN NOW And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid. END
BEGIN NOW His right hand held his bloody falchion bare, END
BEGIN NOW His left he twisted in his hoary hair; END
BEGIN NOW Then, with a speeding thrust, his heart he found: END
BEGIN NOW The lukewarm blood came rushing thro' the wound, END
BEGIN NOW And sanguine streams distain'd the sacred ground. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Priam fell, and shar'd one common fate END
BEGIN NOW With Troy in ashes, and his ruin'd state: END
BEGIN NOW He, who the scepter of all Asia sway'd, END
BEGIN NOW Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey'd. END
BEGIN NOW On the bleak shore now lies th' abandon'd king, END
BEGIN NOW A headless carcass, and a nameless thing. END
BEGIN NOW Then, not before, I felt my cruddled blood END
BEGIN NOW Congeal with fear, my hair with horror stood: END
BEGIN NOW My father's image fill'd my pious mind, END
BEGIN NOW Lest equal years might equal fortune find. END
BEGIN NOW Again I thought on my forsaken wife, END
BEGIN NOW And trembled for my son's abandon'd life. END
BEGIN NOW I look'd about, but found myself alone, END
BEGIN NOW Deserted at my need! My friends were gone. END
BEGIN NOW Some spent with toil, some with despair oppress'd, END
BEGIN NOW Leap'd headlong from the heights; the flames consum'd the rest. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, wand'ring in my way, without a guide, END
BEGIN NOW The graceless Helen in the porch I spied END
BEGIN NOW Of Vesta's temple; there she lurk'd alone; END
BEGIN NOW Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown: END
BEGIN NOW But, by the flames that cast their blaze around, END
BEGIN NOW That common bane of Greece and Troy I found. END
BEGIN NOW For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword; END
BEGIN NOW More dreads the vengeance of her injur'd lord; END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n by those gods who refug'd her abhorr'd. END
BEGIN NOW Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard, END
BEGIN NOW Resolv'd to give her guilt the due reward: END
BEGIN NOW 'Shall she triumphant sail before the wind, END
BEGIN NOW And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind? END
BEGIN NOW Shall she her kingdom and her friends review, END
BEGIN NOW In state attended with a captive crew, END
BEGIN NOW While unreveng'd the good old Priam falls, END
BEGIN NOW And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls? END
BEGIN NOW For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood END
BEGIN NOW Were swell'd with bodies, and were drunk with blood? END
BEGIN NOW 'T is true, a soldier can small honor gain, END
BEGIN NOW And boast no conquest, from a woman slain: END
BEGIN NOW Yet shall the fact not pass without applause, END
BEGIN NOW Of vengeance taken in so just a cause; END
BEGIN NOW The punish'd crime shall set my soul at ease, END
BEGIN NOW And murm'ring manes of my friends appease.' END
BEGIN NOW Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light END
BEGIN NOW Spread o'er the place; and, shining heav'nly bright, END
BEGIN NOW My mother stood reveal'd before my sight END
BEGIN NOW Never so radiant did her eyes appear; END
BEGIN NOW Not her own star confess'd a light so clear: END
BEGIN NOW Great in her charms, as when on gods above END
BEGIN NOW She looks, and breathes herself into their love. END
BEGIN NOW She held my hand, the destin'd blow to break; END
BEGIN NOW Then from her rosy lips began to speak: END
BEGIN NOW 'My son, from whence this madness, this neglect END
BEGIN NOW Of my commands, and those whom I protect? END
BEGIN NOW Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind END
BEGIN NOW Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind. END
BEGIN NOW Look if your helpless father yet survive, END
BEGIN NOW Or if Ascanius or Creusa live. END
BEGIN NOW Around your house the greedy Grecians err; END
BEGIN NOW And these had perish'd in the nightly war, END
BEGIN NOW But for my presence and protecting care. END
BEGIN NOW Not Helen's face, nor Paris, was in fault; END
BEGIN NOW But by the gods was this destruction brought. END
BEGIN NOW Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve END
BEGIN NOW The mists and films that mortal eyes involve, END
BEGIN NOW Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see END
BEGIN NOW The shape of each avenging deity. END
BEGIN NOW Enlighten'd thus, my just commands fulfil, END
BEGIN NOW Nor fear obedience to your mother's will. END
BEGIN NOW Where yon disorder'd heap of ruin lies, END
BEGIN NOW Stones rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise- END
BEGIN NOW Amid that smother Neptune holds his place, END
BEGIN NOW Below the wall's foundation drives his mace, END
BEGIN NOW And heaves the building from the solid base. END
BEGIN NOW Look where, in arms, imperial Juno stands END
BEGIN NOW Full in the Scaean gate, with loud commands, END
BEGIN NOW See! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud, END
BEGIN NOW Bestrides the tow'r, refulgent thro' the cloud: END
BEGIN NOW See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies, END
BEGIN NOW And arms against the town the partial deities. END
BEGIN NOW Haste hence, my son; this fruitless labor end: END
BEGIN NOW Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend: END
BEGIN NOW Haste; and a mother's care your passage shall befriend.' END
BEGIN NOW She said, and swiftly vanish'd from my sight, END
BEGIN NOW Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night. END
BEGIN NOW I look'd, I listen'd; dreadful sounds I hear; END
BEGIN NOW And the dire forms of hostile gods appear. END
BEGIN NOW Troy sunk in flames I saw (nor could prevent), END
BEGIN NOW And Ilium from its old foundations rent; END
BEGIN NOW Rent like a mountain ash, which dar'd the winds, END
BEGIN NOW And stood the sturdy strokes of lab'ring hinds. END
BEGIN NOW About the roots the cruel ax resounds; END
BEGIN NOW The stumps are pierc'd with oft-repeated wounds: END
BEGIN NOW The war is felt on high; the nodding crown END
BEGIN NOW Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honors down. END
BEGIN NOW To their united force it yields, tho' late, END
BEGIN NOW And mourns with mortal groans th' approaching fate: END
BEGIN NOW The roots no more their upper load sustain; END
BEGIN NOW But down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro' the plain. END
BEGIN NOW Descending thence, I scape thro' foes and fire: END
BEGIN NOW Before the goddess, foes and flames retire. END
BEGIN NOW Arriv'd at home, he, for whose only sake, END
BEGIN NOW Or most for his, such toils I undertake, END
BEGIN NOW The good Anchises, whom, by timely flight, END
BEGIN NOW I purpos'd to secure on Ida's height, END
BEGIN NOW Refus'd the journey, resolute to die END
BEGIN NOW And add his fun'rals to the fate of Troy, END
BEGIN NOW Rather than exile and old age sustain. END
BEGIN NOW 'Go you, whose blood runs warm in ev'ry vein. END
BEGIN NOW Had Heav'n decreed that I should life enjoy, END
BEGIN NOW Heav'n had decreed to save unhappy Troy. END
BEGIN NOW 'T is, sure, enough, if not too much, for one, END
BEGIN NOW Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown. END
BEGIN NOW Make haste to save the poor remaining crew, END
BEGIN NOW And give this useless corpse a long adieu. END
BEGIN NOW These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath; END
BEGIN NOW At least the pitying foes will aid my death, END
BEGIN NOW To take my spoils, and leave my body bare: END
BEGIN NOW As for my sepulcher, let Heav'n take care. END
BEGIN NOW 'T is long since I, for my celestial wife END
BEGIN NOW Loath'd by the gods, have dragg'd a ling'ring life; END
BEGIN NOW Since ev'ry hour and moment I expire, END
BEGIN NOW Blasted from heav'n by Jove's avenging fire.' END
BEGIN NOW This oft repeated, he stood fix'd to die: END
BEGIN NOW Myself, my wife, my son, my family, END
BEGIN NOW Intreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry- END
BEGIN NOW 'What, will he still persist, on death resolve, END
BEGIN NOW And in his ruin all his house involve!' END
BEGIN NOW He still persists his reasons to maintain; END
BEGIN NOW Our pray'rs, our tears, our loud laments, are vain. END
BEGIN NOW Urg'd by despair, again I go to try END
BEGIN NOW The fate of arms, resolv'd in fight to die: END
BEGIN NOW 'What hope remains, but what my death must give? END
BEGIN NOW Can I, without so dear a father, live? END
BEGIN NOW You term it prudence, what I baseness call: END
BEGIN NOW Could such a word from such a parent fall? END
BEGIN NOW If Fortune please, and so the gods ordain, END
BEGIN NOW That nothing should of ruin'd Troy remain, END
BEGIN NOW And you conspire with Fortune to be slain, END
BEGIN NOW The way to death is wide, th' approaches near: END
BEGIN NOW For soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear, END
BEGIN NOW Reeking with Priam's blood- the wretch who slew END
BEGIN NOW The son (inhuman) in the father's view, END
BEGIN NOW And then the sire himself to the dire altar drew. END
BEGIN NOW O goddess mother, give me back to Fate; END
BEGIN NOW Your gift was undesir'd, and came too late! END
BEGIN NOW Did you, for this, unhappy me convey END
BEGIN NOW Thro' foes and fires, to see my house a prey? END
BEGIN NOW Shall I my father, wife, and son behold, END
BEGIN NOW Welt'ring in blood, each other's arms infold? END
BEGIN NOW Haste! gird my sword, tho' spent and overcome: END
BEGIN NOW 'T is the last summons to receive our doom. END
BEGIN NOW I hear thee, Fate; and I obey thy call! END
BEGIN NOW Not unreveng'd the foe shall see my fall. END
BEGIN NOW Restore me to the yet unfinish'd fight: END
BEGIN NOW My death is wanting to conclude the night.' END
BEGIN NOW Arm'd once again, my glitt'ring sword I wield, END
BEGIN NOW While th' other hand sustains my weighty shield, END
BEGIN NOW And forth I rush to seek th' abandon'd field. END
BEGIN NOW I went; but sad Creusa stopp'd my way, END
BEGIN NOW And cross the threshold in my passage lay, END
BEGIN NOW Embrac'd my knees, and, when I would have gone, END
BEGIN NOW Shew'd me my feeble sire and tender son: END
BEGIN NOW 'If death be your design, at least,' said she, END
BEGIN NOW 'Take us along to share your destiny. END
BEGIN NOW If any farther hopes in arms remain, END
BEGIN NOW This place, these pledges of your love, maintain. END
BEGIN NOW To whom do you expose your father's life, END
BEGIN NOW Your son's, and mine, your now forgotten wife!' END
BEGIN NOW While thus she fills the house with clam'rous cries, END
BEGIN NOW Our hearing is diverted by our eyes: END
BEGIN NOW For, while I held my son, in the short space END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt our kisses and our last embrace; END
BEGIN NOW Strange to relate, from young Iulus' head END
BEGIN NOW A lambent flame arose, which gently spread END
BEGIN NOW Around his brows, and on his temples fed. END
BEGIN NOW Amaz'd, with running water we prepare END
BEGIN NOW To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair; END
BEGIN NOW But old Anchises, vers'd in omens, rear'd END
BEGIN NOW His hands to heav'n, and this request preferr'd: END
BEGIN NOW 'If any vows, almighty Jove, can bend END
BEGIN NOW Thy will; if piety can pray'rs commend, END
BEGIN NOW Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleas'd to send.' END
BEGIN NOW Scarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear END
BEGIN NOW A peal of rattling thunder roll in air: END
BEGIN NOW There shot a streaming lamp along the sky, END
BEGIN NOW Which on the winged lightning seem'd to fly; END
BEGIN NOW From o'er the roof the blaze began to move, END
BEGIN NOW And, trailing, vanish'd in th' Idaean grove. END
BEGIN NOW It swept a path in heav'n, and shone a guide, END
BEGIN NOW Then in a steaming stench of sulphur died. END
BEGIN NOW The good old man with suppliant hands implor'd END
BEGIN NOW The gods' protection, and their star ador'd. END
BEGIN NOW 'Now, now,' said he, 'my son, no more delay! END
BEGIN NOW I yield, I follow where Heav'n shews the way. END
BEGIN NOW Keep, O my country gods, our dwelling place, END
BEGIN NOW And guard this relic of the Trojan race, END
BEGIN NOW This tender child! These omens are your own, END
BEGIN NOW And you can yet restore the ruin'd town. END
BEGIN NOW At least accomplish what your signs foreshow: END
BEGIN NOW I stand resign'd, and am prepar'd to go.' END
BEGIN NOW He said. The crackling flames appear on high. END
BEGIN NOW And driving sparkles dance along the sky. END
BEGIN NOW With Vulcan's rage the rising winds conspire, END
BEGIN NOW And near our palace roll the flood of fire. END
BEGIN NOW 'Haste, my dear father, ('t is no time to wait,) END
BEGIN NOW And load my shoulders with a willing freight. END
BEGIN NOW Whate'er befalls, your life shall be my care; END
BEGIN NOW One death, or one deliv'rance, we will share. END
BEGIN NOW My hand shall lead our little son; and you, END
BEGIN NOW My faithful consort, shall our steps pursue. END
BEGIN NOW Next, you, my servants, heed my strict commands: END
BEGIN NOW Without the walls a ruin'd temple stands, END
BEGIN NOW To Ceres hallow'd once; a cypress nigh END
BEGIN NOW Shoots up her venerable head on high, END
BEGIN NOW By long religion kept; there bend your feet, END
BEGIN NOW And in divided parties let us meet. END
BEGIN NOW Our country gods, the relics, and the bands, END
BEGIN NOW Hold you, my father, in your guiltless hands: END
BEGIN NOW In me 't is impious holy things to bear, END
BEGIN NOW Red as I am with slaughter, new from war, END
BEGIN NOW Till in some living stream I cleanse the guilt END
BEGIN NOW Of dire debate, and blood in battle spilt.' END
BEGIN NOW Thus, ord'ring all that prudence could provide, END
BEGIN NOW I clothe my shoulders with a lion's hide END
BEGIN NOW And yellow spoils; then, on my bending back, END
BEGIN NOW The welcome load of my dear father take; END
BEGIN NOW While on my better hand Ascanius hung, END
BEGIN NOW And with unequal paces tripp'd along. END
BEGIN NOW Creusa kept behind; by choice we stray END
BEGIN NOW Thro' ev'ry dark and ev'ry devious way. END
BEGIN NOW I, who so bold and dauntless, just before, END
BEGIN NOW The Grecian darts and shock of lances bore, END
BEGIN NOW At ev'ry shadow now am seiz'd with fear, END
BEGIN NOW Not for myself, but for the charge I bear; END
BEGIN NOW Till, near the ruin'd gate arriv'd at last, END
BEGIN NOW Secure, and deeming all the danger past, END
BEGIN NOW A frightful noise of trampling feet we hear. END
BEGIN NOW My father, looking thro' the shades, with fear, END
BEGIN NOW Cried out: 'Haste, haste, my son, the foes are nigh; END
BEGIN NOW Their swords and shining armor I descry.' END
BEGIN NOW Some hostile god, for some unknown offense, END
BEGIN NOW Had sure bereft my mind of better sense; END
BEGIN NOW For, while thro' winding ways I took my flight, END
BEGIN NOW And sought the shelter of the gloomy night, END
BEGIN NOW Alas! I lost Creusa: hard to tell END
BEGIN NOW If by her fatal destiny she fell, END
BEGIN NOW Or weary sate, or wander'd with affright; END
BEGIN NOW But she was lost for ever to my sight. END
BEGIN NOW I knew not, or reflected, till I meet END
BEGIN NOW My friends, at Ceres' now deserted seat. END
BEGIN NOW We met: not one was wanting; only she END
BEGIN NOW Deceiv'd her friends, her son, and wretched me. END
BEGIN NOW What mad expressions did my tongue refuse! END
BEGIN NOW Whom did I not, of gods or men, accuse! END
BEGIN NOW This was the fatal blow, that pain'd me more END
BEGIN NOW Than all I felt from ruin'd Troy before. END
BEGIN NOW Stung with my loss, and raving with despair, END
BEGIN NOW Abandoning my now forgotten care, END
BEGIN NOW Of counsel, comfort, and of hope bereft, END
BEGIN NOW My sire, my son, my country gods I left. END
BEGIN NOW In shining armor once again I sheathe END
BEGIN NOW My limbs, not feeling wounds, nor fearing death. END
BEGIN NOW Then headlong to the burning walls I run, END
BEGIN NOW And seek the danger I was forc'd to shun. END
BEGIN NOW I tread my former tracks; thro' night explore END
BEGIN NOW Each passage, ev'ry street I cross'd before. END
BEGIN NOW All things were full of horror and affright, END
BEGIN NOW And dreadful ev'n the silence of the night. END
BEGIN NOW Then to my father's house I make repair, END
BEGIN NOW With some small glimpse of hope to find her there. END
BEGIN NOW Instead of her, the cruel Greeks I met; END
BEGIN NOW The house was fill'd with foes, with flames beset. END
BEGIN NOW Driv'n on the wings of winds, whole sheets of fire, END
BEGIN NOW Thro' air transported, to the roofs aspire. END
BEGIN NOW From thence to Priam's palace I resort, END
BEGIN NOW And search the citadel and desart court. END
BEGIN NOW Then, unobserv'd, I pass by Juno's church: END
BEGIN NOW A guard of Grecians had possess'd the porch; END
BEGIN NOW There Phoenix and Ulysses watch prey, END
BEGIN NOW And thither all the wealth of Troy convey: END
BEGIN NOW The spoils which they from ransack'd houses brought, END
BEGIN NOW And golden bowls from burning altars caught, END
BEGIN NOW The tables of the gods, the purple vests, END
BEGIN NOW The people's treasure, and the pomp of priests. END
BEGIN NOW A rank of wretched youths, with pinion'd hands, END
BEGIN NOW And captive matrons, in long order stands. END
BEGIN NOW Then, with ungovern'd madness, I proclaim, END
BEGIN NOW Thro' all the silent street, Creusa's name: END
BEGIN NOW Creusa still I call; at length she hears, END
BEGIN NOW And sudden thro' the shades of night appears- END
BEGIN NOW Appears, no more Creusa, nor my wife, END
BEGIN NOW But a pale specter, larger than the life. END
BEGIN NOW I stood; like bristles rose my stiffen'd hair. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief END
BEGIN NOW 'Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief. END
BEGIN NOW Desist, my much-lov'd lord,'t indulge your pain; END
BEGIN NOW You bear no more than what the gods ordain. END
BEGIN NOW My fates permit me not from hence to fly; END
BEGIN NOW Nor he, the great controller of the sky. END
BEGIN NOW Long wand'ring ways for you the pow'rs decree; END
BEGIN NOW On land hard labors, and a length of sea. END
BEGIN NOW Then, after many painful years are past, END
BEGIN NOW On Latium's happy shore you shall be cast, END
BEGIN NOW Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds END
BEGIN NOW The flow'ry meadows, and the feeding folds. END
BEGIN NOW There end your toils; and there your fates provide END
BEGIN NOW A quiet kingdom, and a royal bride: END
BEGIN NOW There fortune shall the Trojan line restore, END
BEGIN NOW And you for lost Creusa weep no more. END
BEGIN NOW Fear not that I shall watch, with servile shame, END
BEGIN NOW Th' imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame; END
BEGIN NOW Or, stooping to the victor's lust, disgrace END
BEGIN NOW My goddess mother, or my royal race. END
BEGIN NOW And now, farewell! The parent of the gods END
BEGIN NOW Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes: END
BEGIN NOW I trust our common issue to your care.' END
BEGIN NOW She said, and gliding pass'd unseen in air. END
BEGIN NOW I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue; END
BEGIN NOW And thrice about her neck my arms I flung, END
BEGIN NOW And, thrice deceiv'd, on vain embraces hung. END
BEGIN NOW Light as an empty dream at break of day, END
BEGIN NOW Or as a blast of wind, she rush'd away. END
BEGIN NOW Thus having pass'd the night in fruitless pain, END
BEGIN NOW I to my longing friends return again, END
BEGIN NOW Amaz'd th' augmented number to behold, END
BEGIN NOW Of men and matrons mix'd, of young and old; END
BEGIN NOW A wretched exil'd crew together brought, END
BEGIN NOW With arms appointed, and with treasure fraught, END
BEGIN NOW Resolv'd, and willing, under my command, END
BEGIN NOW To run all hazards both of sea and land. END
BEGIN NOW The Morn began, from Ida, to display END
BEGIN NOW Her rosy cheeks; and Phosphor led the day: END
BEGIN NOW Before the gates the Grecians took their post, END
BEGIN NOW And all pretense of late relief was lost. END
BEGIN NOW I yield to Fate, unwillingly retire, END
BEGIN NOW And, loaded, up the hill convey my sire. END
BEGIN NOW When Heav'n had overturn'd the Trojan state END
BEGIN NOW And Priam's throne, by too severe a fate; END
BEGIN NOW When ruin'd Troy became the Grecians' prey, END
BEGIN NOW And Ilium's lofty tow'rs in ashes lay; END
BEGIN NOW Warn'd by celestial omens, we retreat, END
BEGIN NOW To seek in foreign lands a happier seat. END
BEGIN NOW Near old Antandros, and at Ida's foot, END
BEGIN NOW The timber of the sacred groves we cut, END
BEGIN NOW And build our fleet; uncertain yet to find END
BEGIN NOW What place the gods for our repose assign'd. END
BEGIN NOW Friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring END
BEGIN NOW Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing, END
BEGIN NOW When old Anchises summon'd all to sea: END
BEGIN NOW The crew my father and the Fates obey. END
BEGIN NOW With sighs and tears I leave my native shore, END
BEGIN NOW And empty fields, where Ilium stood before. END
BEGIN NOW My sire, my son, our less and greater gods, END
BEGIN NOW All sail at once, and cleave the briny floods. END
BEGIN NOW Against our coast appears a spacious land, END
BEGIN NOW Which once the fierce Lycurgus did command, END
BEGIN NOW (Thracia the name- the people bold in war; END
BEGIN NOW Vast are their fields, and tillage is their care,) END
BEGIN NOW A hospitable realm while Fate was kind, END
BEGIN NOW With Troy in friendship and religion join'd. END
BEGIN NOW I land; with luckless omens then adore END
BEGIN NOW Their gods, and draw a line along the shore; END
BEGIN NOW I lay the deep foundations of a wall, END
BEGIN NOW And Aenos, nam'd from me, the city call. END
BEGIN NOW To Dionaean Venus vows are paid, END
BEGIN NOW And all the pow'rs that rising labors aid; END
BEGIN NOW A bull on Jove's imperial altar laid. END
BEGIN NOW Not far, a rising hillock stood in view; END
BEGIN NOW Sharp myrtles on the sides, and cornels grew. END
BEGIN NOW There, while I went to crop the sylvan scenes, END
BEGIN NOW And shade our altar with their leafy greens, END
BEGIN NOW I pull'd a plant- with horror I relate END
BEGIN NOW A prodigy so strange and full of fate. END
BEGIN NOW The rooted fibers rose, and from the wound END
BEGIN NOW Black bloody drops distill'd upon the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Mute and amaz'd, my hair with terror stood; END
BEGIN NOW Fear shrunk my sinews, and congeal'd my blood. END
BEGIN NOW Mann'd once again, another plant I try: END
BEGIN NOW That other gush'd with the same sanguine dye. END
BEGIN NOW Then, fearing guilt for some offense unknown, END
BEGIN NOW With pray'rs and vows the Dryads I atone, END
BEGIN NOW With all the sisters of the woods, and most END
BEGIN NOW The God of Arms, who rules the Thracian coast, END
BEGIN NOW That they, or he, these omens would avert, END
BEGIN NOW Release our fears, and better signs impart. END
BEGIN NOW Clear'd, as I thought, and fully fix'd at length END
BEGIN NOW To learn the cause, I tugged with all my strength: END
BEGIN NOW I bent my knees against the ground; once more END
BEGIN NOW The violated myrtle ran with gore. END
BEGIN NOW Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb END
BEGIN NOW Of wounded earth, and caverns of the tomb, END
BEGIN NOW A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew'd END
BEGIN NOW My fright, and then these dreadful words ensued: END
BEGIN NOW 'Why dost thou thus my buried body rend? END
BEGIN NOW O spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend! END
BEGIN NOW Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood: END
BEGIN NOW The tears distil not from the wounded wood; END
BEGIN NOW But ev'ry drop this living tree contains END
BEGIN NOW Is kindred blood, and ran in Trojan veins. END
BEGIN NOW O fly from this unhospitable shore, END
BEGIN NOW Warn'd by my fate; for I am Polydore! END
BEGIN NOW Here loads of lances, in my blood embrued, END
BEGIN NOW Again shoot upward, by my blood renew'd.' END
BEGIN NOW My falt'ring tongue and shiv'ring limbs declare END
BEGIN NOW My horror, and in bristles rose my hair. END
BEGIN NOW When Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent, END
BEGIN NOW Old Priam, fearful of the war's event, END
BEGIN NOW This hapless Polydore to Thracia sent: END
BEGIN NOW Loaded with gold, he sent his darling, far END
BEGIN NOW From noise and tumults, and destructive war, END
BEGIN NOW Committed to the faithless tyrant's care; END
BEGIN NOW Who, when he saw the pow'r of Troy decline, END
BEGIN NOW Forsook the weaker, with the strong to join; END
BEGIN NOW Broke ev'ry bond of nature and of truth, END
BEGIN NOW And murder'd, for his wealth, the royal youth. END
BEGIN NOW O sacred hunger of pernicious gold! END
BEGIN NOW What bands of faith can impious lucre hold? END
BEGIN NOW Now, when my soul had shaken off her fears, END
BEGIN NOW I call my father and the Trojan peers; END
BEGIN NOW Relate the prodigies of Heav'n, require END
BEGIN NOW What he commands, and their advice desire. END
BEGIN NOW All vote to leave that execrable shore, END
BEGIN NOW Polluted with the blood of Polydore; END
BEGIN NOW But, ere we sail, his fun'ral rites prepare, END
BEGIN NOW Then, to his ghost, a tomb and altars rear. END
BEGIN NOW In mournful pomp the matrons walk the round, END
BEGIN NOW With baleful cypress and blue fillets crown'd, END
BEGIN NOW With eyes dejected, and with hair unbound. END
BEGIN NOW Then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour, END
BEGIN NOW And thrice invoke the soul of Polydore. END
BEGIN NOW Now, when the raging storms no longer reign, END
BEGIN NOW But southern gales invite us to the main, END
BEGIN NOW We launch our vessels, with a prosp'rous wind, END
BEGIN NOW And leave the cities and the shores behind. END
BEGIN NOW An island in th' Aegaean main appears; END
BEGIN NOW Neptune and wat'ry Doris claim it theirs. END
BEGIN NOW It floated once, till Phoebus fix'd the sides END
BEGIN NOW To rooted earth, and now it braves the tides. END
BEGIN NOW Here, borne by friendly winds, we come ashore, END
BEGIN NOW With needful ease our weary limbs restore, END
BEGIN NOW And the Sun's temple and his town adore. END
BEGIN NOW Anius, the priest and king, with laurel crown'd, END
BEGIN NOW His hoary locks with purple fillets bound, END
BEGIN NOW Who saw my sire the Delian shore ascend, END
BEGIN NOW Came forth with eager haste to meet his friend; END
BEGIN NOW Invites him to his palace; and, in sign END
BEGIN NOW Of ancient love, their plighted hands they join. END
BEGIN NOW Then to the temple of the god I went, END
BEGIN NOW And thus, before the shrine, my vows present: END
BEGIN NOW 'Give, O Thymbraeus, give a resting place END
BEGIN NOW To the sad relics of the Trojan race; END
BEGIN NOW A seat secure, a region of their own, END
BEGIN NOW A lasting empire, and a happier town. END
BEGIN NOW Where shall we fix? where shall our labors end? END
BEGIN NOW Whom shall we follow, and what fate attend? END
BEGIN NOW Let not my pray'rs a doubtful answer find; END
BEGIN NOW But in clear auguries unveil thy mind.' END
BEGIN NOW Scarce had I said: he shook the holy ground, END
BEGIN NOW The laurels, and the lofty hills around; END
BEGIN NOW And from the tripos rush'd a bellowing sound. END
BEGIN NOW Prostrate we fell; confess'd the present god, END
BEGIN NOW Who gave this answer from his dark abode: END
BEGIN NOW 'Undaunted youths, go, seek that mother earth END
BEGIN NOW From which your ancestors derive their birth. END
BEGIN NOW The soil that sent you forth, her ancient race END
BEGIN NOW In her old bosom shall again embrace. END
BEGIN NOW Thro' the wide world th' Aeneian house shall reign, END
BEGIN NOW And children's children shall the crown sustain.' END
BEGIN NOW Thus Phoebus did our future fates disclose: END
BEGIN NOW A mighty tumult, mix'd with joy, arose. END
BEGIN NOW All are concern'd to know what place the god END
BEGIN NOW Assign'd, and where determin'd our abode. END
BEGIN NOW My father, long revolving in his mind END
BEGIN NOW The race and lineage of the Trojan kind, END
BEGIN NOW Thus answer'd their demands: 'Ye princes, hear END
BEGIN NOW Your pleasing fortune, and dispel your fear. END
BEGIN NOW The fruitful isle of Crete, well known to fame, END
BEGIN NOW Sacred of old to Jove's imperial name, END
BEGIN NOW In the mid ocean lies, with large command, END
BEGIN NOW And on its plains a hundred cities stand. END
BEGIN NOW Another Ida rises there, and we END
BEGIN NOW From thence derive our Trojan ancestry. END
BEGIN NOW From thence, as 't is divulg'd by certain fame, END
BEGIN NOW To the Rhoetean shores old Teucrus came; END
BEGIN NOW There fix'd, and there the seat of empire chose, END
BEGIN NOW Ere Ilium and the Trojan tow'rs arose. END
BEGIN NOW In humble vales they built their soft abodes, END
BEGIN NOW Till Cybele, the mother of the gods, END
BEGIN NOW With tinkling cymbals charm'd th' Idaean woods, END
BEGIN NOW She secret rites and ceremonies taught, END
BEGIN NOW And to the yoke the savage lions brought. END
BEGIN NOW Let us the land which Heav'n appoints, explore; END
BEGIN NOW Appease the winds, and seek the Gnossian shore. END
BEGIN NOW If Jove assists the passage of our fleet, END
BEGIN NOW The third propitious dawn discovers Crete.' END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, the sacrifices, laid END
BEGIN NOW On smoking altars, to the gods he paid: END
BEGIN NOW A bull, to Neptune an oblation due, END
BEGIN NOW Another bull to bright Apollo slew; END
BEGIN NOW A milk-white ewe, the western winds to please, END
BEGIN NOW And one coal-black, to calm the stormy seas. END
BEGIN NOW Ere this, a flying rumor had been spread END
BEGIN NOW That fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled, END
BEGIN NOW Expell'd and exil'd; that the coast was free END
BEGIN NOW From foreign or domestic enemy. END
BEGIN NOW We leave the Delian ports, and put to sea; END
BEGIN NOW By Naxos, fam'd for vintage, make our way; END
BEGIN NOW Then green Donysa pass; and sail in sight END
BEGIN NOW Of Paros' isle, with marble quarries white. END
BEGIN NOW We pass the scatter'd isles of Cyclades, END
BEGIN NOW That, scarce distinguish'd, seem to stud the seas. END
BEGIN NOW The shouts of sailors double near the shores; END
BEGIN NOW They stretch their canvas, and they ply their oars. END
BEGIN NOW 'All hands aloft! for Crete! for Crete!' they cry, END
BEGIN NOW And swiftly thro' the foamy billows fly. END
BEGIN NOW Full on the promis'd land at length we bore, END
BEGIN NOW With joy descending on the Cretan shore. END
BEGIN NOW With eager haste a rising town I frame, END
BEGIN NOW Which from the Trojan Pergamus I name: END
BEGIN NOW The name itself was grateful; I exhort END
BEGIN NOW To found their houses, and erect a fort. END
BEGIN NOW Our ships are haul'd upon the yellow strand; END
BEGIN NOW The youth begin to till the labor'd land; END
BEGIN NOW And I myself new marriages promote, END
BEGIN NOW Give laws, and dwellings I divide by lot; END
BEGIN NOW When rising vapors choke the wholesome air, END
BEGIN NOW And blasts of noisome winds corrupt the year; END
BEGIN NOW The trees devouring caterpillars burn; END
BEGIN NOW Parch'd was the grass, and blighted was the corn: END
BEGIN NOW Nor 'scape the beasts; for Sirius, from on high, END
BEGIN NOW With pestilential heat infects the sky: END
BEGIN NOW My men- some fall, the rest in fevers fry. END
BEGIN NOW Again my father bids me seek the shore END
BEGIN NOW Of sacred Delos, and the god implore, END
BEGIN NOW To learn what end of woes we might expect, END
BEGIN NOW And to what clime our weary course direct. END
BEGIN NOW 'T was night, when ev'ry creature, void of cares, END
BEGIN NOW The common gift of balmy slumber shares: END
BEGIN NOW The statues of my gods (for such they seem'd), END
BEGIN NOW Those gods whom I from flaming Troy redeem'd, END
BEGIN NOW Before me stood, majestically bright, END
BEGIN NOW Full in the beams of Phoebe's ent'ring light. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus they spoke, and eas'd my troubled mind: END
BEGIN NOW 'What from the Delian god thou go'st to find, END
BEGIN NOW He tells thee here, and sends us to relate. END
BEGIN NOW Those pow'rs are we, companions of thy fate, END
BEGIN NOW Who from the burning town by thee were brought, END
BEGIN NOW Thy fortune follow'd, and thy safety wrought. END
BEGIN NOW Thro' seas and lands as we thy steps attend, END
BEGIN NOW So shall our care thy glorious race befriend. END
BEGIN NOW An ample realm for thee thy fates ordain, END
BEGIN NOW A town that o'er the conquer'd world shall reign. END
BEGIN NOW Thou, mighty walls for mighty nations build; END
BEGIN NOW Nor let thy weary mind to labors yield: END
BEGIN NOW But change thy seat; for not the Delian god, END
BEGIN NOW Nor we, have giv'n thee Crete for our abode. END
BEGIN NOW A land there is, Hesperia call'd of old, END
BEGIN NOW (The soil is fruitful, and the natives bold- END
BEGIN NOW Th' Oenotrians held it once,) by later fame END
BEGIN NOW Now call'd Italia, from the leader's name. END
BEGIN NOW lasius there and Dardanus were born; END
BEGIN NOW From thence we came, and thither must return. END
BEGIN NOW Rise, and thy sire with these glad tidings greet. END
BEGIN NOW Search Italy; for Jove denies thee Crete.' END
BEGIN NOW Astonish'd at their voices and their sight, END
BEGIN NOW (Nor were they dreams, but visions of the night; END
BEGIN NOW I saw, I knew their faces, and descried, END
BEGIN NOW In perfect view, their hair with fillets tied;) END
BEGIN NOW I started from my couch; a clammy sweat END
BEGIN NOW On all my limbs and shiv'ring body sate. END
BEGIN NOW To heav'n I lift my hands with pious haste, END
BEGIN NOW And sacred incense in the flames I cast. END
BEGIN NOW Thus to the gods their perfect honors done, END
BEGIN NOW More cheerful, to my good old sire I run, END
BEGIN NOW And tell the pleasing news. In little space END
BEGIN NOW He found his error of the double race; END
BEGIN NOW Not, as before he deem'd, deriv'd from Crete; END
BEGIN NOW No more deluded by the doubtful seat: END
BEGIN NOW Then said: 'O son, turmoil'd in Trojan fate! END
BEGIN NOW Such things as these Cassandra did relate. END
BEGIN NOW This day revives within my mind what she END
BEGIN NOW Foretold of Troy renew'd in Italy, END
BEGIN NOW And Latian lands; but who could then have thought END
BEGIN NOW That Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought, END
BEGIN NOW Or who believ'd what mad Cassandra taught? END
BEGIN NOW Now let us go where Phoebus leads the way.' END
BEGIN NOW He said; and we with glad consent obey, END
BEGIN NOW Forsake the seat, and, leaving few behind, END
BEGIN NOW We spread our sails before the willing wind. END
BEGIN NOW Now from the sight of land our galleys move, END
BEGIN NOW With only seas around and skies above; END
BEGIN NOW When o'er our heads descends a burst of rain, END
BEGIN NOW And night with sable clouds involves the main; END
BEGIN NOW The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise; END
BEGIN NOW The scatter'd fleet is forc'd to sev'ral ways; END
BEGIN NOW The face of heav'n is ravish'd from our eyes, END
BEGIN NOW And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies. END
BEGIN NOW Cast from our course, we wander in the dark. END
BEGIN NOW No stars to guide, no point of land to mark. END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n Palinurus no distinction found END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt the night and day; such darkness reign'd around. END
BEGIN NOW Three starless nights the doubtful navy strays, END
BEGIN NOW Without distinction, and three sunless days; END
BEGIN NOW The fourth renews the light, and, from our shrouds, END
BEGIN NOW We view a rising land, like distant clouds; END
BEGIN NOW The mountain-tops confirm the pleasing sight, END
BEGIN NOW And curling smoke ascending from their height. END
BEGIN NOW The canvas falls; their oars the sailors ply; END
BEGIN NOW From the rude strokes the whirling waters fly. END
BEGIN NOW At length I land upon the Strophades, END
BEGIN NOW Safe from the danger of the stormy seas. END
BEGIN NOW Those isles are compass'd by th' Ionian main, END
BEGIN NOW The dire abode where the foul Harpies reign, END
BEGIN NOW Forc'd by the winged warriors to repair END
BEGIN NOW To their old homes, and leave their costly fare. END
BEGIN NOW Monsters more fierce offended Heav'n ne'er sent END
BEGIN NOW From hell's abyss, for human punishment: END
BEGIN NOW With virgin faces, but with wombs obscene, END
BEGIN NOW Foul paunches, and with ordure still unclean; END
BEGIN NOW With claws for hands, and looks for ever lean. END
BEGIN NOW We landed at the port, and soon beheld END
BEGIN NOW Fat herds of oxen graze the flow'ry field, END
BEGIN NOW And wanton goats without a keeper stray'd. END
BEGIN NOW With weapons we the welcome prey invade, END
BEGIN NOW Then call the gods for partners of our feast, END
BEGIN NOW And Jove himself, the chief invited guest. END
BEGIN NOW We spread the tables on the greensward ground; END
BEGIN NOW We feed with hunger, and the bowls go round; END
BEGIN NOW When from the mountain-tops, with hideous cry, END
BEGIN NOW And clatt'ring wings, the hungry Harpies fly; END
BEGIN NOW They snatch the meat, defiling all they find, END
BEGIN NOW And, parting, leave a loathsome stench behind. END
BEGIN NOW Close by a hollow rock, again we sit, END
BEGIN NOW New dress the dinner, and the beds refit, END
BEGIN NOW Secure from sight, beneath a pleasing shade, END
BEGIN NOW Where tufted trees a native arbor made. END
BEGIN NOW Again the holy fires on altars burn; END
BEGIN NOW And once again the rav'nous birds return, END
BEGIN NOW Or from the dark recesses where they lie, END
BEGIN NOW Or from another quarter of the sky; END
BEGIN NOW With filthy claws their odious meal repeat, END
BEGIN NOW And mix their loathsome ordures with their meat. END
BEGIN NOW I bid my friends for vengeance then prepare, END
BEGIN NOW And with the hellish nation wage the war. END
BEGIN NOW They, as commanded, for the fight provide, END
BEGIN NOW And in the grass their glitt'ring weapons hide; END
BEGIN NOW Then, when along the crooked shore we hear END
BEGIN NOW Their clatt'ring wings, and saw the foes appear, END
BEGIN NOW Misenus sounds a charge: we take th' alarm, END
BEGIN NOW And our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm. END
BEGIN NOW In this new kind of combat all employ END
BEGIN NOW Their utmost force, the monsters to destroy. END
BEGIN NOW In vain- the fated skin is proof to wounds; END
BEGIN NOW And from their plumes the shining sword rebounds. END
BEGIN NOW At length rebuff'd, they leave their mangled prey, END
BEGIN NOW And their stretch'd pinions to the skies display. END
BEGIN NOW Yet one remain'd- the messenger of Fate: END
BEGIN NOW High on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate, END
BEGIN NOW And thus her dismal errand did relate: END
BEGIN NOW 'What! not contented with our oxen slain, END
BEGIN NOW Dare you with Heav'n an impious war maintain, END
BEGIN NOW And drive the Harpies from their native reign? END
BEGIN NOW Heed therefore what I say; and keep in mind END
BEGIN NOW What Jove decrees, what Phoebus has design'd, END
BEGIN NOW And I, the Furies' queen, from both relate- END
BEGIN NOW You seek th' Italian shores, foredoom'd by fate: END
BEGIN NOW Th' Italian shores are granted you to find, END
BEGIN NOW And a safe passage to the port assign'd. END
BEGIN NOW But know, that ere your promis'd walls you build, END
BEGIN NOW My curses shall severely be fulfill'd. END
BEGIN NOW Fierce famine is your lot for this misdeed, END
BEGIN NOW Reduc'd to grind the plates on which you feed.' END
BEGIN NOW She said, and to the neighb'ring forest flew. END
BEGIN NOW Our courage fails us, and our fears renew. END
BEGIN NOW Hopeless to win by war, to pray'rs we fall, END
BEGIN NOW And on th' offended Harpies humbly call, END
BEGIN NOW And whether gods or birds obscene they were, END
BEGIN NOW Our vows for pardon and for peace prefer. END
BEGIN NOW But old Anchises, off'ring sacrifice, END
BEGIN NOW And lifting up to heav'n his hands and eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Ador'd the greater gods: 'Avert,' said he, END
BEGIN NOW 'These omens; render vain this prophecy, END
BEGIN NOW And from th' impending curse a pious people free!' END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, he bids us put to sea; END
BEGIN NOW We loose from shore our haulsers, and obey, END
BEGIN NOW And soon with swelling sails pursue the wat'ry way. END
BEGIN NOW Amidst our course, Zacynthian woods appear; END
BEGIN NOW And next by rocky Neritos we steer: END
BEGIN NOW We fly from Ithaca's detested shore, END
BEGIN NOW And curse the land which dire Ulysses bore. END
BEGIN NOW At length Leucate's cloudy top appears, END
BEGIN NOW And the Sun's temple, which the sailor fears. END
BEGIN NOW Resolv'd to breathe a while from labor past, END
BEGIN NOW Our crooked anchors from the prow we cast, END
BEGIN NOW And joyful to the little city haste. END
BEGIN NOW Here, safe beyond our hopes, our vows we pay END
BEGIN NOW To Jove, the guide and patron of our way. END
BEGIN NOW The customs of our country we pursue, END
BEGIN NOW And Trojan games on Actian shores renew. END
BEGIN NOW Our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil, END
BEGIN NOW And exercise the wrastlers' noble toil; END
BEGIN NOW Pleas'd to have sail'd so long before the wind, END
BEGIN NOW And left so many Grecian towns behind. END
BEGIN NOW The sun had now fulfill'd his annual course, END
BEGIN NOW And Boreas on the seas display'd his force: END
BEGIN NOW I fix'd upon the temple's lofty door END
BEGIN NOW The brazen shield which vanquish'd Abas bore; END
BEGIN NOW The verse beneath my name and action speaks: END
BEGIN NOW 'These arms Aeneas took from conqu'ring Greeks.' END
BEGIN NOW Then I command to weigh; the seamen ply END
BEGIN NOW Their sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly. END
BEGIN NOW The sight of high Phaeacia soon we lost, END
BEGIN NOW And skimm'd along Epirus' rocky coast. END
BEGIN NOW Then to Chaonia's port our course we bend, END
BEGIN NOW And, landed, to Buthrotus' heights ascend. END
BEGIN NOW Here wondrous things were loudly blaz'd fame: END
BEGIN NOW How Helenus reviv'd the Trojan name, END
BEGIN NOW And reign'd in Greece; that Priam's captive son END
BEGIN NOW Succeeded Pyrrhus in his bed and throne; END
BEGIN NOW And fair Andromache, restor'd by fate, END
BEGIN NOW Once more was happy in a Trojan mate. END
BEGIN NOW I leave my galleys riding in the port, END
BEGIN NOW And long to see the new Dardanian court. END
BEGIN NOW By chance, the mournful queen, before the gate, END
BEGIN NOW Then solemniz'd her former husband's fate. END
BEGIN NOW Green altars, rais'd of turf, with gifts she crown'd, END
BEGIN NOW And sacred priests in order stand around, END
BEGIN NOW And thrice the name of hapless Hector sound. END
BEGIN NOW The grove itself resembles Ida's wood; END
BEGIN NOW And Simois seem'd the well-dissembled flood. END
BEGIN NOW But when at nearer distance she beheld END
BEGIN NOW My shining armor and my Trojan shield, END
BEGIN NOW Astonish'd at the sight, the vital heat END
BEGIN NOW Forsakes her limbs; her veins no longer beat: END
BEGIN NOW She faints, she falls, and scarce recov'ring strength, END
BEGIN NOW Thus, with a falt'ring tongue, she speaks at length: END
BEGIN NOW 'Are you alive, O goddess-born?' she said, END
BEGIN NOW 'Or if a ghost, then where is Hector's shade?' END
BEGIN NOW At this, she cast a loud and frightful cry. END
BEGIN NOW With broken words I made this brief reply: END
BEGIN NOW 'All of me that remains appears in sight; END
BEGIN NOW I live, if living be to loathe the light. END
BEGIN NOW No phantom; but I drag a wretched life, END
BEGIN NOW My fate resembling that of Hector's wife. END
BEGIN NOW What have you suffer'd since you lost your lord? END
BEGIN NOW By what strange blessing are you now restor'd? END
BEGIN NOW Still are you Hector's? or is Hector fled, END
BEGIN NOW And his remembrance lost in Pyrrhus' bed?' END
BEGIN NOW With eyes dejected, in a lowly tone, END
BEGIN NOW After a modest pause she thus begun: END
BEGIN NOW 'O only happy maid of Priam's race, END
BEGIN NOW Whom death deliver'd from the foes' embrace! END
BEGIN NOW Commanded on Achilles' tomb to die, END
BEGIN NOW Not forc'd, like us, to hard captivity, END
BEGIN NOW Or in a haughty master's arms to lie. END
BEGIN NOW In Grecian ships unhappy we were borne, END
BEGIN NOW Endur'd the victor's lust, sustain'd the scorn: END
BEGIN NOW Thus I submitted to the lawless pride END
BEGIN NOW Of Pyrrhus, more a handmaid than a bride. END
BEGIN NOW Cloy'd with possession, he forsook my bed, END
BEGIN NOW And Helen's lovely daughter sought to wed; END
BEGIN NOW Then me to Trojan Helenus resign'd, END
BEGIN NOW And his two slaves in equal marriage join'd; END
BEGIN NOW Till young Orestes, pierc'd with deep despair, END
BEGIN NOW And longing to redeem the promis'd fair, END
BEGIN NOW Before Apollo's altar slew the ravisher. END
BEGIN NOW By Pyrrhus' death the kingdom we regain'd: END
BEGIN NOW At least one half with Helenus remain'd. END
BEGIN NOW Our part, from Chaon, he Chaonia calls, END
BEGIN NOW And names from Pergamus his rising walls. END
BEGIN NOW But you, what fates have landed on our coast? END
BEGIN NOW What gods have sent you, or what storms have toss'd? END
BEGIN NOW Does young Ascanius life and health enjoy, END
BEGIN NOW Sav'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy? END
BEGIN NOW O tell me how his mother's loss he bears, END
BEGIN NOW What hopes are promis'd from his blooming years, END
BEGIN NOW How much of Hector in his face appears?' END
BEGIN NOW She spoke; and mix'd her speech with mournful cries, END
BEGIN NOW And fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes. END
BEGIN NOW At length her lord descends upon the plain, END
BEGIN NOW In pomp, attended with a num'rous train; END
BEGIN NOW Receives his friends, and to the city leads, END
BEGIN NOW And tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds. END
BEGIN NOW Proceeding on, another Troy I see, END
BEGIN NOW Or, in less compass, Troy's epitome. END
BEGIN NOW A riv'let by the name of Xanthus ran, END
BEGIN NOW And I embrace the Scaean gate again. END
BEGIN NOW My friends in porticoes were entertain'd, END
BEGIN NOW And feasts and pleasures thro' the city reign'd. END
BEGIN NOW The tables fill'd the spacious hall around, END
BEGIN NOW And golden bowls with sparkling wine were crown'd. END
BEGIN NOW Two days we pass'd in mirth, till friendly gales, END
BEGIN NOW Blown from the supplied our swelling sails. END
BEGIN NOW Then to the royal seer I thus began: END
BEGIN NOW 'O thou, who know'st, beyond the reach of man, END
BEGIN NOW The laws of heav'n, and what the stars decree; END
BEGIN NOW Whom Phoebus taught unerring prophecy, END
BEGIN NOW From his own tripod, and his holy tree; END
BEGIN NOW Skill'd in the wing'd inhabitants of air, END
BEGIN NOW What auspices their notes and flights declare: END
BEGIN NOW O say- for all religious rites portend END
BEGIN NOW A happy voyage, and a prosp'rous end; END
BEGIN NOW And ev'ry power and omen of the sky END
BEGIN NOW Direct my course for destin'd Italy; END
BEGIN NOW But only dire Celaeno, from the gods, END
BEGIN NOW A dismal famine fatally forebodes- END
BEGIN NOW O say what dangers I am first to shun, END
BEGIN NOW What toils vanquish, and what course to run.' END
BEGIN NOW The prophet first with sacrifice adores END
BEGIN NOW The greater gods; their pardon then implores; END
BEGIN NOW Unbinds the fillet from his holy head; END
BEGIN NOW To Phoebus, next, my trembling steps he led, END
BEGIN NOW Full of religious doubts and awful dread. END
BEGIN NOW Then, with his god possess'd, before the shrine, END
BEGIN NOW These words proceeded from his mouth divine: END
BEGIN NOW 'O goddess-born, (for Heav'n's appointed will, END
BEGIN NOW With greater auspices of good than ill, END
BEGIN NOW Foreshows thy voyage, and thy course directs; END
BEGIN NOW Thy fates conspire, and Jove himself protects,) END
BEGIN NOW Of many things some few I shall explain, END
BEGIN NOW Teach thee to shun the dangers of the main, END
BEGIN NOW And how at length the promis'd shore to gain. END
BEGIN NOW The rest the fates from Helenus conceal, END
BEGIN NOW And Juno's angry pow'r forbids to tell. END
BEGIN NOW First, then, that happy shore, that seems so nigh, END
BEGIN NOW Will far from your deluded wishes fly; END
BEGIN NOW Long tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy: END
BEGIN NOW For you must cruise along Sicilian shores, END
BEGIN NOW And stem the currents with your struggling oars; END
BEGIN NOW Then round th' Italian coast your navy steer; END
BEGIN NOW And, after this, to Circe's island veer; END
BEGIN NOW And, last, before your new foundations rise, END
BEGIN NOW Must pass the Stygian lake, and view the nether skies. END
BEGIN NOW Now mark the signs of future ease and rest, END
BEGIN NOW And bear them safely treasur'd in thy breast. END
BEGIN NOW When, in the shady shelter of a wood, END
BEGIN NOW And near the margin of a gentle flood, END
BEGIN NOW Thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground, END
BEGIN NOW With thirty sucking young encompass'd round; END
BEGIN NOW The dam and offspring white as falling snow- END
BEGIN NOW These on thy city shall their name bestow, END
BEGIN NOW And there shall end thy labors and thy woe. END
BEGIN NOW Nor let the threaten'd famine fright thy mind, END
BEGIN NOW For Phoebus will assist, and Fate the way will find. END
BEGIN NOW Let not thy course to that ill coast be bent, END
BEGIN NOW Which fronts from far th' Epirian continent: END
BEGIN NOW Those parts are all by Grecian foes possess'd; END
BEGIN NOW The salvage Locrians here the shores infest; END
BEGIN NOW There fierce Idomeneus his city builds, END
BEGIN NOW And guards with arms the Salentinian fields; END
BEGIN NOW And on the mountain's brow Petilia stands, END
BEGIN NOW Which Philoctetes with his troops commands. END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n when thy fleet is landed on the shore, END
BEGIN NOW And priests with holy vows the gods adore, END
BEGIN NOW Then with a purple veil involve your eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Lest hostile faces blast the sacrifice. END
BEGIN NOW These rites and customs to the rest commend, END
BEGIN NOW That to your pious race they may descend. END
BEGIN NOW 'When, parted hence, the wind, that ready waits END
BEGIN NOW For Sicily, shall bear you to the straits END
BEGIN NOW Where proud Pelorus opes a wider way, END
BEGIN NOW Tack to the larboard, and stand off to sea: END
BEGIN NOW Veer starboard sea and land. Th' Italian shore END
BEGIN NOW And fair Sicilia's coast were one, before END
BEGIN NOW An earthquake caus'd the flaw: the roaring tides END
BEGIN NOW The passage broke that land from land divides; END
BEGIN NOW And where the lands retir'd, the rushing ocean rides. END
BEGIN NOW Distinguish'd by the straits, on either hand, END
BEGIN NOW Now rising cities in long order stand, END
BEGIN NOW And fruitful fields: so much can time invade END
BEGIN NOW The mold'ring work that beauteous Nature made. END
BEGIN NOW Far on the right, her dogs foul Scylla hides: END
BEGIN NOW Charybdis roaring on the left presides, END
BEGIN NOW And in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides; END
BEGIN NOW Then spouts them from below: with fury driv'n, END
BEGIN NOW The waves mount up and wash the face of heav'n. END
BEGIN NOW But Scylla from her den, with open jaws, END
BEGIN NOW The sinking vessel in her eddy draws, END
BEGIN NOW Then dashes on the rocks. A human face, END
BEGIN NOW And virgin bosom, hides her tail's disgrace: END
BEGIN NOW Her parts obscene below the waves descend, END
BEGIN NOW With dogs inclos'd, and in a dolphin end. END
BEGIN NOW 'T is safer, then, to bear aloof to sea, END
BEGIN NOW And coast Pachynus, tho' with more delay, END
BEGIN NOW Than once to view misshapen Scylla near, END
BEGIN NOW And the loud yell of wat'ry wolves to hear. END
BEGIN NOW 'Besides, if faith to Helenus be due, END
BEGIN NOW And if prophetic Phoebus tell me true, END
BEGIN NOW Do not this precept of your friend forget, END
BEGIN NOW Which therefore more than once I must repeat: END
BEGIN NOW Above the rest, great Juno's name adore; END
BEGIN NOW Pay vows to Juno; Juno's aid implore. END
BEGIN NOW Let gifts be to the mighty queen design'd, END
BEGIN NOW And mollify with pray'rs her haughty mind. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, at the length, your passage shall be free, END
BEGIN NOW And you shall safe descend on Italy. END
BEGIN NOW Arriv'd at Cumae, when you view the flood END
BEGIN NOW Of black Avernus, and the sounding wood, END
BEGIN NOW The mad prophetic Sibyl you shall find, END
BEGIN NOW Dark in a cave, and on a rock reclin'd. END
BEGIN NOW She sings the fates, and, in her frantic fits, END
BEGIN NOW The notes and names, inscrib'd, to leafs commits. END
BEGIN NOW What she commits to leafs, in order laid, END
BEGIN NOW Before the cavern's entrance are display'd: END
BEGIN NOW Unmov'd they lie; but, if a blast of wind END
BEGIN NOW Without, or vapors issue from behind, END
BEGIN NOW The leafs are borne aloft in liquid air, END
BEGIN NOW And she resumes no more her museful care, END
BEGIN NOW Nor gathers from the rocks her scatter'd verse, END
BEGIN NOW Nor sets in order what the winds disperse. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, many not succeeding, most upbraid END
BEGIN NOW The madness of the visionary maid, END
BEGIN NOW And with loud curses leave the mystic shade. END
BEGIN NOW 'Think it not loss of time a while to stay, END
BEGIN NOW Tho' thy companions chide thy long delay; END
BEGIN NOW Tho' summon'd to the seas, tho' pleasing gales END
BEGIN NOW Invite thy course, and stretch thy swelling sails: END
BEGIN NOW But beg the sacred priestess to relate END
BEGIN NOW With willing words, and not to write thy fate. END
BEGIN NOW The fierce Italian people she will show, END
BEGIN NOW And all thy wars, and all thy future woe, END
BEGIN NOW And what thou may'st avoid, and what must undergo. END
BEGIN NOW She shall direct thy course, instruct thy mind, END
BEGIN NOW And teach thee how the happy shores to find. END
BEGIN NOW This is what Heav'n allows me to relate: END
BEGIN NOW Now part in peace; pursue thy better fate, END
BEGIN NOW And raise, by strength of arms, the Trojan state.' END
BEGIN NOW This when the priest with friendly voice declar'd, END
BEGIN NOW He gave me license, and rich gifts prepar'd: END
BEGIN NOW Bounteous of treasure, he supplied my want END
BEGIN NOW With heavy gold, and polish'd elephant; END
BEGIN NOW Then Dodonaean caldrons put on board, END
BEGIN NOW And ev'ry ship with sums of silver stor'd. END
BEGIN NOW A trusty coat of mail to me he sent, END
BEGIN NOW Thrice chain'd with gold, for use and ornament; END
BEGIN NOW The helm of Pyrrhus added to the rest, END
BEGIN NOW That flourish'd with a plume and waving crest. END
BEGIN NOW Nor was my sire forgotten, nor my friends; END
BEGIN NOW And large recruits he to my navy sends: END
BEGIN NOW Men, horses, captains, arms, and warlike stores; END
BEGIN NOW Supplies new pilots, and new sweeping oars. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime, my sire commands to hoist our sails, END
BEGIN NOW Lest we should lose the first auspicious gales. END
BEGIN NOW The prophet bless'd the parting crew, and last, END
BEGIN NOW With words like these, his ancient friend embrac'd: END
BEGIN NOW 'Old happy man, the care of gods above, END
BEGIN NOW Whom heav'nly Venus honor'd with her love, END
BEGIN NOW And twice preserv'd thy life, when Troy was lost, END
BEGIN NOW Behold from far the wish'd Ausonian coast: END
BEGIN NOW There land; but take a larger compass round, END
BEGIN NOW For that before is all forbidden ground. END
BEGIN NOW The shore that Phoebus has design'd for you, END
BEGIN NOW At farther distance lies, conceal'd from view. END
BEGIN NOW Go happy hence, and seek your new abodes, END
BEGIN NOW Blest in a son, and favor'd by the gods: END
BEGIN NOW For I with useless words prolong your stay, END
BEGIN NOW When southern gales have summon'd you away.' END
BEGIN NOW Nor less the queen our parting thence deplor'd, END
BEGIN NOW Nor was less bounteous than her Trojan lord. END
BEGIN NOW A noble present to my son she brought, END
BEGIN NOW A robe with flow'rs on golden tissue wrought, END
BEGIN NOW A phrygian vest; and loads with gifts beside END
BEGIN NOW Of precious texture, and of Asian pride. END
BEGIN NOW 'Accept,' she said, 'these monuments of love, END
BEGIN NOW Which in my youth with happier hands I wove: END
BEGIN NOW Regard these trifles for the giver's sake; END
BEGIN NOW 'T is the last present Hector's wife can make. END
BEGIN NOW Thou call'st my lost Astyanax to mind; END
BEGIN NOW In thee his features and his form I find: END
BEGIN NOW His eyes so sparkled with a lively flame; END
BEGIN NOW Such were his motions; such was all his frame; END
BEGIN NOW And ah! had Heav'n so pleas'd, his years had been the same.' END
BEGIN NOW With tears I took my last adieu, and said: END
BEGIN NOW 'Your fortune, happy pair, already made, END
BEGIN NOW Leaves you no farther wish. My diff'rent state, END
BEGIN NOW Avoiding one, incurs another fate. END
BEGIN NOW To you a quiet seat the gods allow: END
BEGIN NOW You have no shores to search, no seas to plow, END
BEGIN NOW Nor fields of flying Italy to chase: END
BEGIN NOW (Deluding visions, and a vain embrace!) END
BEGIN NOW You see another Simois, and enjoy END
BEGIN NOW The labor of your hands, another Troy, END
BEGIN NOW With better auspice than her ancient tow'rs, END
BEGIN NOW And less obnoxious to the Grecian pow'rs. END
BEGIN NOW If e'er the gods, whom I with vows adore, END
BEGIN NOW Conduct my steps to Tiber's happy shore; END
BEGIN NOW If ever I ascend the Latian throne, END
BEGIN NOW And build a city I may call my own; END
BEGIN NOW As both of us our birth from Troy derive, END
BEGIN NOW So let our kindred lines in concord live, END
BEGIN NOW And both in acts of equal friendship strive. END
BEGIN NOW Our fortunes, good or bad, shall be the same: END
BEGIN NOW The double Troy shall differ but in name; END
BEGIN NOW That what we now begin may never end, END
BEGIN NOW But long to late posterity descend.' END
BEGIN NOW Near the Ceraunian rocks our course we bore; END
BEGIN NOW The shortest passage to th' Italian shore. END
BEGIN NOW Now had the sun withdrawn his radiant light, END
BEGIN NOW And hills were hid in dusky shades of night: END
BEGIN NOW We land, and, on the bosom Of the ground, END
BEGIN NOW A safe retreat and a bare lodging found. END
BEGIN NOW Close by the shore we lay; the sailors keep END
BEGIN NOW Their watches, and the rest securely sleep. END
BEGIN NOW The night, proceeding on with silent pace, END
BEGIN NOW Stood in her noon, and view'd with equal face END
BEGIN NOW Her steepy rise and her declining race. END
BEGIN NOW Then wakeful Palinurus rose, to spy END
BEGIN NOW The face of heav'n, and the nocturnal sky; END
BEGIN NOW And listen'd ev'ry breath of air to try; END
BEGIN NOW Observes the stars, and notes their sliding course, END
BEGIN NOW The Pleiads, Hyads, and their wat'ry force; END
BEGIN NOW And both the Bears is careful to behold, END
BEGIN NOW And bright Orion, arm'd with burnish'd gold. END
BEGIN NOW Then, when he saw no threat'ning tempest nigh, END
BEGIN NOW But a sure promise of a settled sky, END
BEGIN NOW He gave the sign to weigh; we break our sleep, END
BEGIN NOW Forsake the pleasing shore, and plow the deep. END
BEGIN NOW And now the rising morn with rosy light END
BEGIN NOW Adorns the skies, and puts the stars to flight; END
BEGIN NOW When we from far, like bluish mists, descry END
BEGIN NOW The hills, and then the plains, of Italy. END
BEGIN NOW Achates first pronounc'd the joyful sound; END
BEGIN NOW Then, 'Italy!' the cheerful crew rebound. END
BEGIN NOW My sire Anchises crown'd a cup with wine, END
BEGIN NOW And, off'ring, thus implor'd the pow'rs divine: END
BEGIN NOW 'Ye gods, presiding over lands and seas, END
BEGIN NOW And you who raging winds and waves appease, END
BEGIN NOW Breathe on our swelling sails a prosp'rous wind, END
BEGIN NOW And smooth our passage to the port assign'd!' END
BEGIN NOW The gentle gales their flagging force renew, END
BEGIN NOW And now the happy harbor is in view. END
BEGIN NOW Minerva's temple then salutes our sight, END
BEGIN NOW Plac'd, as a landmark, on the mountain's height. END
BEGIN NOW We furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore; END
BEGIN NOW The curling waters round the galleys roar. END
BEGIN NOW The land lies open to the raging east, END
BEGIN NOW Then, bending like a bow, with rocks compress'd, END
BEGIN NOW Shuts out the storms; the winds and waves complain, END
BEGIN NOW And vent their malice on the cliffs in vain. END
BEGIN NOW The port lies hid within; on either side END
BEGIN NOW Two tow'ring rocks the narrow mouth divide. END
BEGIN NOW The temple, which aloft we view'd before, END
BEGIN NOW To distance flies, and seems to shun the shore. END
BEGIN NOW Scarce landed, the first omens I beheld END
BEGIN NOW Were four white steeds that cropp'd the flow'ry field. END
BEGIN NOW 'War, war is threaten'd from this foreign ground,' END
BEGIN NOW My father cried, 'where warlike steeds are found. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, since reclaim'd to chariots they submit, END
BEGIN NOW And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit, END
BEGIN NOW Peace may succeed to war.' Our way we bend END
BEGIN NOW To Pallas, and the sacred hill ascend; END
BEGIN NOW There prostrate to the fierce virago pray, END
BEGIN NOW Whose temple was the landmark of our way. END
BEGIN NOW Each with a Phrygian mantle veil'd his head, END
BEGIN NOW And all commands of Helenus obey'd, END
BEGIN NOW And pious rites to Grecian Juno paid. END
BEGIN NOW These dues perform'd, we stretch our sails, and stand END
BEGIN NOW To sea, forsaking that suspected land. END
BEGIN NOW From hence Tarentum's bay appears in view, END
BEGIN NOW For Hercules renown'd, if fame be true. END
BEGIN NOW Just opposite, Lacinian Juno stands; END
BEGIN NOW Caulonian tow'rs, and Scylacaean strands, END
BEGIN NOW For shipwrecks fear'd. Mount Aetna thence we spy, END
BEGIN NOW Known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky. END
BEGIN NOW Far off we hear the waves with surly sound END
BEGIN NOW Invade the rocks, the rocks their groans rebound. END
BEGIN NOW The billows break upon the sounding strand, END
BEGIN NOW And roll the rising tide, impure with sand. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus Anchises, in experience old: END
BEGIN NOW ''T is that Charybdis which the seer foretold, END
BEGIN NOW And those the promis'd rocks! Bear off to sea!' END
BEGIN NOW With haste the frighted mariners obey. END
BEGIN NOW First Palinurus to the larboard veer'd; END
BEGIN NOW Then all the fleet by his example steer'd. END
BEGIN NOW To heav'n aloft on ridgy waves we ride, END
BEGIN NOW Then down to hell descend, when they divide; END
BEGIN NOW And thrice our galleys knock'd the stony ground, END
BEGIN NOW And thrice the hollow rocks return'd the sound, END
BEGIN NOW And thrice we saw the stars, that stood with dews around. END
BEGIN NOW The flagging winds forsook us, with the sun; END
BEGIN NOW And, wearied, on Cyclopian shores we run. END
BEGIN NOW The port capacious, and secure from wind, END
BEGIN NOW Is to the foot of thund'ring Aetna join'd. END
BEGIN NOW By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high; END
BEGIN NOW By turns hot embers from her entrails fly, END
BEGIN NOW And flakes of mounting flames, that lick the sky. END
BEGIN NOW Oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown, END
BEGIN NOW And, shiver'd by the force, come piecemeal down. END
BEGIN NOW Oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow, END
BEGIN NOW Fed from the fiery springs that boil below. END
BEGIN NOW Enceladus, they say, transfix'd by Jove, END
BEGIN NOW With blasted limbs came tumbling from above; END
BEGIN NOW And, where he fell, th' avenging father drew END
BEGIN NOW This flaming hill, and on his body threw. END
BEGIN NOW As often as he turns his weary sides, END
BEGIN NOW He shakes the solid isle, and smoke the heavens hides. END
BEGIN NOW In shady woods we pass the tedious night, END
BEGIN NOW Where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright, END
BEGIN NOW Of which no cause is offer'd to the sight; END
BEGIN NOW For not one star was kindled in the sky, END
BEGIN NOW Nor could the moon her borrow'd light supply; END
BEGIN NOW For misty clouds involv'd the firmament, END
BEGIN NOW The stars were muffled, and the moon was pent. END
BEGIN NOW Scarce had the rising sun the day reveal'd, END
BEGIN NOW Scarce had his heat the pearly dews dispell'd, END
BEGIN NOW When from the woods there bolts, before our sight, END
BEGIN NOW Somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite, END
BEGIN NOW So thin, so ghastly meager, and so wan, END
BEGIN NOW So bare of flesh, he scarce resembled man. END
BEGIN NOW This thing, all tatter'd, seem'd from far t' implore END
BEGIN NOW Our pious aid, and pointed to the shore. END
BEGIN NOW We look behind, then view his shaggy beard; END
BEGIN NOW His clothes were tagg'd with thorns, and filth his limbs END
BEGIN NOW besmear'd; END
BEGIN NOW The rest, in mien, in habit, and in face, END
BEGIN NOW Appear'd a Greek, and such indeed he was. END
BEGIN NOW He cast on us, from far, a frightful view, END
BEGIN NOW Whom soon for Trojans and for foes he knew; END
BEGIN NOW Stood still, and paus'd; then all at once began END
BEGIN NOW To stretch his limbs, and trembled as he ran. END
BEGIN NOW Soon as approach'd, upon his knees he falls, END
BEGIN NOW And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls: END
BEGIN NOW 'Now, by the pow'rs above, and what we share END
BEGIN NOW From Nature's common gift, this vital air, END
BEGIN NOW O Trojans, take me hence! I beg no more; END
BEGIN NOW But bear me far from this unhappy shore. END
BEGIN NOW 'T is true, I am a Greek, and farther own, END
BEGIN NOW Among your foes besieg'd th' imperial town. END
BEGIN NOW For such demerits if my death be due, END
BEGIN NOW No more for this abandon'd life I sue; END
BEGIN NOW This only favor let my tears obtain, END
BEGIN NOW To throw me headlong in the rapid main: END
BEGIN NOW Since nothing more than death my crime demands, END
BEGIN NOW I die content, to die by human hands.' END
BEGIN NOW He said, and on his knees my knees embrac'd: END
BEGIN NOW I bade him boldly tell his fortune past, END
BEGIN NOW His present state, his lineage, and his name, END
BEGIN NOW Th' occasion of his fears, and whence he came. END
BEGIN NOW The good Anchises rais'd him with his hand; END
BEGIN NOW Who, thus encourag'd, answer'd our demand: END
BEGIN NOW 'From Ithaca, my native soil, I came END
BEGIN NOW To Troy; and Achaemenides my name. END
BEGIN NOW Me my poor father with Ulysses sent; END
BEGIN NOW (O had I stay'd, with poverty content!) END
BEGIN NOW But, fearful for themselves, my countrymen END
BEGIN NOW Left me forsaken in the Cyclops' den. END
BEGIN NOW The cave, tho' large, was dark; the dismal floor END
BEGIN NOW Was pav'd with mangled limbs and putrid gore. END
BEGIN NOW Our monstrous host, of more than human size, END
BEGIN NOW Erects his head, and stares within the skies; END
BEGIN NOW Bellowing his voice, and horrid is his hue. END
BEGIN NOW Ye gods, remove this plague from mortal view! END
BEGIN NOW The joints of slaughter'd wretches are his food; END
BEGIN NOW And for his wine he quaffs the streaming blood. END
BEGIN NOW These eyes beheld, when with his spacious hand END
BEGIN NOW He seiz'd two captives of our Grecian band; END
BEGIN NOW Stretch'd on his back, he dash'd against the stones END
BEGIN NOW Their broken bodies, and their crackling bones: END
BEGIN NOW With spouting blood the purple pavement swims, END
BEGIN NOW While the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs. END
BEGIN NOW 'Not unreveng'd Ulysses bore their fate, END
BEGIN NOW Nor thoughtless of his own unhappy state; END
BEGIN NOW For, gorg'd with flesh, and drunk with human wine END
BEGIN NOW While fast asleep the giant lay supine, END
BEGIN NOW Snoring aloud, and belching from his maw END
BEGIN NOW His indigested foam, and morsels raw; END
BEGIN NOW We pray; we cast the lots, and then surround END
BEGIN NOW The monstrous body, stretch'd along the ground: END
BEGIN NOW Each, as he could approach him, lends a hand END
BEGIN NOW To bore his eyeball with a flaming brand. END
BEGIN NOW Beneath his frowning forehead lay his eye; END
BEGIN NOW For only one did the vast frame supply- END
BEGIN NOW But that a globe so large, his front it fill'd, END
BEGIN NOW Like the sun's disk or like a Grecian shield. END
BEGIN NOW The stroke succeeds; and down the pupil bends: END
BEGIN NOW This vengeance follow'd for our slaughter'd friends. END
BEGIN NOW But haste, unhappy wretches, haste to fly! END
BEGIN NOW Your cables cut, and on your oars rely! END
BEGIN NOW Such, and so vast as Polypheme appears, END
BEGIN NOW A hundred more this hated island bears: END
BEGIN NOW Like him, in caves they shut their woolly sheep; END
BEGIN NOW Like him, their herds on tops of mountains keep; END
BEGIN NOW Like him, with mighty strides, they stalk from steep to steep END
BEGIN NOW And now three moons their sharpen'd horns renew, END
BEGIN NOW Since thus, in woods and wilds, obscure from view, END
BEGIN NOW I drag my loathsome days with mortal fright, END
BEGIN NOW And in deserted caverns lodge by night; END
BEGIN NOW Oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see END
BEGIN NOW Of the huge Cyclops, like a walking tree: END
BEGIN NOW From far I hear his thund'ring voice resound, END
BEGIN NOW And trampling feet that shake the solid ground. END
BEGIN NOW Cornels and salvage berries of the wood, END
BEGIN NOW And roots and herbs, have been my meager food. END
BEGIN NOW While all around my longing eyes I cast, END
BEGIN NOW I saw your happy ships appear at last. END
BEGIN NOW On those I fix'd my hopes, to these I run; END
BEGIN NOW 'T is all I ask, this cruel race to shun; END
BEGIN NOW What other death you please, yourselves bestow.' END
BEGIN NOW Scarce had he said, when on the mountain's brow END
BEGIN NOW We saw the giant shepherd stalk before END
BEGIN NOW His following flock, and leading to the shore: END
BEGIN NOW A monstrous bulk, deform'd, depriv'd of sight; END
BEGIN NOW His staff a trunk of pine, to guide his steps aright. END
BEGIN NOW His pond'rous whistle from his neck descends; END
BEGIN NOW His woolly care their pensive lord attends: END
BEGIN NOW This only solace his hard fortune sends. END
BEGIN NOW Soon as he reach'd the shore and touch'd the waves, END
BEGIN NOW From his bor'd eye the gutt'ring blood he laves: END
BEGIN NOW He gnash'd his teeth, and groan'd; thro' seas he strides, END
BEGIN NOW And scarce the topmost billows touch'd his sides. END
BEGIN NOW Seiz'd with a sudden fear, we run to sea, END
BEGIN NOW The cables cut, and silent haste away; END
BEGIN NOW The well-deserving stranger entertain; END
BEGIN NOW Then, buckling to the work, our oars divide the main. END
BEGIN NOW The giant harken'd to the dashing sound: END
BEGIN NOW But, when our vessels out of reach he found, END
BEGIN NOW He strided onward, and in vain essay'd END
BEGIN NOW Th' Ionian deep, and durst no farther wade. END
BEGIN NOW With that he roar'd aloud: the dreadful cry END
BEGIN NOW Shakes earth, and air, and seas; the billows fly END
BEGIN NOW Before the bellowing noise to distant Italy. END
BEGIN NOW The neigh'ring Aetna trembling all around, END
BEGIN NOW The winding caverns echo to the sound. END
BEGIN NOW His brother Cyclops hear the yelling roar, END
BEGIN NOW And, rushing down the mountains, crowd the shore. END
BEGIN NOW We saw their stern distorted looks, from far, END
BEGIN NOW And one-eyed glance, that vainly threaten'd war: END
BEGIN NOW A dreadful council, with their heads on high; END
BEGIN NOW (The misty clouds about their foreheads fly;) END
BEGIN NOW Not yielding to the tow'ring tree of Jove, END
BEGIN NOW Or tallest cypress of Diana's grove. END
BEGIN NOW New pangs of mortal fear our minds assail; END
BEGIN NOW We tug at ev'ry oar, and hoist up ev'ry sail, END
BEGIN NOW And take th' advantage of the friendly gale. END
BEGIN NOW Forewarn'd by Helenus, we strive to shun END
BEGIN NOW Charybdis' gulf, nor dare to Scylla run. END
BEGIN NOW An equal fate on either side appears: END
BEGIN NOW We, tacking to the left, are free from fears; END
BEGIN NOW For, from Pelorus' point, the North arose, END
BEGIN NOW And drove us back where swift Pantagias flows. END
BEGIN NOW His rocky mouth we pass, and make our way END
BEGIN NOW By Thapsus and Megara's winding bay. END
BEGIN NOW This passage Achaemenides had shown, END
BEGIN NOW Tracing the course which he before had run. END
BEGIN NOW Right o'er against Plemmyrium's wat'ry strand, END
BEGIN NOW There lies an isle once call'd th' Ortygian land. END
BEGIN NOW Alpheus, as old fame reports, has found END
BEGIN NOW From Greece a secret passage under ground, END
BEGIN NOW By love to beauteous Arethusa led; END
BEGIN NOW And, mingling here, they roll in the same sacred bed. END
BEGIN NOW As Helenus enjoin'd, we next adore END
BEGIN NOW Diana's name, protectress of the shore. END
BEGIN NOW With prosp'rous gales we pass the quiet sounds END
BEGIN NOW Of still Elorus, and his fruitful bounds. END
BEGIN NOW Then, doubling Cape Pachynus, we survey END
BEGIN NOW The rocky shore extended to the sea. END
BEGIN NOW The town of Camarine from far we see, END
BEGIN NOW And fenny lake, undrain'd by fate's decree. END
BEGIN NOW In sight of the Geloan fields we pass, END
BEGIN NOW And the large walls, where mighty Gela was; END
BEGIN NOW Then Agragas, with lofty summits crown'd, END
BEGIN NOW Long for the race of warlike steeds renown'd. END
BEGIN NOW We pass'd Selinus, and the palmy land, END
BEGIN NOW And widely shun the Lilybaean strand, END
BEGIN NOW Unsafe, for secret rocks and moving sand. END
BEGIN NOW At length on shore the weary fleet arriv'd, END
BEGIN NOW Which Drepanum's unhappy port receiv'd. END
BEGIN NOW Here, after endless labors, often toss'd END
BEGIN NOW By raging storms, and driv'n on ev'ry coast, END
BEGIN NOW My dear, dear father, spent with age, I lost: END
BEGIN NOW Ease of my cares, and solace of my pain, END
BEGIN NOW Sav'd thro' a thousand toils, but sav'd in vain END
BEGIN NOW The prophet, who my future woes reveal'd, END
BEGIN NOW Yet this, the greatest and the worst, conceal'd; END
BEGIN NOW And dire Celaeno, whose foreboding skill END
BEGIN NOW Denounc'd all else, was silent of the ill. END
BEGIN NOW This my last labor was. Some friendly god END
BEGIN NOW From thence convey'd us to your blest abode. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, to the list'ning queen, the royal guest END
BEGIN NOW His wand'ring course and all his toils express'd; END
BEGIN NOW And here concluding, he retir'd to rest. END
BEGIN NOW But anxious cares already seiz'd the queen: END
BEGIN NOW She fed within her veins a flame unseen; END
BEGIN NOW The hero's valor, acts, and birth inspire END
BEGIN NOW Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire. END
BEGIN NOW His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart, END
BEGIN NOW Improve the passion, and increase the smart. END
BEGIN NOW Now, when the purple morn had chas'd away END
BEGIN NOW The dewy shadows, and restor'd the day, END
BEGIN NOW Her sister first with early care she sought, END
BEGIN NOW And thus in mournful accents eas'd her thought: END
BEGIN NOW My dearest Anna, what new dreams affright END
BEGIN NOW My lab'ring soul! what visions of the night END
BEGIN NOW Disturb my quiet, and distract my breast END
BEGIN NOW With strange ideas of our Trojan guest! END
BEGIN NOW His worth, his actions, and majestic air, END
BEGIN NOW A man descended from the gods declare. END
BEGIN NOW Fear ever argues a degenerate kind; END
BEGIN NOW His birth is well asserted by his mind. END
BEGIN NOW Then, what he suffer'd, when by Fate betray'd! END
BEGIN NOW What brave attempts for falling Troy he made! END
BEGIN NOW Such were his looks, so gracefully he spoke, END
BEGIN NOW That, were I not resolv'd against the yoke END
BEGIN NOW Of hapless marriage, never to be curst END
BEGIN NOW With second love, so fatal was my first, END
BEGIN NOW To this one error I might yield again; END
BEGIN NOW For, since Sichaeus was untimely slain, END
BEGIN NOW This only man is able to subvert END
BEGIN NOW The fix'd foundations of my stubborn heart. END
BEGIN NOW And, to confess my frailty, to my shame, END
BEGIN NOW Somewhat I find within, if not the same, END
BEGIN NOW Too like the sparkles of my former flame. END
BEGIN NOW But first let yawning earth a passage rend, END
BEGIN NOW And let me thro' the dark abyss descend; END
BEGIN NOW First let avenging Jove, with flames from high, END
BEGIN NOW Drive down this body to the nether sky, END
BEGIN NOW Condemn'd with ghosts in endless night to lie, END
BEGIN NOW Before I break the plighted faith I gave! END
BEGIN NOW No! he who had my vows shall ever have; END
BEGIN NOW For, whom I lov'd on earth, I worship in the grave. END
BEGIN NOW She said: the tears ran gushing from her eyes, END
BEGIN NOW And stopp'd her speech. Her sister thus replies: END
BEGIN NOW O dearer than the vital air I breathe, END
BEGIN NOW Will you to grief your blooming years bequeath, END
BEGIN NOW Condemn'd to waste in woes your lonely life, END
BEGIN NOW Without the joys of mother or of wife? END
BEGIN NOW Think you these tears, this pompous train of woe, END
BEGIN NOW Are known or valued by the ghosts below? END
BEGIN NOW I grant that, while your sorrows yet were green, END
BEGIN NOW It well became a woman, and a queen, END
BEGIN NOW The vows of Tyrian princes to neglect, END
BEGIN NOW To scorn Hyarbas, and his love reject, END
BEGIN NOW With all the Libyan lords of mighty name; END
BEGIN NOW But will you fight against a pleasing flame! END
BEGIN NOW This little spot of land, which Heav'n bestows, END
BEGIN NOW On ev'ry side is hemm'd with warlike foes; END
BEGIN NOW Gaetulian cities here are spread around, END
BEGIN NOW And fierce Numidians there your frontiers bound; END
BEGIN NOW Here lies a barren waste of thirsty land, END
BEGIN NOW And there the Syrtes raise the moving sand; END
BEGIN NOW Barcaean troops besiege the narrow shore, END
BEGIN NOW And from the sea Pygmalion threatens more. END
BEGIN NOW Propitious Heav'n, and gracious Juno, lead END
BEGIN NOW This wand'ring navy to your needful aid: END
BEGIN NOW How will your empire spread, your city rise, END
BEGIN NOW From such a union, and with such allies? END
BEGIN NOW Implore the favor of the pow'rs above, END
BEGIN NOW And leave the conduct of the rest to love. END
BEGIN NOW Continue still your hospitable way, END
BEGIN NOW And still invent occasions of their stay, END
BEGIN NOW Till storms and winter winds shall cease to threat, END
BEGIN NOW And planks and oars repair their shatter'd fleet. END
BEGIN NOW These words, which from a friend and sister came, END
BEGIN NOW With ease resolv'd the scruples of her fame, END
BEGIN NOW And added fury to the kindled flame. END
BEGIN NOW Inspir'd with hope, the project they pursue; END
BEGIN NOW On ev'ry altar sacrifice renew: END
BEGIN NOW A chosen ewe of two years old they pay END
BEGIN NOW Preferring Juno's pow'r, for Juno ties END
BEGIN NOW The nuptial knot and makes the marriage joys. END
BEGIN NOW The beauteous queen before her altar stands, END
BEGIN NOW And holds the golden goblet in her hands. END
BEGIN NOW A milk-white heifer she with flow'rs adorns, END
BEGIN NOW And pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns; END
BEGIN NOW And, while the priests with pray'r the gods invoke, END
BEGIN NOW She feeds their altars with Sabaean smoke, END
BEGIN NOW With hourly care the sacrifice renews, END
BEGIN NOW And anxiously the panting entrails views. END
BEGIN NOW What priestly rites, alas! what pious art, END
BEGIN NOW What vows avail to cure a bleeding heart! END
BEGIN NOW A gentle fire she feeds within her veins, END
BEGIN NOW Where the soft god secure in silence reigns. END
BEGIN NOW Sick with desire, and seeking him she loves, END
BEGIN NOW From street to street the raving Dido roves. END
BEGIN NOW So when the watchful shepherd, from the blind, END
BEGIN NOW Wounds with a random shaft the careless hind, END
BEGIN NOW Distracted with her pain she flies the woods, END
BEGIN NOW Bounds o'er the lawn, and seeks the silent floods, END
BEGIN NOW With fruitless care; for still the fatal dart END
BEGIN NOW Sticks in her side, and rankles in her heart. END
BEGIN NOW And now she leads the Trojan chief along END
BEGIN NOW The lofty walls, amidst the busy throng; END
BEGIN NOW Displays her Tyrian wealth, and rising town, END
BEGIN NOW Which love, without his labor, makes his own. END
BEGIN NOW This pomp she shows, to tempt her wand'ring guest; END
BEGIN NOW Her falt'ring tongue forbids to speak the rest. END
BEGIN NOW When day declines, and feasts renew the night, END
BEGIN NOW Still on his face she feeds her famish'd sight; END
BEGIN NOW She longs again to hear the prince relate END
BEGIN NOW His own adventures and the Trojan fate. END
BEGIN NOW He tells it o'er and o'er; but still in vain, END
BEGIN NOW For still she begs to hear it once again. END
BEGIN NOW The hearer on the speaker's mouth depends, END
BEGIN NOW And thus the tragic story never ends. END
BEGIN NOW Then, when they part, when Phoebe's paler light END
BEGIN NOW Withdraws, and falling stars to sleep invite, END
BEGIN NOW She last remains, when ev'ry guest is gone, END
BEGIN NOW Sits on the bed he press'd, and sighs alone; END
BEGIN NOW Absent, her absent hero sees and hears; END
BEGIN NOW Or in her bosom young Ascanius bears, END
BEGIN NOW And seeks the father's image in the child, END
BEGIN NOW If love by likeness might be so beguil'd. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime the rising tow'rs are at a stand; END
BEGIN NOW No labors exercise the youthful band, END
BEGIN NOW Nor use of arts, nor toils of arms they know; END
BEGIN NOW The mole is left unfinish'd to the foe; END
BEGIN NOW The mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie, END
BEGIN NOW Short of their promis'd heighth, that seem'd to threat the sky, END
BEGIN NOW But when imperial Juno, from above, END
BEGIN NOW Saw Dido fetter'd in the chains of love, END
BEGIN NOW Hot with the venom which her veins inflam'd, END
BEGIN NOW And by no sense of shame to be reclaim'd, END
BEGIN NOW With soothing words to Venus she begun: END
BEGIN NOW High praises, endless honors, you have won, END
BEGIN NOW And mighty trophies, with your worthy son! END
BEGIN NOW Two gods a silly woman have undone! END
BEGIN NOW Nor am I ignorant, you both suspect END
BEGIN NOW This rising city, which my hands erect: END
BEGIN NOW But shall celestial discord never cease? END
BEGIN NOW 'T is better ended in a lasting peace. END
BEGIN NOW You stand possess'd of all your soul desir'd: END
BEGIN NOW Poor Dido with consuming love is fir'd. END
BEGIN NOW Your Trojan with my Tyrian let us join; END
BEGIN NOW So Dido shall be yours, Aeneas mine: END
BEGIN NOW One common kingdom, one united line. END
BEGIN NOW Eliza shall a Dardan lord obey, END
BEGIN NOW And lofty Carthage for a dow'r convey. END
BEGIN NOW Then Venus, who her hidden fraud descried, END
BEGIN NOW Which would the scepter of the world misguide END
BEGIN NOW To Libyan shores, thus artfully replied: END
BEGIN NOW Who, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose, END
BEGIN NOW And such alliance and such gifts refuse, END
BEGIN NOW If Fortune with our joint desires comply? END
BEGIN NOW The doubt is all from Jove and destiny; END
BEGIN NOW Lest he forbid, with absolute command, END
BEGIN NOW To mix the people in one common land- END
BEGIN NOW Or will the Trojan and the Tyrian line END
BEGIN NOW In lasting leagues and sure succession join? END
BEGIN NOW But you, the partner of his bed and throne, END
BEGIN NOW May move his mind; my wishes are your own. END
BEGIN NOW Mine, said imperial Juno, "be the care; END
BEGIN NOW Time urges, now, to perfect this affair: END
BEGIN NOW Attend my counsel, and the secret share. END
BEGIN NOW When next the Sun his rising light displays, END
BEGIN NOW And gilds the world below with purple rays, END
BEGIN NOW The queen, Aeneas, and the Tyrian court END
BEGIN NOW Shall to the shady woods, for sylvan game, resort. END
BEGIN NOW There, while the huntsmen pitch their toils around, END
BEGIN NOW And cheerful horns from side to side resound, END
BEGIN NOW A pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain END
BEGIN NOW With hail, and thunder, and tempestuous rain; END
BEGIN NOW The fearful train shall take their speedy flight, END
BEGIN NOW Dispers'd, and all involv'd in gloomy night; END
BEGIN NOW One cave a grateful shelter shall afford END
BEGIN NOW To the fair princess and the Trojan lord. END
BEGIN NOW I will myself the bridal bed prepare, END
BEGIN NOW If you, to bless the nuptials, will be there: END
BEGIN NOW So shall their loves be crown'd with due delights, END
BEGIN NOW And Hymen shall be present at the rites. END
BEGIN NOW The Queen of Love consents, and closely smiles END
BEGIN NOW At her vain project, and discover'd wiles. END
BEGIN NOW The rosy morn was risen from the main, END
BEGIN NOW And horns and hounds awake the princely train: END
BEGIN NOW They issue early thro' the city gate, END
BEGIN NOW Where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait, END
BEGIN NOW With nets, and toils, and darts, beside the force END
BEGIN NOW Of Spartan dogs, and swift Massylian horse. END
BEGIN NOW The Tyrian peers and officers of state END
BEGIN NOW For the slow queen in antechambers wait; END
BEGIN NOW Her lofty courser, in the court below, END
BEGIN NOW Who his majestic rider seems to know, END
BEGIN NOW Proud of his purple trappings, paws the ground, END
BEGIN NOW And champs the golden bit, and spreads the foam around. END
BEGIN NOW The queen at length appears; on either hand END
BEGIN NOW The brawny guards in martial order stand. END
BEGIN NOW A flow'r'd simar with golden fringe she wore, END
BEGIN NOW And at her back a golden quiver bore; END
BEGIN NOW Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains, END
BEGIN NOW A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains. END
BEGIN NOW Then young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace, END
BEGIN NOW Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase. END
BEGIN NOW But far above the rest in beauty shines END
BEGIN NOW The great Aeneas, the troop he joins; END
BEGIN NOW Like fair Apollo, when he leaves the frost END
BEGIN NOW Of wint'ry Xanthus, and the Lycian coast, END
BEGIN NOW When to his native Delos he resorts, END
BEGIN NOW Ordains the dances, and renews the sports; END
BEGIN NOW Where painted Scythians, mix'd with Cretan bands, END
BEGIN NOW Before the joyful altars join their hands: END
BEGIN NOW Himself, on Cynthus walking, sees below END
BEGIN NOW The merry madness of the sacred show. END
BEGIN NOW Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose; END
BEGIN NOW A golden fillet binds his awful brows; END
BEGIN NOW His quiver sounds: not less the prince is seen END
BEGIN NOW In manly presence, or in lofty mien. END
BEGIN NOW Now had they reach'd the hills, and storm'd the seat END
BEGIN NOW Of salvage beasts, in dens, their last retreat. END
BEGIN NOW The cry pursues the mountain goats: they bound END
BEGIN NOW From rock to rock, and keep the craggy ground; END
BEGIN NOW Quite otherwise the stags, a trembling train, END
BEGIN NOW In herds unsingled, scour the dusty plain, END
BEGIN NOW And a long chase in open view maintain. END
BEGIN NOW The glad Ascanius, as his courser guides, END
BEGIN NOW Spurs thro' the vale, and these and those outrides. END
BEGIN NOW His horse's flanks and sides are forc'd to feel END
BEGIN NOW The clanking lash, and goring of the steel. END
BEGIN NOW Impatiently he views the feeble prey, END
BEGIN NOW Wishing some nobler beast to cross his way, END
BEGIN NOW And rather would the tusky boar attend, END
BEGIN NOW Or see the tawny lion downward bend. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime, the gath'ring clouds obscure the skies: END
BEGIN NOW From pole to pole the forky lightning flies; END
BEGIN NOW The rattling thunders roll; and Juno pours END
BEGIN NOW A wintry deluge down, and sounding show'rs. END
BEGIN NOW The company, dispers'd, to converts ride, END
BEGIN NOW And seek the homely cots, or mountain's hollow side. END
BEGIN NOW The rapid rains, descending from the hills, END
BEGIN NOW To rolling torrents raise the creeping rills. END
BEGIN NOW The queen and prince, as love or fortune guides, END
BEGIN NOW One common cavern in her bosom hides. END
BEGIN NOW Then first the trembling earth the signal gave, END
BEGIN NOW And flashing fires enlighten all the cave; END
BEGIN NOW Hell from below, and Juno from above, END
BEGIN NOW And howling nymphs, were conscious of their love. END
BEGIN NOW From this ill-omen'd hour in time arose END
BEGIN NOW Debate and death, and all succeeding woes. END
BEGIN NOW The queen, whom sense of honor could not move, END
BEGIN NOW No longer made a secret of her love, END
BEGIN NOW But call'd it marriage, by that specious name END
BEGIN NOW To veil the crime and sanctify the shame. END
BEGIN NOW The loud report thro' Libyan cities goes. END
BEGIN NOW Fame, the great ill, from small beginnings grows: END
BEGIN NOW Swift from the first; and ev'ry moment brings END
BEGIN NOW New vigor to her flights, new pinions to her wings. END
BEGIN NOW Soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size; END
BEGIN NOW Her feet on earth, her forehead in the skies. END
BEGIN NOW Inrag'd against the gods, revengeful Earth END
BEGIN NOW Produc'd her last of the Titanian birth. END
BEGIN NOW Swift is her walk, more swift her winged haste: END
BEGIN NOW A monstrous phantom, horrible and vast. END
BEGIN NOW As many plumes as raise her lofty flight, END
BEGIN NOW So many piercing eyes inlarge her sight; END
BEGIN NOW Millions of opening mouths to Fame belong, END
BEGIN NOW And ev'ry mouth is furnish'd with a tongue, END
BEGIN NOW And round with list'ning ears the flying plague is hung. END
BEGIN NOW She fills the peaceful universe with cries; END
BEGIN NOW No slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes; END
BEGIN NOW By day, from lofty tow'rs her head she shews, END
BEGIN NOW And spreads thro' trembling crowds disastrous news; END
BEGIN NOW With court informers haunts, and royal spies; END
BEGIN NOW Talk is her business, and her chief delight END
BEGIN NOW To tell of prodigies and cause affright. END
BEGIN NOW She fills the people's ears with Dido's name, END
BEGIN NOW Who, lost to honor and the sense of shame, END
BEGIN NOW Admits into her throne and nuptial bed END
BEGIN NOW A wand'ring guest, who from his country fled: END
BEGIN NOW Whole days with him she passes in delights, END
BEGIN NOW And wastes in luxury long winter nights, END
BEGIN NOW Forgetful of her fame and royal trust, END
BEGIN NOW Dissolv'd in ease, abandon'd to her lust. END
BEGIN NOW The goddess widely spreads the loud report, END
BEGIN NOW And flies at length to King Hyarba's court. END
BEGIN NOW When first possess'd with this unwelcome news END
BEGIN NOW Whom did he not of men and gods accuse? END
BEGIN NOW This prince, from ravish'd Garamantis born, END
BEGIN NOW A hundred temples did with spoils adorn, END
BEGIN NOW In Ammon's honor, his celestial sire; END
BEGIN NOW A hundred altars fed with wakeful fire; END
BEGIN NOW And, thro' his vast dominions, priests ordain'd, END
BEGIN NOW Whose watchful care these holy rites maintain'd. END
BEGIN NOW The gates and columns were with garlands crown'd, END
BEGIN NOW And blood of victim beasts enrich'd the ground. END
BEGIN NOW He, when he heard a fugitive could move END
BEGIN NOW The Tyrian princess, who disdain'd his love, END
BEGIN NOW His breast with fury burn'd, his eyes with fire, END
BEGIN NOW Mad with despair, impatient with desire; END
BEGIN NOW Then on the sacred altars pouring wine, END
BEGIN NOW He thus with pray'rs implor'd his sire divine: END
BEGIN NOW Great Jove! propitious to the Moorish race, END
BEGIN NOW Who feast on painted beds, with off'rings grace END
BEGIN NOW Thy temples, and adore thy pow'r divine END
BEGIN NOW With blood of victims, and with sparkling wine, END
BEGIN NOW Seest thou not this? or do we fear in vain END
BEGIN NOW Thy boasted thunder, and thy thoughtless reign? END
BEGIN NOW Do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance? END
BEGIN NOW Thine are the bolts, or the blind work of chance? END
BEGIN NOW A wand'ring woman builds, within our state, END
BEGIN NOW A little town, bought at an easy rate; END
BEGIN NOW She pays me homage, and my grants allow END
BEGIN NOW A narrow space of Libyan lands to plow; END
BEGIN NOW Yet, scorning me, by passion blindly led, END
BEGIN NOW Admits a banish'd Trojan to her bed! END
BEGIN NOW And now this other Paris, with his train END
BEGIN NOW Of conquer'd cowards, must in Afric reign! END
BEGIN NOW (Whom, what they are, their looks and garb confess, END
BEGIN NOW Their locks with oil perfum'd, their Lydian dress.) END
BEGIN NOW He takes the spoil, enjoys the princely dame; END
BEGIN NOW And I, rejected I, adore an empty name. END
BEGIN NOW His vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferr'd, END
BEGIN NOW And held his altar's horns. The mighty Thund'rer heard; END
BEGIN NOW Then cast his eyes on Carthage, where he found END
BEGIN NOW The lustful pair in lawless pleasure drown'd, END
BEGIN NOW Lost in their loves, insensible of shame, END
BEGIN NOW And both forgetful of their better fame. END
BEGIN NOW He calls Cyllenius, and the god attends, END
BEGIN NOW By whom his menacing command he sends: END
BEGIN NOW Go, mount the western winds, and cleave the sky; END
BEGIN NOW Then, with a swift descent, to Carthage fly: END
BEGIN NOW There find the Trojan chief, who wastes his days END
BEGIN NOW In slothful not and inglorious ease, END
BEGIN NOW Nor minds the future city, giv'n by fate. END
BEGIN NOW To him this message from my mouth relate: END
BEGIN NOW 'Not so fair Venus hop'd, when twice she won END
BEGIN NOW Thy life with pray'rs, nor promis'd such a son. END
BEGIN NOW Hers was a hero, destin'd to command END
BEGIN NOW A martial race, and rule the Latian land, END
BEGIN NOW Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw, END
BEGIN NOW And on the conquer'd world impose the law.' END
BEGIN NOW If glory cannot move a mind so mean, END
BEGIN NOW Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean, END
BEGIN NOW Yet why should he defraud his son of fame, END
BEGIN NOW And grudge the Romans their immortal name! END
BEGIN NOW What are his vain designs! what hopes he more END
BEGIN NOW From his long ling'ring on a hostile shore, END
BEGIN NOW Regardless to redeem his honor lost, END
BEGIN NOW And for his race to gain th' Ausonian coast! END
BEGIN NOW Bid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake; END
BEGIN NOW With this command the slumb'ring warrior wake. END
BEGIN NOW Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds END
BEGIN NOW His flying feet, and mounts the western winds: END
BEGIN NOW And, whether o'er the seas or earth he flies, END
BEGIN NOW With rapid force they bear him down the skies. END
BEGIN NOW But first he grasps within his awful hand END
BEGIN NOW The mark of sov'reign pow'r, his magic wand; END
BEGIN NOW With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves; END
BEGIN NOW With this he drives them down the Stygian waves; END
BEGIN NOW With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight, END
BEGIN NOW And eyes, tho' clos'd in death, restores to light. END
BEGIN NOW Thus arm'd, the god begins his airy race, END
BEGIN NOW And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space; END
BEGIN NOW Now sees the tops of Atlas, as he flies, END
BEGIN NOW Whose brawny back supports the starry skies; END
BEGIN NOW Atlas, whose head, with piny forests crown'd, END
BEGIN NOW Is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapors bound. END
BEGIN NOW Snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin END
BEGIN NOW The founts of rolling streams their race begin; END
BEGIN NOW A beard of ice on his large breast depends. END
BEGIN NOW Here, pois'd upon his wings, the god descends: END
BEGIN NOW Then, rested thus, he from the tow'ring height END
BEGIN NOW Plung'd downward, with precipitated flight, END
BEGIN NOW Lights on the seas, and skims along the flood. END
BEGIN NOW As waterfowl, who seek their fishy food, END
BEGIN NOW Less, and yet less, to distant prospect show; END
BEGIN NOW By turns they dance aloft, and dive below: END
BEGIN NOW Like these, the steerage of his wings he plies, END
BEGIN NOW And near the surface of the water flies, END
BEGIN NOW Till, having pass'd the seas, and cross'd the sands, END
BEGIN NOW He clos'd his wings, and stoop'd on Libyan lands: END
BEGIN NOW Where shepherds once were hous'd in homely sheds, END
BEGIN NOW Now tow'rs within the clouds advance their heads. END
BEGIN NOW Arriving there, he found the Trojan prince END
BEGIN NOW New ramparts raising for the town's defense. END
BEGIN NOW A purple scarf, with gold embroider'd o'er, END
BEGIN NOW (Queen Dido's gift,) about his waist he wore; END
BEGIN NOW A sword, with glitt'ring gems diversified, END
BEGIN NOW For ornament, not use, hung idly by his side. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus, with winged words, the god began, END
BEGIN NOW Resuming his own shape: "Degenerate man, END
BEGIN NOW Thou woman's property, what mak'st thou here, END
BEGIN NOW These foreign walls and Tyrian tow'rs to rear, END
BEGIN NOW Forgetful of thy own? All-pow'rful Jove, END
BEGIN NOW Who sways the world below and heav'n above, END
BEGIN NOW Has sent me down with this severe command: END
BEGIN NOW What means thy ling'ring in the Libyan land? END

BEGIN NOW The promis'd crown let young Ascanius wear, END
BEGIN NOW To whom th' Ausonian scepter, and the state END
BEGIN NOW Of Rome's imperial name is ow'd by fate. END
BEGIN NOW So spoke the god; and, speaking, took his flight, END
BEGIN NOW Involv'd in clouds, and vanish'd out of sight. END
BEGIN NOW The pious prince was seiz'd with sudden fear; END
BEGIN NOW Mute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair. END
BEGIN NOW Revolving in his mind the stern command, END
BEGIN NOW He longs to fly, and loathes the charming land. END
BEGIN NOW What should he say? or how should he begin? END
BEGIN NOW What course, alas! remains to steer between END
BEGIN NOW Th' offended lover and the pow'rful queen? END
BEGIN NOW This way and that he turns his anxious mind, END
BEGIN NOW And all expedients tries, and none can find. END
BEGIN NOW Fix'd on the deed, but doubtful of the means, END
BEGIN NOW After long thought, to this advice he leans: END
BEGIN NOW Three chiefs he calls, commands them to repair END
BEGIN NOW The fleet, and ship their men with silent care; END
BEGIN NOW Some plausible pretense he bids them find, END
BEGIN NOW To color what in secret he design'd. END
BEGIN NOW Himself, meantime, the softest hours would choose, END
BEGIN NOW Before the love-sick lady heard the news; END
BEGIN NOW And move her tender mind, by slow degrees, END
BEGIN NOW To suffer what the sov'reign pow'r decrees: END
BEGIN NOW Jove will inspire him, when, and what to say. END
BEGIN NOW They hear with pleasure, and with haste obey. END
BEGIN NOW But soon the queen perceives the thin disguise: END
BEGIN NOW (What arts can blind a jealous woman's eyes!) END
BEGIN NOW She was the first to find the secret fraud, END
BEGIN NOW Before the fatal news was blaz'd abroad. END
BEGIN NOW Love the first motions of the lover hears, END
BEGIN NOW Quick to presage, and ev'n in safety fears. END
BEGIN NOW Nor impious Fame was wanting to report END
BEGIN NOW The ships repair'd, the Trojans' thick resort, END
BEGIN NOW And purpose to forsake the Tyrian court. END
BEGIN NOW Frantic with fear, impatient of the wound, END
BEGIN NOW And impotent of mind, she roves the city round. END
BEGIN NOW Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear, END
BEGIN NOW When, from afar, their nightly god they hear, END
BEGIN NOW And howl about the hills, and shake the wreathy spear. END
BEGIN NOW At length she finds the dear perfidious man; END
BEGIN NOW Prevents his form'd excuse, and thus began: END
BEGIN NOW Base and ungrateful! could you hope to fly, END
BEGIN NOW And undiscover'd scape a lover's eye? END
BEGIN NOW Nor could my kindness your compassion move. END
BEGIN NOW Nor plighted vows, nor dearer bands of love? END
BEGIN NOW Or is the death of a despairing queen END
BEGIN NOW Not worth preventing, tho' too well foreseen? END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n when the wintry winds command your stay, END
BEGIN NOW You dare the tempests, and defy the sea. END
BEGIN NOW False as you are, suppose you were not bound END
BEGIN NOW To lands unknown, and foreign coasts to sound; END
BEGIN NOW Were Troy restor'd, and Priam's happy reign, END
BEGIN NOW Now durst you tempt, for Troy, the raging main? END
BEGIN NOW See whom you fly! am I the foe you shun? END
BEGIN NOW Now, by those holy vows, so late begun, END
BEGIN NOW By this right hand, (since I have nothing more END
BEGIN NOW To challenge, but the faith you gave before;) END
BEGIN NOW I beg you by these tears too truly shed, END
BEGIN NOW By the new pleasures of our nuptial bed; END
BEGIN NOW If ever Dido, when you most were kind, END
BEGIN NOW Were pleasing in your eyes, or touch'd your mind; END
BEGIN NOW By these my pray'rs, if pray'rs may yet have place, END
BEGIN NOW Pity the fortunes of a falling race. END
BEGIN NOW For you I have provok'd a tyrant's hate, END
BEGIN NOW Incens'd the Libyan and the Tyrian state; END
BEGIN NOW For you alone I suffer in my fame, END
BEGIN NOW Bereft of honor, and expos'd to shame. END
BEGIN NOW Whom have I now to trust, ungrateful guest? END
BEGIN NOW (That only name remains of all the rest!) END
BEGIN NOW What have I left? or whither can I fly? END
BEGIN NOW Must I attend Pygmalion's cruelty, END
BEGIN NOW Or till Hyarba shall in triumph lead END
BEGIN NOW A queen that proudly scorn'd his proffer'd bed? END
BEGIN NOW Had you deferr'd, at least, your hasty flight, END
BEGIN NOW And left behind some pledge of our delight, END
BEGIN NOW Some babe to bless the mother's mournful sight, END
BEGIN NOW Some young Aeneas, to supply your place, END
BEGIN NOW Whose features might express his father's face; END
BEGIN NOW I should not then complain to live bereft END
BEGIN NOW Of all my husband, or be wholly left. END
BEGIN NOW Here paus'd the queen. Unmov'd he holds his eyes, END
BEGIN NOW By Jove's command; nor suffer'd love to rise, END
BEGIN NOW Tho' heaving in his heart; and thus at length replies: END
BEGIN NOW Fair queen, you never can enough repeat END
BEGIN NOW Your boundless favors, or I own my debt; END
BEGIN NOW Nor can my mind forget Eliza's name, END
BEGIN NOW While vital breath inspires this mortal frame. END
BEGIN NOW This only let me speak in my defense: END
BEGIN NOW I never hop'd a secret flight from hence, END
BEGIN NOW Much less pretended to the lawful claim END
BEGIN NOW Of sacred nuptials, or a husband's name. END
BEGIN NOW For, if indulgent Heav'n would leave me free, END
BEGIN NOW And not submit my life to fate's decree, END
BEGIN NOW My choice would lead me to the Trojan shore, END
BEGIN NOW Those relics to review, their dust adore, END
BEGIN NOW And Priam's ruin'd palace to restore. END
BEGIN NOW But now the Delphian oracle commands, END
BEGIN NOW And fate invites me to the Latian lands. END
BEGIN NOW That is the promis'd place to which I steer, END
BEGIN NOW And all my vows are terminated there. END
BEGIN NOW If you, a Tyrian, and a stranger born, END
BEGIN NOW With walls and tow'rs a Libyan town adorn, END
BEGIN NOW Why may not we- like you, a foreign race- END
BEGIN NOW Like you, seek shelter in a foreign place? END
BEGIN NOW As often as the night obscures the skies END
BEGIN NOW With humid shades, or twinkling stars arise, END
BEGIN NOW Anchises' angry ghost in dreams appears, END
BEGIN NOW Chides my delay, and fills my soul with fears; END
BEGIN NOW And young Ascanius justly may complain END
BEGIN NOW Of his defrauded and destin'd reign. END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n now the herald of the gods appear'd: END
BEGIN NOW Waking I saw him, and his message heard. END
BEGIN NOW From Jove he came commission'd, heav'nly bright END
BEGIN NOW With radiant beams, and manifest to sight END
BEGIN NOW (The sender and the sent I both attest) END
BEGIN NOW These walls he enter'd, and those words express'd. END
BEGIN NOW Fair queen, oppose not what the gods command; END
BEGIN NOW Forc'd by my fate, I leave your happy land. END
BEGIN NOW Thus while he spoke, already she began, END
BEGIN NOW With sparkling eyes, to view the guilty man; END
BEGIN NOW From head to foot survey'd his person o'er, END
BEGIN NOW Nor longer these outrageous threats forebore: END
BEGIN NOW False as thou art, and, more than false, forsworn! END
BEGIN NOW Not sprung from noble blood, nor goddess-born, END
BEGIN NOW But hewn from harden'd entrails of a rock! END
BEGIN NOW And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck! END
BEGIN NOW Why should I fawn? what have I worse to fear? END
BEGIN NOW Did he once look, or lent a list'ning ear, END
BEGIN NOW Sigh'd when I sobb'd, or shed one kindly tear?- END
BEGIN NOW All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind, END
BEGIN NOW So foul, that, which is worse, 'tis hard to find. END
BEGIN NOW Of man's injustice why should I complain? END
BEGIN NOW The gods, and Jove himself, behold in vain END
BEGIN NOW Triumphant treason; yet no thunder flies, END
BEGIN NOW Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes; END
BEGIN NOW Faithless is earth, and faithless are the skies! END
BEGIN NOW Justice is fled, and Truth is now no more! END
BEGIN NOW I sav'd the shipwrack'd exile on my shore; END
BEGIN NOW With needful food his hungry Trojans fed; END
BEGIN NOW I took the traitor to my throne and bed: END
BEGIN NOW Fool that I was- 't is little to repeat END
BEGIN NOW The rest- I stor'd and rigg'd his ruin'd fleet. END
BEGIN NOW I rave, I rave! A god's command he pleads, END
BEGIN NOW And makes Heav'n accessary to his deeds. END
BEGIN NOW Now Lycian lots, and now the Delian god, END
BEGIN NOW Now Hermes is employ'd from Jove's abode, END
BEGIN NOW To warn him hence; as if the peaceful state END
BEGIN NOW Of heav'nly pow'rs were touch'd with human fate! END
BEGIN NOW But go! thy flight no longer I detain- END
BEGIN NOW Go seek thy promis'd kingdom thro' the main! END
BEGIN NOW Yet, if the heav'ns will hear my pious vow, END
BEGIN NOW The faithless waves, not half so false as thou, END
BEGIN NOW Or secret sands, shall sepulchers afford END
BEGIN NOW To thy proud vessels, and their perjur'd lord. END
BEGIN NOW Then shalt thou call on injur'd Dido's name: END
BEGIN NOW Dido shall come in a black sulph'ry flame, END
BEGIN NOW When death has once dissolv'd her mortal frame; END
BEGIN NOW Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep: END
BEGIN NOW Her angry ghost, arising from the deep, END
BEGIN NOW Shall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep. END
BEGIN NOW At least my shade thy punishment shall know, END
BEGIN NOW And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below. END
BEGIN NOW Abruptly here she stops; then turns away END
BEGIN NOW Her loathing eyes, and shuns the sight of day. END
BEGIN NOW Amaz'd he stood, revolving in his mind END
BEGIN NOW What speech to frame, and what excuse to find. END
BEGIN NOW Her fearful maids their fainting mistress led, END
BEGIN NOW And softly laid her on her ivory bed. END
BEGIN NOW But good Aeneas, tho' he much desir'd END
BEGIN NOW To give that pity which her grief requir'd; END
BEGIN NOW Tho' much he mourn'd, and labor'd with his love, END
BEGIN NOW Resolv'd at length, obeys the will of Jove; END
BEGIN NOW Reviews his forces: they with early care END
BEGIN NOW Unmoor their vessels, and for sea prepare. END
BEGIN NOW The fleet is soon afloat, in all its pride, END
BEGIN NOW And well-calk'd galleys in the harbor ride. END
BEGIN NOW Then oaks for oars they fell'd; or, as they stood, END
BEGIN NOW Of its green arms despoil'd the growing wood, END
BEGIN NOW Studious of flight. The beach is cover'd o'er END
BEGIN NOW With Trojan bands, that blacken all the shore: END
BEGIN NOW On ev'ry side are seen, descending down, END
BEGIN NOW Thick swarms of soldiers, loaden from the town. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, in battalia, march embodied ants, END
BEGIN NOW Fearful of winter, and of future wants, END
BEGIN NOW T' invade the corn, and to their cells convey END
BEGIN NOW The plunder'd forage of their yellow prey. END
BEGIN NOW The sable troops, along the narrow tracks, END
BEGIN NOW Scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs: END
BEGIN NOW Some set their shoulders to the pond'rous grain; END
BEGIN NOW Some guard the spoil; some lash the lagging train; END
BEGIN NOW All ply their sev'ral tasks, and equal toil sustain. END
BEGIN NOW What pangs the tender breast of Dido tore, END
BEGIN NOW When, from the tow'r, she saw the cover'd shore, END
BEGIN NOW And heard the shouts of sailors from afar, END
BEGIN NOW Mix'd with the murmurs of the wat'ry war! END
BEGIN NOW All-pow'rful Love! what changes canst thou cause END
BEGIN NOW In human hearts, subjected to thy laws! END
BEGIN NOW Once more her haughty soul the tyrant bends: END
BEGIN NOW To pray'rs and mean submissions she descends. END
BEGIN NOW No female arts or aids she left untried, END
BEGIN NOW Nor counsels unexplor'd, before she died. END
BEGIN NOW Look, Anna! look! the Trojans crowd to sea; END
BEGIN NOW They spread their canvas, and their anchors weigh. END
BEGIN NOW The shouting crew their ships with garlands bind, END
BEGIN NOW Invoke the sea gods, and invite the wind. END
BEGIN NOW Could I have thought this threat'ning blow so near, END
BEGIN NOW My tender soul had been forewarn'd to bear. END
BEGIN NOW But do not you my last request deny; END
BEGIN NOW With yon perfidious man your int'rest try, END
BEGIN NOW And bring me news, if I must live or die. END
BEGIN NOW You are his fav'rite; you alone can find END
BEGIN NOW The dark recesses of his inmost mind: END
BEGIN NOW In all his trusted secrets you have part, END
BEGIN NOW And know the soft approaches to his heart. END
BEGIN NOW Haste then, and humbly seek my haughty foe; END
BEGIN NOW Tell him, I did not with the Grecians go, END
BEGIN NOW Nor did my fleet against his friends employ, END
BEGIN NOW Nor swore the ruin of unhappy Troy, END
BEGIN NOW Nor mov'd with hands profane his father's dust: END
BEGIN NOW Why should he then reject a just! END
BEGIN NOW Whom does he shun, and whither would he fly! END
BEGIN NOW Can he this last, this only pray'r deny! END
BEGIN NOW Let him at least his dang'rous flight delay, END
BEGIN NOW Wait better winds, and hope a calmer sea. END
BEGIN NOW The nuptials he disclaims I urge no more: END
BEGIN NOW Let him pursue the promis'd Latian shore. END
BEGIN NOW A short delay is all I ask him now; END
BEGIN NOW A pause of grief, an interval from woe, END
BEGIN NOW Till my soft soul be temper'd to sustain END
BEGIN NOW Accustom'd sorrows, and inur'd to pain. END
BEGIN NOW If you in pity grant this one request, END
BEGIN NOW My death shall glut the hatred of his breast. END
BEGIN NOW This mournful message pious Anna bears, END
BEGIN NOW And seconds with her own her sister's tears: END
BEGIN NOW But all her arts are still employ'd in vain; END
BEGIN NOW Again she comes, and is refus'd again. END
BEGIN NOW His harden'd heart nor pray'rs nor threat'nings move; END
BEGIN NOW Fate, and the god, had stopp'd his ears to love. END
BEGIN NOW As, when the winds their airy quarrel try, END
BEGIN NOW Justling from ev'ry quarter of the sky, END
BEGIN NOW This way and that the mountain oak they bend, END
BEGIN NOW His boughs they shatter, and his branches rend; END
BEGIN NOW With leaves and falling mast they spread the ground; END
BEGIN NOW The hollow valleys echo to the sound: END
BEGIN NOW Unmov'd, the royal plant their fury mocks, END
BEGIN NOW Or, shaken, clings more closely to the rocks; END
BEGIN NOW Far as he shoots his tow'ring head on high, END
BEGIN NOW So deep in earth his fix'd foundations lie. END
BEGIN NOW No less a storm the Trojan hero bears; END
BEGIN NOW Thick messages and loud complaints he hears, END
BEGIN NOW And bandied words, still beating on his ears. END
BEGIN NOW Sighs, groans, and tears proclaim his inward pains; END
BEGIN NOW But the firm purpose of his heart remains. END
BEGIN NOW The wretched queen, pursued by cruel fate, END
BEGIN NOW Begins at length the light of heav'n to hate, END
BEGIN NOW And loathes to live. Then dire portents she sees, END
BEGIN NOW To hasten on the death her soul decrees: END
BEGIN NOW Strange to relate! for when, before the shrine, END
BEGIN NOW She pours in sacrifice the purple wine, END
BEGIN NOW The purple wine is turn'd to putrid blood, END
BEGIN NOW And the white offer'd milk converts to mud. END
BEGIN NOW This dire presage, to her alone reveal'd, END
BEGIN NOW From all, and ev'n her sister, she conceal'd. END
BEGIN NOW A marble temple stood within the grove, END
BEGIN NOW Sacred to death, and to her murther'd love; END
BEGIN NOW That honor'd chapel she had hung around END
BEGIN NOW With snowy fleeces, and with garlands crown'd: END
BEGIN NOW Oft, when she visited this lonely dome, END
BEGIN NOW Strange voices issued from her husband's tomb; END
BEGIN NOW She thought she heard him summon her away, END
BEGIN NOW Invite her to his grave, and chide her stay. END
BEGIN NOW Hourly 't is heard, when with a boding note END
BEGIN NOW The solitary screech owl strains her throat, END
BEGIN NOW And, on a chimney's top, or turret's height, END
BEGIN NOW With songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, old prophecies augment her fears; END
BEGIN NOW And stern Aeneas in her dreams appears, END
BEGIN NOW Disdainful as by day: she seems, alone, END
BEGIN NOW To wander in her sleep, thro' ways unknown, END
BEGIN NOW Guideless and dark; or, in a desart plain, END
BEGIN NOW To seek her subjects, and to seek in vain: END
BEGIN NOW Like Pentheus, when, distracted with his fear, END
BEGIN NOW He saw two suns, and double Thebes, appear; END
BEGIN NOW Or mad Orestes, when his mother's ghost END
BEGIN NOW Full in his face infernal torches toss'd, END
BEGIN NOW And shook her snaky locks: he shuns the sight, END
BEGIN NOW Flies o'er the stage, surpris'd with mortal fright; END
BEGIN NOW The Furies guard the door and intercept his flight. END
BEGIN NOW Now, sinking underneath a load of grief, END
BEGIN NOW From death alone she seeks her last relief; END
BEGIN NOW The time and means resolv'd within her breast, END
BEGIN NOW She to her mournful sister thus address'd END
BEGIN NOW (Dissembling hope, her cloudy front she clears, END
BEGIN NOW And a false vigor in her eyes appears): END
BEGIN NOW Rejoice! she said. "Instructed from above, END
BEGIN NOW My lover I shall gain, or lose my love. END
BEGIN NOW Nigh rising Atlas, next the falling sun, END
BEGIN NOW Long tracts of Ethiopian climates run: END
BEGIN NOW There a Massylian priestess I have found, END
BEGIN NOW Honor'd for age, for magic arts renown'd: END
BEGIN NOW Th' Hesperian temple was her trusted care; END
BEGIN NOW 'T was she supplied the wakeful dragon's fare. END
BEGIN NOW She poppy seeds in honey taught to steep, END
BEGIN NOW Reclaim'd his rage, and sooth'd him into sleep. END
BEGIN NOW She watch'd the golden fruit; her charms unbind END
BEGIN NOW The chains of love, or fix them on the mind: END
BEGIN NOW She stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry, END
BEGIN NOW Repels the stars, and backward bears the sky. END
BEGIN NOW The yawning earth rebellows to her call, END
BEGIN NOW Pale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall. END
BEGIN NOW Witness, ye gods, and thou my better part, END
BEGIN NOW How loth I am to try this impious art! END
BEGIN NOW Within the secret court, with silent care, END
BEGIN NOW Erect a lofty pile, expos'd in air: END
BEGIN NOW Hang on the topmost part the Trojan vest, END
BEGIN NOW Spoils, arms, and presents, of my faithless guest. END
BEGIN NOW Next, under these, the bridal bed be plac'd, END
BEGIN NOW Where I my ruin in his arms embrac'd: END
BEGIN NOW All relics of the wretch are doom'd to fire; END
BEGIN NOW For so the priestess and her charms require. END
BEGIN NOW Thus far she said, and farther speech forbears; END
BEGIN NOW A mortal paleness in her face appears: END
BEGIN NOW Yet the mistrustless Anna could not find END
BEGIN NOW The secret fun'ral in these rites design'd; END
BEGIN NOW Nor thought so dire a rage possess'd her mind. END
BEGIN NOW Unknowing of a train conceal'd so well, END
BEGIN NOW She fear'd no worse than when Sichaeus fell; END
BEGIN NOW Therefore obeys. The fatal pile they rear, END
BEGIN NOW Within the secret court, expos'd in air. END
BEGIN NOW The cloven holms and pines are heap'd on high, END
BEGIN NOW And garlands on the hollow spaces lie. END
BEGIN NOW Sad cypress, vervain, yew, compose the wreath, END
BEGIN NOW And ev'ry baleful green denoting death. END
BEGIN NOW The queen, determin'd to the fatal deed, END
BEGIN NOW The spoils and sword he left, in order spread, END
BEGIN NOW And the man's image on the nuptial bed. END
BEGIN NOW And now (the sacred altars plac'd around) END
BEGIN NOW The priestess enters, with her hair unbound, END
BEGIN NOW And thrice invokes the pow'rs below the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Night, Erebus, and Chaos she proclaims, END
BEGIN NOW And threefold Hecate, with her hundred names, END
BEGIN NOW And three Dianas: next, she sprinkles round END
BEGIN NOW With feign'd Avernian drops the hallow'd ground; END
BEGIN NOW Culls hoary simples, found by Phoebe's light, END
BEGIN NOW With brazen sickles reap'd at noon of night; END
BEGIN NOW Then mixes baleful juices in the bowl, END
BEGIN NOW And cuts the forehead of a newborn foal, END
BEGIN NOW Robbing the mother's love. The destin'd queen END
BEGIN NOW Observes, assisting at the rites obscene; END
BEGIN NOW A leaven'd cake in her devoted hands END
BEGIN NOW She holds, and next the highest altar stands: END
BEGIN NOW One tender foot was shod, her other bare; END
BEGIN NOW Girt was her gather'd gown, and loose her hair. END
BEGIN NOW Thus dress'd, she summon'd, with her dying breath, END
BEGIN NOW The heav'ns and planets conscious of her death, END
BEGIN NOW And ev'ry pow'r, if any rules above, END
BEGIN NOW Who minds, or who revenges, injur'd love. END
BEGIN NOW 'T was dead of night, when weary bodies close END
BEGIN NOW Their eyes in balmy sleep and soft repose: END
BEGIN NOW The winds no longer whisper thro' the woods, END
BEGIN NOW Nor murm'ring tides disturb the gentle floods. END
BEGIN NOW The stars in silent order mov'd around; END
BEGIN NOW And Peace, with downy wings, was brooding on the ground END
BEGIN NOW The flocks and herds, and party-color'd fowl, END
BEGIN NOW Which haunt the woods, or swim the weedy pool, END
BEGIN NOW Stretch'd on the quiet earth, securely lay, END
BEGIN NOW Forgetting the past labors of the day. END
BEGIN NOW All else of nature's common gift partake: END
BEGIN NOW Unhappy Dido was alone awake. END
BEGIN NOW Nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find; END
BEGIN NOW Sleep fled her eyes, as quiet fled her mind. END
BEGIN NOW Despair, and rage, and love divide her heart; END
BEGIN NOW Despair and rage had some, but love the greater part. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus she said within her secret mind: END
BEGIN NOW What shall I do? what succor can I find? END
BEGIN NOW Become a suppliant to Hyarba's pride, END
BEGIN NOW And take my turn, to court and be denied? END
BEGIN NOW Shall I with this ungrateful Trojan go, END
BEGIN NOW Forsake an empire, and attend a foe? END
BEGIN NOW Himself I refug'd, and his train reliev'd- END
BEGIN NOW 'T is true- but am I sure to be receiv'd? END
BEGIN NOW Can gratitude in Trojan souls have place! END
BEGIN NOW Laomedon still lives in all his race! END
BEGIN NOW Then, shall I seek alone the churlish crew, END
BEGIN NOW Or with my fleet their flying sails pursue? END
BEGIN NOW What force have I but those whom scarce before END
BEGIN NOW I drew reluctant from their native shore? END
BEGIN NOW Will they again embark at my desire, END
BEGIN NOW Once more sustain the seas, and quit their second Tyre? END
BEGIN NOW Rather with steel thy guilty breast invade, END
BEGIN NOW And take the fortune thou thyself hast made. END
BEGIN NOW Your pity, sister, first seduc'd my mind, END
BEGIN NOW Or seconded too well what I design'd. END
BEGIN NOW These dear-bought pleasures had I never known, END
BEGIN NOW Had I continued free, and still my own; END
BEGIN NOW Avoiding love, I had not found despair, END
BEGIN NOW But shar'd with salvage beasts the common air. END
BEGIN NOW Like them, a lonely life I might have led, END
BEGIN NOW Not mourn'd the living, nor disturb'd the dead. END
BEGIN NOW These thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast. END
BEGIN NOW On board, the Trojan found more easy rest. END
BEGIN NOW Resolv'd to sail, in sleep he pass'd the night; END
BEGIN NOW And order'd all things for his early flight. END
BEGIN NOW To whom once more the winged god appears; END
BEGIN NOW His former youthful mien and shape he wears, END
BEGIN NOW And with this new alarm invades his ears: END
BEGIN NOW Sleep'st thou, O goddess-born! and canst thou drown END
BEGIN NOW Thy needful cares, so near a hostile town, END
BEGIN NOW Beset with foes; nor hear'st the western gales END
BEGIN NOW Invite thy passage, and inspire thy sails? END
BEGIN NOW She harbors in her heart a furious hate, END
BEGIN NOW And thou shalt find the dire effects too late; END
BEGIN NOW Fix'd on revenge, and obstinate to die. END
BEGIN NOW Haste swiftly hence, while thou hast pow'r to fly. END
BEGIN NOW The sea with ships will soon be cover'd o'er, END
BEGIN NOW And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore. END
BEGIN NOW Prevent her rage, while night obscures the skies, END
BEGIN NOW And sail before the purple morn arise. END
BEGIN NOW Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring? END
BEGIN NOW Woman's a various and a changeful thing. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Hermes in the dream; then took his flight END
BEGIN NOW Aloft in air unseen, and mix'd with night. END
BEGIN NOW Twice warn'd by the celestial messenger, END
BEGIN NOW The pious prince arose with hasty fear; END
BEGIN NOW Then rous'd his drowsy train without delay: END
BEGIN NOW Haste to your banks; your crooked anchors weigh, END
BEGIN NOW And spread your flying sails, and stand to sea. END
BEGIN NOW A god commands: he stood before my sight, END
BEGIN NOW And urg'd us once again to speedy flight. END
BEGIN NOW O sacred pow'r, what pow'r soe'er thou art, END
BEGIN NOW To thy blest orders I resign my heart. END
BEGIN NOW Lead thou the way; protect thy Trojan bands, END
BEGIN NOW And prosper the design thy will commands. END
BEGIN NOW He said: and, drawing forth his flaming sword, END
BEGIN NOW His thund'ring arm divides the many-twisted cord. END
BEGIN NOW An emulating zeal inspires his train: END
BEGIN NOW They run; they snatch; they rush into the main. END
BEGIN NOW With headlong haste they leave the desert shores, END
BEGIN NOW And brush the liquid seas with lab'ring oars. END
BEGIN NOW Aurora now had left her saffron bed, END
BEGIN NOW And beams of early light the heav'ns o'erspread, END
BEGIN NOW When, from a tow'r, the queen, with wakeful eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Saw day point upward from the rosy skies. END
BEGIN NOW She look'd to seaward; but the sea was void, END
BEGIN NOW And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried. END
BEGIN NOW Stung with despite, and furious with despair, END
BEGIN NOW She struck her trembling breast, and tore her hair. END
BEGIN NOW And shall th' ungrateful traitor go," she said, END
BEGIN NOW My land forsaken, and my love betray'd? END
BEGIN NOW Shall we not arm? not rush from ev'ry street, END
BEGIN NOW To follow, sink, and burn his perjur'd fleet? END
BEGIN NOW Haste, haul my galleys out! pursue the foe! END
BEGIN NOW Bring flaming brands! set sail, and swiftly row! END
BEGIN NOW What have I said? where am I? Fury turns END
BEGIN NOW My brain; and my distemper'd bosom burns. END
BEGIN NOW Then, when I gave my person and my throne, END
BEGIN NOW This hate, this rage, had been more timely shown. END
BEGIN NOW See now the promis'd faith, the vaunted name, END
BEGIN NOW The pious man, who, rushing thro' the flame, END
BEGIN NOW Preserv'd his gods, and to the Phrygian shore END
BEGIN NOW The burthen of his feeble father bore! END
BEGIN NOW I should have torn him piecemeal; strow'd in floods END
BEGIN NOW His scatter'd limbs, or left expos'd in woods; END
BEGIN NOW Destroy'd his friends and son; and, from the fire, END
BEGIN NOW Have set the reeking boy before the sire. END
BEGIN NOW Events are doubtful, which on battles wait: END
BEGIN NOW Yet where's the doubt, to souls secure of fate? END
BEGIN NOW My Tyrians, at their injur'd queen's command, END
BEGIN NOW Had toss'd their fires amid the Trojan band; END
BEGIN NOW At once extinguish'd all the faithless name; END
BEGIN NOW And I myself, in vengeance of my shame, END
BEGIN NOW Had fall'n upon the pile, to mend the fun'ral flame. END
BEGIN NOW Thou Sun, who view'st at once the world below; END
BEGIN NOW Thou Juno, guardian of the nuptial vow; END
BEGIN NOW Thou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes! END
BEGIN NOW Ye Furies, fiends, and violated gods, END
BEGIN NOW All pow'rs invok'd with Dido's dying breath, END
BEGIN NOW Attend her curses and avenge her death! END
BEGIN NOW If so the Fates ordain, Jove commands, END
BEGIN NOW Th' ungrateful wretch should find the Latian lands, END
BEGIN NOW Yet let a race untam'd, and haughty foes, END
BEGIN NOW His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose: END
BEGIN NOW Oppress'd with numbers in th' unequal field, END
BEGIN NOW His men discourag'd, and himself expell'd, END
BEGIN NOW Let him for succor sue from place to place, END
BEGIN NOW Torn from his subjects, and his son's embrace. END
BEGIN NOW First, let him see his friends in battle slain, END
BEGIN NOW And their untimely fate lament in vain; END
BEGIN NOW And when, at length, the cruel war shall cease, END
BEGIN NOW On hard conditions may he buy his peace: END
BEGIN NOW Nor let him then enjoy supreme command; END
BEGIN NOW But fall, untimely, by some hostile hand, END
BEGIN NOW And lie unburied on the barren sand! END
BEGIN NOW These are my pray'rs, and this my dying will; END
BEGIN NOW And you, my Tyrians, ev'ry curse fulfil. END
BEGIN NOW Perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim, END
BEGIN NOW Against the prince, the people, and the name. END
BEGIN NOW These grateful off'rings on my grave bestow; END
BEGIN NOW Nor league, nor love, the hostile nations know! END
BEGIN NOW Now, and from hence, in ev'ry future age, END
BEGIN NOW When rage excites your arms, and strength supplies the rage END
BEGIN NOW Rise some avenger of our Libyan blood, END
BEGIN NOW With fire and sword pursue the perjur'd brood; END
BEGIN NOW Our arms, our seas, our shores, oppos'd to theirs; END
BEGIN NOW And the same hate descend on all our heirs! END
BEGIN NOW This said, within her anxious mind she weighs END
BEGIN NOW The means of cutting short her odious days. END
BEGIN NOW Then to Sichaeus' nurse she briefly said END
BEGIN NOW (For, when she left her country, hers was dead): END
BEGIN NOW Go, Barce, call my sister. Let her care END
BEGIN NOW The solemn rites of sacrifice prepare; END
BEGIN NOW The sheep, and all th' atoning off'rings bring, END
BEGIN NOW Sprinkling her body from the crystal spring END
BEGIN NOW With living drops; then let her come, and thou END
BEGIN NOW With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow. END
BEGIN NOW Thus will I pay my vows to Stygian Jove, END
BEGIN NOW And end the cares of my disastrous love; END
BEGIN NOW Then cast the Trojan image on the fire, END
BEGIN NOW And, as that burns, my passions shall expire. END
BEGIN NOW The nurse moves onward, with officious care, END
BEGIN NOW And all the speed her aged limbs can bear. END
BEGIN NOW But furious Dido, with dark thoughts involv'd, END
BEGIN NOW Shook at the mighty mischief she resolv'd. END
BEGIN NOW With livid spots distinguish'd was her face; END
BEGIN NOW Red were her rolling eyes, and discompos'd her pace; END
BEGIN NOW Ghastly she gaz'd, with pain she drew her breath, END
BEGIN NOW And nature shiver'd at approaching death. END
BEGIN NOW Then swiftly to the fatal place she pass'd, END
BEGIN NOW And mounts the fun'ral pile with furious haste; END
BEGIN NOW Unsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind END
BEGIN NOW (Not for so dire an enterprise design'd). END
BEGIN NOW But when she view'd the garments loosely spread, END
BEGIN NOW Which once he wore, and saw the conscious bed, END
BEGIN NOW She paus'd, and with a sigh the robes embrac'd; END
BEGIN NOW Then on the couch her trembling body cast, END
BEGIN NOW Repress'd the ready tears, and spoke her last: END
BEGIN NOW Dear pledges of my love, while Heav'n so pleas'd, END
BEGIN NOW Receive a soul, of mortal anguish eas'd: END
BEGIN NOW My fatal course is finish'd; and I go, END
BEGIN NOW A glorious name, among the ghosts below. END
BEGIN NOW A lofty city by my hands is rais'd, END
BEGIN NOW Pygmalion punish'd, and my lord appeas'd. END
BEGIN NOW What could my fortune have afforded more, END
BEGIN NOW Had the false Trojan never touch'd my shore! END
BEGIN NOW Then kiss'd the couch; and, "Must I die," she said, END
BEGIN NOW And unreveng'd? 'T is doubly to be dead! END
BEGIN NOW Yet ev'n this death with pleasure I receive: END
BEGIN NOW On any terms, 't is better than to live. END
BEGIN NOW These flames, from far, may the false Trojan view; END
BEGIN NOW These boding omens his base flight pursue! END
BEGIN NOW She said, and struck; deep enter'd in her side END
BEGIN NOW The piercing steel, with reeking purple dyed: END
BEGIN NOW Clogg'd in the wound the cruel weapon stands; END
BEGIN NOW The spouting blood came streaming on her hands. END
BEGIN NOW Her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke, END
BEGIN NOW And with loud cries the sounding palace shook. END
BEGIN NOW Distracted, from the fatal sight they fled, END
BEGIN NOW And thro' the town the dismal rumor spread. END
BEGIN NOW First from the frighted court the yell began; END
BEGIN NOW Redoubled, thence from house to house it ran: END
BEGIN NOW The groans of men, with shrieks, laments, and cries END
BEGIN NOW Of mixing women, mount the vaulted skies. END
BEGIN NOW Not less the clamor, than if- ancient Tyre, END
BEGIN NOW Or the new Carthage, set by foes on fire- END
BEGIN NOW The rolling ruin, with their lov'd abodes, END
BEGIN NOW Involv'd the blazing temples of their gods. END
BEGIN NOW Her sister hears; and, furious with despair, END
BEGIN NOW She beats her breast, and rends her yellow hair, END
BEGIN NOW And, calling on Eliza's name aloud, END
BEGIN NOW Runs breathless to the place, and breaks the crowd. END
BEGIN NOW Was all that pomp of woe for this prepar'd; END
BEGIN NOW These fires, this fun'ral pile, these altars rear'd? END
BEGIN NOW Was all this train of plots contriv'd," said she, END
BEGIN NOW All only to deceive unhappy me? END
BEGIN NOW Which is the worst? Didst thou in death pretend END
BEGIN NOW To scorn thy sister, or delude thy friend? END
BEGIN NOW Thy summon'd sister, and thy friend, had come; END
BEGIN NOW One sword had serv'd us both, one common tomb: END
BEGIN NOW Was I to raise the pile, the pow'rs invoke, END
BEGIN NOW Not to be present at the fatal stroke? END
BEGIN NOW At once thou hast destroy'd thyself and me, END
BEGIN NOW Thy town, thy senate, and thy colony! END
BEGIN NOW Bring water; bathe the wound; while I in death END
BEGIN NOW Lay close my lips to hers, and catch the flying breath. END
BEGIN NOW This said, she mounts the pile with eager haste, END
BEGIN NOW And in her arms the gasping queen embrac'd; END
BEGIN NOW Her temples chaf'd; and her own garments tore, END
BEGIN NOW To stanch the streaming blood, and cleanse the gore. END
BEGIN NOW Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head, END
BEGIN NOW And, fainting thrice, fell grov'ling on the bed; END
BEGIN NOW Thrice op'd her heavy eyes, and sought the light, END
BEGIN NOW But, having found it, sicken'd at the sight, END
BEGIN NOW And clos'd her lids at last in endless night. END
BEGIN NOW Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain END
BEGIN NOW A death so ling'ring, and so full of pain, END
BEGIN NOW Sent Iris down, to free her from the strife END
BEGIN NOW Of lab'ring nature, and dissolve her life. END
BEGIN NOW For since she died, not doom'd by Heav'n's decree, END
BEGIN NOW Or her own crime, but human casualty, END
BEGIN NOW And rage of love, that plung'd her in despair, END
BEGIN NOW The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair, END
BEGIN NOW Which Proserpine and they can only know; END
BEGIN NOW Nor made her sacred to the shades below. END
BEGIN NOW Downward the various goddess took her flight, END
BEGIN NOW And drew a thousand colors from the light; END
BEGIN NOW Then stood above the dying lover's head, END
BEGIN NOW And said: "I thus devote thee to the dead. END
BEGIN NOW This off'ring to th' infernal gods I bear. END
BEGIN NOW Thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair: END
BEGIN NOW The struggling soul was loos'd, and life dissolv'd in air. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime the Trojan cuts his wat'ry way, END
BEGIN NOW Fix'd on his voyage, thro' the curling sea; END
BEGIN NOW Then, casting back his eyes, with dire amaze, END
BEGIN NOW Sees on the Punic shore the mounting blaze. END
BEGIN NOW The cause unknown; yet his presaging mind END
BEGIN NOW The fate of Dido from the fire divin'd; END
BEGIN NOW He knew the stormy souls of womankind, END
BEGIN NOW What secret springs their eager passions move, END
BEGIN NOW How capable of death for injur'd love. END
BEGIN NOW Dire auguries from hence the Trojans draw; END
BEGIN NOW Till neither fires nor shining shores they saw. END
BEGIN NOW Now seas and skies their prospect only bound; END
BEGIN NOW An empty space above, a floating field around. END
BEGIN NOW But soon the heav'ns with shadows were o'erspread; END
BEGIN NOW A swelling cloud hung hov'ring o'er their head: END
BEGIN NOW Livid it look'd, the threat'ning of a storm: END
BEGIN NOW Then night and horror ocean's face deform. END
BEGIN NOW The pilot, Palinurus, cried aloud: END
BEGIN NOW What gusts of weather from that gath'ring cloud END
BEGIN NOW My thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars, END
BEGIN NOW Stand to your tackle, mates, and stretch your oars; END
BEGIN NOW Contract your swelling sails, and luff to wind. END
BEGIN NOW The frighted crew perform the task assign'd. END
BEGIN NOW Then, to his fearless chief: "Not Heav'n," said he, END
BEGIN NOW Tho' Jove himself should promise Italy, END
BEGIN NOW Can stem the torrent of this raging sea. END
BEGIN NOW Mark how the shifting winds from west arise, END
BEGIN NOW And what collected night involves the skies! END
BEGIN NOW Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea, END
BEGIN NOW Much less against the tempest force their way. END
BEGIN NOW 'T is fate diverts our course, and fate we must obey. END
BEGIN NOW Not far from hence, if I observ'd aright END
BEGIN NOW The southing of the stars, and polar light, END
BEGIN NOW Sicilia lies, whose hospitable shores END
BEGIN NOW In safety we may reach with struggling oars. END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas then replied: "Too sure I find END
BEGIN NOW We strive in vain against the seas and wind: END
BEGIN NOW Now shift your sails; what place can please me more END
BEGIN NOW Than what you promise, the Sicilian shore, END
BEGIN NOW Whose hallow'd earth Anchises' bones contains, END
BEGIN NOW And where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns? END
BEGIN NOW The course resolv'd, before the western wind END
BEGIN NOW They scud amain, and make the port assign'd. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime Acestes, from a lofty stand, END
BEGIN NOW Beheld the fleet descending on the land; END
BEGIN NOW And, not unmindful of his ancient race, END
BEGIN NOW Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace, END
BEGIN NOW And held the hero in a strict embrace. END
BEGIN NOW Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore, END
BEGIN NOW And either hand a pointed jav'lin bore. END
BEGIN NOW His mother was a dame of Dardan blood; END
BEGIN NOW His sire Crinisus, a Sicilian flood. END
BEGIN NOW He welcomes his returning friends ashore END
BEGIN NOW With plenteous country cates and homely store. END
BEGIN NOW Now, when the following morn had chas'd away END
BEGIN NOW The flying stars, and light restor'd the day, END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas call'd the Trojan troops around, END
BEGIN NOW And thus bespoke them from a rising ground: END
BEGIN NOW Offspring of heav'n, divine Dardanian race! END
BEGIN NOW The sun, revolving thro' th' ethereal space, END
BEGIN NOW The shining circle of the year has fill'd, END
BEGIN NOW Since first this isle my father's ashes held: END
BEGIN NOW And now the rising day renews the year; END
BEGIN NOW A day for ever sad, for ever dear. END
BEGIN NOW This would I celebrate with annual games, END
BEGIN NOW With gifts on altars pil'd, and holy flames, END
BEGIN NOW Tho' banish'd to Gaetulia's barren sands, END
BEGIN NOW Caught on the Grecian seas, or hostile lands: END
BEGIN NOW But since this happy storm our fleet has driv'n END
BEGIN NOW (Not, as I deem, without the will of Heav'n) END
BEGIN NOW Upon these friendly shores and flow'ry plains, END
BEGIN NOW Which hide Anchises and his blest remains, END
BEGIN NOW Let us with joy perform his honors due, END
BEGIN NOW And pray for prosp'rous winds, our voyage to renew; END
BEGIN NOW Pray, that in towns and temples of our own, END
BEGIN NOW The name of great Anchises may be known, END
BEGIN NOW And yearly games may spread the gods' renown. END
BEGIN NOW Our sports Acestes, of the Trojan race, END
BEGIN NOW With royal gifts ordain'd, is pleas'd to grace: END
BEGIN NOW Two steers on ev'ry ship the king bestows; END
BEGIN NOW His gods and ours shall share your equal vows. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, if, nine days hence, the rosy morn END
BEGIN NOW Shall with unclouded light the skies adorn, END
BEGIN NOW That day with solemn sports I mean to grace: END
BEGIN NOW Light galleys on the seas shall run a wat'ry race; END
BEGIN NOW Some shall in swiftness for the goal contend, END
BEGIN NOW And others try the twanging bow to bend; END
BEGIN NOW The strong, with iron gauntlets arm'd, shall stand END
BEGIN NOW Oppos'd in combat on the yellow sand. END
BEGIN NOW Let all be present at the games prepar'd, END
BEGIN NOW And joyful victors wait the just reward. END
BEGIN NOW But now assist the rites, with garlands crown'd. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and first his brows with myrtle bound. END
BEGIN NOW Then Helymus, by his example led, END
BEGIN NOW And old Acestes, each adorn'd his head; END
BEGIN NOW Thus young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace, END
BEGIN NOW His temples tied, and all the Trojan race. END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas then advanc'd amidst the train, END
BEGIN NOW By thousands follow'd thro' the flow'ry plain, END
BEGIN NOW To great Anchises' tomb; which when he found, END
BEGIN NOW He pour'd to Bacchus, on the hallow'd ground, END
BEGIN NOW Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more, END
BEGIN NOW And two (from offer'd bulls) of purple gore, END
BEGIN NOW With roses then the sepulcher he strow'd END
BEGIN NOW And thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud: END
BEGIN NOW Hail, O ye holy manes! hail again, END
BEGIN NOW Paternal ashes, now review'd in vain! END
BEGIN NOW The gods permitted not, that you, with me, END
BEGIN NOW Should reach the promis'd shores of Italy, END
BEGIN NOW Or Tiber's flood, what flood soe'er it be. END
BEGIN NOW Scarce had he finish'd, when, with speckled pride, END
BEGIN NOW A serpent from the tomb began to glide; END
BEGIN NOW His hugy bulk on sev'n high volumes roll'd; END
BEGIN NOW Blue was his breadth of back, but streak'd with scaly gold: END
BEGIN NOW Thus riding on his curls, he seem'd to pass END
BEGIN NOW A rolling fire along, and singe the grass. END
BEGIN NOW More various colors thro' his body run, END
BEGIN NOW Than Iris when her bow imbibes the sun. END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt the rising altars, and around, END
BEGIN NOW The sacred monster shot along the ground; END
BEGIN NOW With harmless play amidst the bowls he pass'd, END
BEGIN NOW And with his lolling tongue assay'd the taste: END
BEGIN NOW Thus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest END
BEGIN NOW Within the hollow tomb retir'd to rest. END
BEGIN NOW The pious prince, surpris'd at what he view'd, END
BEGIN NOW The fun'ral honors with more zeal renew'd, END
BEGIN NOW Doubtful if this place's genius were, END
BEGIN NOW Or guardian of his father's sepulcher. END
BEGIN NOW Five sheep, according to the rites, he slew; END
BEGIN NOW As many swine, and steers of sable hue; END
BEGIN NOW New gen'rous wine he from the goblets pour'd. END
BEGIN NOW And call'd his father's ghost, from hell restor'd. END
BEGIN NOW The glad attendants in long order come, END
BEGIN NOW Off'ring their gifts at great Anchises' tomb: END
BEGIN NOW Some add more oxen: some divide the spoil; END
BEGIN NOW Some place the chargers on the grassy soil; END
BEGIN NOW Some blow the fires, and off entrails broil. END
BEGIN NOW Now came the day desir'd. The skies were bright END
BEGIN NOW With rosy luster of the rising light: END
BEGIN NOW The bord'ring people, rous'd by sounding fame END
BEGIN NOW Of Trojan feasts and great Acestes' name, END
BEGIN NOW The crowded shore with acclamations fill, END
BEGIN NOW Part to behold, and part to prove their skill. END
BEGIN NOW And first the gifts in public view they place, END
BEGIN NOW Green laurel wreaths, and palm, the victors' grace: END
BEGIN NOW Within the circle, arms and tripods lie, END
BEGIN NOW Ingots of gold and silver, heap'd on high, END
BEGIN NOW And vests embroider'd, of the Tyrian dye. END
BEGIN NOW The trumpet's clangor then the feast proclaims, END
BEGIN NOW And all prepare for their appointed games. END
BEGIN NOW Four galleys first, which equal rowers bear, END
BEGIN NOW Advancing, in the wat'ry lists appear. END
BEGIN NOW The speedy Dolphin, that outstrips the wind, END
BEGIN NOW Bore Mnestheus, author of the Memmian kind: END
BEGIN NOW Gyas the vast Chimaera's bulk commands, END
BEGIN NOW Which rising, like a tow'ring city stands; END
BEGIN NOW Three Trojans tug at ev'ry lab'ring oar; END
BEGIN NOW Three banks in three degrees the sailors bore; END
BEGIN NOW Beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar. END
BEGIN NOW Sergesthus, who began the Sergian race, END
BEGIN NOW In the great Centaur took the leading place; END
BEGIN NOW Cloanthus on the sea-green Scylla stood, END
BEGIN NOW From whom Cluentius draws his Trojan blood. END
BEGIN NOW Far in the sea, against the foaming shore, END
BEGIN NOW There stands a rock: the raging billows roar END
BEGIN NOW Above his head in storms; but, when 't is clear, END
BEGIN NOW Uncurl their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear. END
BEGIN NOW In peace below the gentle waters run; END
BEGIN NOW The cormorants above lie basking in the sun. END
BEGIN NOW On this the hero fix'd an oak in sight, END
BEGIN NOW The mark to guide the mariners aright. END
BEGIN NOW To bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars; END
BEGIN NOW Then round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores. END
BEGIN NOW The lots decide their place. Above the rest, END
BEGIN NOW Each leader shining in his Tyrian vest; END
BEGIN NOW The common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs END
BEGIN NOW Their temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows: END
BEGIN NOW Besmear'd with oil, their naked shoulders shine. END
BEGIN NOW All take their seats, and wait the sounding sign: END
BEGIN NOW They gripe their oars; and ev'ry panting breast END
BEGIN NOW Is rais'd by turns with hope, by turns with fear depress'd. END
BEGIN NOW The clangor of the trumpet gives the sign; END
BEGIN NOW At once they start, advancing in a line: END
BEGIN NOW With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies; END
BEGIN NOW Lash'd with their oars, the smoky billows rise; END
BEGIN NOW Sparkles the briny main, and the vex'd ocean fries. END
BEGIN NOW Exact in time, with equal strokes they row: END
BEGIN NOW At once the brushing oars and brazen prow END
BEGIN NOW Dash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below. END
BEGIN NOW Not fiery coursers, in a chariot race, END
BEGIN NOW Invade the field with half so swift a pace; END
BEGIN NOW Not the fierce driver with more fury lends END
BEGIN NOW The sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends, END
BEGIN NOW Low to the wheels his pliant body bends. END
BEGIN NOW The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide, END
BEGIN NOW And aid with eager shouts the favor'd side. END
BEGIN NOW Cries, murmurs, clamors, with a mixing sound, END
BEGIN NOW From woods to woods, from hills to hills rebound. END
BEGIN NOW Amidst the loud applauses of the shore, END
BEGIN NOW Gyas outstripp'd the rest, and sprung before: END
BEGIN NOW Cloanthus, better mann'd, pursued him fast, END
BEGIN NOW But his o'er-masted galley check'd his haste. END
BEGIN NOW The Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine END
BEGIN NOW With equal oars, advancing in a line; END
BEGIN NOW And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead, END
BEGIN NOW And now the speedy Dolphin gets ahead; END
BEGIN NOW Now board to board the rival vessels row, END
BEGIN NOW The billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below. END
BEGIN NOW They reach'd the mark. Proud Gyas and his train END
BEGIN NOW In triumph rode, the victors of the main; END
BEGIN NOW But, steering round, he charg'd his pilot stand END
BEGIN NOW More close to shore, and skim along the sand- END
BEGIN NOW Let others bear to sea!" Menoetes heard; END
BEGIN NOW But secret shelves too cautiously he fear'd, END
BEGIN NOW And, fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he steer'd. END
BEGIN NOW With louder cries the captain call'd again: END
BEGIN NOW Bear to the rocky shore, and shun the main. END
BEGIN NOW He spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw END
BEGIN NOW The bold Cloanthus near the shelvings draw. END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood, END
BEGIN NOW And in a closer compass plow'd the flood. END
BEGIN NOW He pass'd the mark; and, wheeling, got before: END
BEGIN NOW Gyas blasphem'd the gods, devoutly swore, END
BEGIN NOW Cried out for anger, and his hair he tore. END
BEGIN NOW Mindless of others' lives (so high was grown END
BEGIN NOW His rising rage) and careless of his own, END
BEGIN NOW Then hoisted up, and overboard he threw: END
BEGIN NOW This done, he seiz'd the helm; his fellows cheer'd, END
BEGIN NOW Turn'd short upon the shelfs, and madly steer'd. END
BEGIN NOW Hardly his head the plunging pilot rears, END
BEGIN NOW Clogg'd with his clothes, and cumber'd with his years: END
BEGIN NOW Now dropping wet, he climbs the cliff with pain. END
BEGIN NOW The crowd, that saw him fall and float again, END
BEGIN NOW Shout from the distant shore; and loudly laugh'd, END
BEGIN NOW To see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught. END
BEGIN NOW The following Centaur, and the Dolphin's crew, END
BEGIN NOW Their vanish'd hopes of victory renew; END
BEGIN NOW While Gyas lags, they kindle in the race, END
BEGIN NOW To reach the mark. Sergesthus takes the place; END
BEGIN NOW Mnestheus pursues; and while around they wind, END
BEGIN NOW Comes up, not half his galley's length behind; END
BEGIN NOW Then, on the deck, amidst his mates appear'd, END
BEGIN NOW And thus their drooping courage he cheer'd: END
BEGIN NOW My friends, and Hector's followers heretofore, END
BEGIN NOW Exert your vigor; tug the lab'ring oar; END
BEGIN NOW Stretch to your strokes, my still unconquer'd crew, END
BEGIN NOW Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew. END
BEGIN NOW In this, our common int'rest, let me find END
BEGIN NOW That strength of hand, that courage of the mind, END
BEGIN NOW As when you stemm'd the strong Malean flood, END
BEGIN NOW And o'er the Syrtes' broken billows row'd. END
BEGIN NOW I seek not now the foremost palm to gain; END
BEGIN NOW Tho' yet- but, ah! that haughty wish is vain! END
BEGIN NOW Let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain. END
BEGIN NOW But to be last, the lags of all the race!- END
BEGIN NOW Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace. END
BEGIN NOW Now, one and all, they tug amain; they row END
BEGIN NOW At the full stretch, and shake the brazen prow. END
BEGIN NOW The sea beneath 'em sinks; their lab'ring sides END
BEGIN NOW Are swell'd, and sweat runs gutt'ring down in tides. END
BEGIN NOW Chance aids their daring with unhop'd success; END
BEGIN NOW Sergesthus, eager with his beak to press END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt the rival galley and the rock, END
BEGIN NOW Shuts up th' unwieldly Centaur in the lock. END
BEGIN NOW The vessel struck; and, with the dreadful shock, END
BEGIN NOW Her oars she shiver'd, and her head she broke. END
BEGIN NOW The trembling rowers from their banks arise, END
BEGIN NOW And, anxious for themselves, renounce the prize. END
BEGIN NOW With iron poles they heave her off the shores, END
BEGIN NOW And gather from the sea their floating oars. END
BEGIN NOW The crew of Mnestheus, with elated minds, END
BEGIN NOW Urge their success, and call the willing winds; END
BEGIN NOW Then ply their oars, and cut their liquid way END
BEGIN NOW In larger compass on the roomy sea. END
BEGIN NOW As, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes, END
BEGIN NOW Rous'd in a fright, her sounding wings she shakes; END
BEGIN NOW The cavern rings with clatt'ring; out she flies, END
BEGIN NOW And leaves her callow care, and cleaves the skies: END
BEGIN NOW At first she flutters; but at length she springs END
BEGIN NOW To smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings: END
BEGIN NOW So Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts the sea; END
BEGIN NOW And, flying with a force, that force assists his way. END
BEGIN NOW Sergesthus in the Centaur soon he pass'd, END
BEGIN NOW Wedg'd in the rocky shoals, and sticking fast. END
BEGIN NOW In vain the victor he with cries implores, END
BEGIN NOW And practices to row with shatter'd oars. END
BEGIN NOW Then Mnestheus bears with Gyas, and outflies: END
BEGIN NOW The ship, without a pilot, yields the prize. END
BEGIN NOW Unvanquish'd Scylla now alone remains; END
BEGIN NOW Her he pursues, and all his vigor strains. END
BEGIN NOW Shouts from the fav'ring multitude arise; END
BEGIN NOW Applauding Echo to the shouts replies; END
BEGIN NOW Shouts, wishes, and applause run rattling thro' the skies. END
BEGIN NOW These clamors with disdain the Scylla heard, END
BEGIN NOW Much grudg'd the praise, but more the robb'd reward: END
BEGIN NOW Resolv'd to hold their own, they mend their pace, END
BEGIN NOW All obstinate to die, or gain the race. END
BEGIN NOW Rais'd with success, the Dolphin swiftly ran; END
BEGIN NOW For they can conquer, who believe they can. END
BEGIN NOW Both urge their oars, and fortune both supplies, END
BEGIN NOW And both perhaps had shar'd an equal prize; END
BEGIN NOW When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands, END
BEGIN NOW And succor from the wat'ry pow'rs demands: END
BEGIN NOW Gods of the liquid realms, on which I row! END
BEGIN NOW If, giv'n by you, the laurel bind my brow, END
BEGIN NOW Assist to make me guilty of my vow! END
BEGIN NOW A snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain; END
BEGIN NOW His offer'd entrails cast into the main, END
BEGIN NOW And ruddy wine, from golden goblets thrown, END
BEGIN NOW Your grateful gift and my return shall own. END
BEGIN NOW The choir of nymphs, and Phorcus, from below, END
BEGIN NOW With virgin Panopea, heard his vow; END
BEGIN NOW And old Portunus, with his breadth of hand, END
BEGIN NOW Push'd on, and sped the galley to the land. END
BEGIN NOW Swift as a shaft, or winged wind, she flies, END
BEGIN NOW And, darting to the port, obtains the prize. END
BEGIN NOW The herald summons all, and then proclaims END
BEGIN NOW Cloanthus conqu'ror of the naval games. END
BEGIN NOW The prince with laurel crowns the victor's head, END
BEGIN NOW And three fat steers are to his vessel led, END
BEGIN NOW The ship's reward; with gen'rous wine beside, END
BEGIN NOW And sums of silver, which the crew divide. END
BEGIN NOW The leaders are distinguish'd from the rest; END
BEGIN NOW The victor honor'd with a nobler vest, END
BEGIN NOW Where gold and purple strive in equal rows, END
BEGIN NOW And needlework its happy cost bestows. END
BEGIN NOW There Ganymede is wrought with living art, END
BEGIN NOW Chasing thro' Ida's groves the trembling hart: END
BEGIN NOW Breathless he seems, yet eager to pursue; END
BEGIN NOW When from aloft descends, in open view, END
BEGIN NOW The bird of Jove, and, sousing on his prey, END
BEGIN NOW With crooked talons bears the boy away. END
BEGIN NOW In vain, with lifted hands and gazing eyes, END
BEGIN NOW His guards behold him soaring thro' the skies, END
BEGIN NOW And dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries. END
BEGIN NOW Mnestheus the second victor was declar'd; END
BEGIN NOW And, summon'd there, the second prize he shard. END
BEGIN NOW A coat of mail, brave Demoleus bore, END
BEGIN NOW More brave Aeneas from his shoulders tore, END
BEGIN NOW In single combat on the Trojan shore: END
BEGIN NOW This was ordain'd for Mnestheus to possess; END
BEGIN NOW In war for his defense, for ornament in peace. END
BEGIN NOW Rich was the gift, and glorious to behold, END
BEGIN NOW But yet so pond'rous with its plates of gold, END
BEGIN NOW That scarce two servants could the weight sustain; END
BEGIN NOW Yet, loaded thus, Demoleus o'er the plain END
BEGIN NOW Pursued and lightly seiz'd the Trojan train. END
BEGIN NOW The third, succeeding to the last reward, END
BEGIN NOW Two goodly bowls of massy silver shar'd, END
BEGIN NOW With figures prominent, and richly wrought, END
BEGIN NOW And two brass caldrons from Dodona brought. END
BEGIN NOW Thus all, rewarded by the hero's hands, END
BEGIN NOW Their conqu'ring temples bound with purple bands; END
BEGIN NOW And now Sergesthus, clearing from the rock, END
BEGIN NOW Brought back his galley shatter'd with the shock. END
BEGIN NOW Forlorn she look'd, without an aiding oar, END
BEGIN NOW And, houted by the vulgar, made to shore. END
BEGIN NOW As when a snake, surpris'd upon the road, END
BEGIN NOW Is crush'd athwart her body by the load END
BEGIN NOW Of heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound END
BEGIN NOW Her belly bruis'd, and trodden to the ground: END
BEGIN NOW In vain, with loosen'd curls, she crawls along; END
BEGIN NOW Yet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue; END
BEGIN NOW Glares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales; END
BEGIN NOW But, groveling in the dust, her parts unsound she trails: END
BEGIN NOW So slowly to the port the Centaur tends, END
BEGIN NOW But, what she wants in oars, with sails amends. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, for his galley sav'd, the grateful prince END
BEGIN NOW Is pleas'd th' unhappy chief to recompense. END
BEGIN NOW Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care, END
BEGIN NOW Beauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair. END
BEGIN NOW From thence his way the Trojan hero bent END
BEGIN NOW Into the neighb'ring plain, with mountains pent, END
BEGIN NOW Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood. END
BEGIN NOW Full in the midst of this fair valley stood END
BEGIN NOW A native theater, which, rising slow END
BEGIN NOW By just degrees, o'erlook'd the ground below. END
BEGIN NOW High on a sylvan throne the leader sate; END
BEGIN NOW A num'rous train attend in solemn state. END
BEGIN NOW Here those that in the rapid course delight, END
BEGIN NOW Desire of honor and the prize invite. END
BEGIN NOW The rival runners without order stand; END
BEGIN NOW The Trojans mix'd with the Sicilian band. END
BEGIN NOW First Nisus, with Euryalus, appears; END
BEGIN NOW Euryalus a boy of blooming years, END
BEGIN NOW With sprightly grace and equal beauty crown'd; END
BEGIN NOW Nisus, for friendship to the youth renown'd. END
BEGIN NOW Diores next, of Priam's royal race, END
BEGIN NOW Then Salius joined with Patron, took their place; END
BEGIN NOW (But Patron in Arcadia had his birth, END
BEGIN NOW And Salius his from Arcananian earth;) END
BEGIN NOW Then two Sicilian youths- the names of these, END
BEGIN NOW Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes: END
BEGIN NOW Both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred, END
BEGIN NOW And owning old Acestes for their head; END
BEGIN NOW With sev'ral others of ignobler name, END
BEGIN NOW Whom time has not deliver'd o'er to fame. END
BEGIN NOW To these the hero thus his thoughts explain'd, END
BEGIN NOW In words which gen'ral approbation gain'd: END
BEGIN NOW One common largess is for all design'd, END
BEGIN NOW (The vanquish'd and the victor shall be join'd,) END
BEGIN NOW Two darts of polish'd steel and Gnosian wood, END
BEGIN NOW A silver-studded ax, alike bestow'd. END
BEGIN NOW The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed: END
BEGIN NOW The first of these obtains a stately steed, END
BEGIN NOW Adorn'd with trappings; and the next in fame, END
BEGIN NOW The quiver of an Amazonian dame, END
BEGIN NOW With feather'd Thracian arrows well supplied: END
BEGIN NOW A golden belt shall gird his manly side, END
BEGIN NOW Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied. END
BEGIN NOW The third this Grecian helmet shall content. END
BEGIN NOW He said. To their appointed base they went; END
BEGIN NOW With beating hearts th' expected sign receive, END
BEGIN NOW And, starting all at once, the barrier leave. END
BEGIN NOW Spread out, as on the winged winds, they flew, END
BEGIN NOW And seiz'd the distant goal with greedy view. END
BEGIN NOW Shot from the crowd, swift Nisus all o'erpass'd; END
BEGIN NOW Nor storms, nor thunder, equal half his haste. END
BEGIN NOW The next, but tho' the next, yet far disjoin'd, END
BEGIN NOW Came Salius, and Euryalus behind; END
BEGIN NOW Then Helymus, whom young Diores plied, END
BEGIN NOW Step after step, and almost side by side, END
BEGIN NOW His shoulders pressing; and, in longer space, END
BEGIN NOW Had won, or left at least a dubious race. END
BEGIN NOW Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last, END
BEGIN NOW When eager Nisus, hapless in his haste, END
BEGIN NOW Slipp'd first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain, END
BEGIN NOW Soak'd with the blood of oxen newly slain. END
BEGIN NOW The careless victor had not mark'd his way; END
BEGIN NOW But, treading where the treach'rous puddle lay, END
BEGIN NOW His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor END
BEGIN NOW He fell, besmear'd with filth and holy gore. END
BEGIN NOW Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee, END
BEGIN NOW Nor of the sacred bonds of amity, END
BEGIN NOW He strove th' immediate rival's hope to cross, END
BEGIN NOW And caught the foot of Salius as he rose. END
BEGIN NOW So Salius lay extended on the plain; END
BEGIN NOW Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain, END
BEGIN NOW And leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend END
BEGIN NOW The victor to the goal, who vanquish'd by his friend. END
BEGIN NOW Next Helymus; and then Diores came, END
BEGIN NOW By two misfortunes made the third in fame. END
BEGIN NOW But Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud END
BEGIN NOW For justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd; END
BEGIN NOW Urges his cause may in the court be heard; END
BEGIN NOW And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr'd. END
BEGIN NOW But favor for Euryalus appears; END
BEGIN NOW His blooming beauty, with his tender tears, END
BEGIN NOW Had brib'd the judges for the promis'd prize. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, Diores fills the court with cries, END
BEGIN NOW Who vainly reaches at the last reward, END
BEGIN NOW If the first palm on Salius be conferr'd. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus the prince: "Let no disputes arise: END
BEGIN NOW Where fortune plac'd it, I award the prize. END
BEGIN NOW But fortune's errors give me leave to mend, END
BEGIN NOW At least to pity my deserving friend. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and, from among the spoils, he draws END
BEGIN NOW (Pond'rous with shaggy mane and golden paws) END
BEGIN NOW A lion's hide: to Salius this he gives. END
BEGIN NOW Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves. END
BEGIN NOW If such rewards to vanquish'd men are due. END
BEGIN NOW He said, "and falling is to rise by you, END
BEGIN NOW What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim, END
BEGIN NOW Who merited the first rewards and fame? END
BEGIN NOW In falling, both an equal fortune tried; END
BEGIN NOW Would fortune for my fall so well provide! END
BEGIN NOW With this he pointed to his face, and show'd END
BEGIN NOW His hand and all his habit smear'd with blood. END
BEGIN NOW Th' indulgent father of the people smil'd, END
BEGIN NOW And caus'd to be produc'd an ample shield, END
BEGIN NOW Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought, END
BEGIN NOW Long since from Neptune's bars in triumph brought. END
BEGIN NOW This giv'n to Nisus, he divides the rest, END
BEGIN NOW And equal justice in his gifts express'd. END
BEGIN NOW The race thus ended, and rewards bestow'd, END
BEGIN NOW Once more the princes bespeaks th' attentive crowd: END
BEGIN NOW If there he here whose dauntless courage dare END
BEGIN NOW In gauntlet-fight, with limbs and body bare, END
BEGIN NOW His opposite sustain in open view, END
BEGIN NOW Stand forth the champion, and the games renew. END
BEGIN NOW Two prizes I propose, and thus divide: END
BEGIN NOW A bull with gilded horns, and fillets tied, END
BEGIN NOW Shall be the portion of the conqu'ring chief; END
BEGIN NOW A sword and helm shall cheer the loser's grief. END
BEGIN NOW Then haughty Dares in the lists appears; END
BEGIN NOW Stalking he strides, his head erected bears: END
BEGIN NOW His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield, END
BEGIN NOW And loud applauses echo thro' the field. END
BEGIN NOW Dares alone in combat us'd to stand END
BEGIN NOW The match of mighty Paris, hand to hand; END
BEGIN NOW The same, at Hector's fun'rals, undertook END
BEGIN NOW Gigantic Butes, of th' Amycian stock, END
BEGIN NOW And, by the stroke of his resistless hand, END
BEGIN NOW Stretch'd the vast bulk upon the yellow sand. END
BEGIN NOW Such Dares was; and such he strode along, END
BEGIN NOW And drew the wonder of the gazing throng. END
BEGIN NOW His brawny back and ample breast he shows, END
BEGIN NOW His lifted arms around his head he throws, END
BEGIN NOW And deals in whistling air his empty blows. END
BEGIN NOW His match is sought; but, thro' the trembling band, END
BEGIN NOW Not one dares answer to the proud demand. END
BEGIN NOW Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes END
BEGIN NOW Already he devours the promis'd prize. END
BEGIN NOW He claims the bull with awless insolence, END
BEGIN NOW And having seiz'd his horns, accosts the prince: END
BEGIN NOW If none my matchless valor dares oppose, END
BEGIN NOW Permit me, chief, permit without delay, END
BEGIN NOW To lead this uncontended gift away. END
BEGIN NOW The crowd assents, and with redoubled cries END
BEGIN NOW For the proud challenger demands the prize. END
BEGIN NOW Acestes, fir'd with just disdain, to see END
BEGIN NOW The palm usurp'd without a victory, END
BEGIN NOW Reproach'd Entellus thus, who sate beside, END
BEGIN NOW And heard and saw, unmov'd, the Trojan's pride: END
BEGIN NOW Once, but in vain, a champion of renown, END
BEGIN NOW So tamely can you bear the ravish'd crown, END
BEGIN NOW A prize in triumph borne before your sight, END
BEGIN NOW And shun, for fear, the danger of the fight? END
BEGIN NOW Where is our Eryx now, the boasted name, END
BEGIN NOW The god who taught your thund'ring arm the game? END
BEGIN NOW Where now your baffled honor? Where the spoil END
BEGIN NOW That fill'd your house, and fame that fill'd our isle? END
BEGIN NOW Entellus, thus: "My soul is still the same, END
BEGIN NOW Unmov'd with fear, and mov'd with martial fame; END
BEGIN NOW But my chill blood is curdled in my veins, END
BEGIN NOW And scarce the shadow of a man remains. END
BEGIN NOW O could I turn to that fair prime again, END
BEGIN NOW That prime of which this boaster is so vain, END
BEGIN NOW The brave, who this decrepid age defies, END
BEGIN NOW Should feel my force, without the promis'd prize. END
BEGIN NOW He said; and, rising at the word, he threw END
BEGIN NOW Two pond'rous gauntlets down in open view; END
BEGIN NOW Gauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield, END
BEGIN NOW And sheathe his hands with in the listed field. END
BEGIN NOW With fear and wonder seiz'd, the crowd beholds END
BEGIN NOW The gloves of death, with sev'n distinguish'd folds END
BEGIN NOW Of tough bull hides; the space within is spread END
BEGIN NOW With iron, or with loads of heavy lead: END
BEGIN NOW Dares himself was daunted at the sight, END
BEGIN NOW Renounc'd his challenge, and refus'd to fight. END
BEGIN NOW Astonish'd at their weight, the hero stands, END
BEGIN NOW And pois'd the pond'rous engines in his hands. END
BEGIN NOW What had your wonder," said Entellus, been, END
BEGIN NOW Had you the gauntlets of Alcides seen, END
BEGIN NOW Or view'd the stern debate on this unhappy green! END
BEGIN NOW These which I bear your brother Eryx bore, END
BEGIN NOW Still mark'd with batter'd brains and mingled gore. END
BEGIN NOW With these he long sustain'd th' Herculean arm; END
BEGIN NOW And these I wielded while my blood was warm, END
BEGIN NOW This languish'd frame while better spirits fed, END
BEGIN NOW Ere age unstrung my nerves, or time o'ersnow'd my head. END
BEGIN NOW But if the challenger these arms refuse, END
BEGIN NOW And cannot wield their weight, or dare not use; END
BEGIN NOW If great Aeneas and Acestes join END
BEGIN NOW In his request, these gauntlets I resign; END
BEGIN NOW Let us with equal arms perform the fight, END
BEGIN NOW And let him leave to fear, since I resign my right. END
BEGIN NOW This said, Entellus for the strife prepares; END
BEGIN NOW Stripp'd of his quilted coat, his body bares; END
BEGIN NOW Compos'd of mighty bones and brawn he stands, END
BEGIN NOW A goodly tow'ring object on the sands. END
BEGIN NOW Then just Aeneas equal arms supplied, END
BEGIN NOW Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied. END
BEGIN NOW Both on the tiptoe stand, at full extent, END
BEGIN NOW Their arms aloft, their bodies inly bent; END
BEGIN NOW Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar; END
BEGIN NOW With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war. END
BEGIN NOW One on his youth and pliant limbs relies; END
BEGIN NOW One on his sinews and his giant size. END
BEGIN NOW The last is stiff with age, his motion slow; END
BEGIN NOW He heaves for breath, he staggers to and fro, END
BEGIN NOW And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow. END
BEGIN NOW Yet equal in success, they ward, they strike; END
BEGIN NOW Their ways are diff'rent, but their art alike. END
BEGIN NOW Before, behind, the blows are dealt; around END
BEGIN NOW Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound. END
BEGIN NOW A storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies, END
BEGIN NOW And errs about their temples, ears, and eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Nor always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws END
BEGIN NOW A sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws. END
BEGIN NOW Heavy with age, Entellus stands his ground, END
BEGIN NOW But with his warping body wards the wound. END
BEGIN NOW His hand and watchful eye keep even pace; END
BEGIN NOW While Dares traverses and shifts his place, END
BEGIN NOW And, like a captain who beleaguers round END
BEGIN NOW Some strong-built castle on a rising ground, END
BEGIN NOW Views all th' approaches with observing eyes: END
BEGIN NOW This and that other part in vain he tries, END
BEGIN NOW And more on industry than force relies. END
BEGIN NOW With hands on high, Entellus threats the foe; END
BEGIN NOW But Dares watch'd the motion from below, END
BEGIN NOW And slipp'd aside, and shunn'd the long descending blow. END
BEGIN NOW Entellus wastes his forces on the wind, END
BEGIN NOW And, thus deluded of the stroke design'd, END
BEGIN NOW Headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast END
BEGIN NOW And weighty limbs his ancient mother press'd. END
BEGIN NOW So falls a hollow pine, that long had stood END
BEGIN NOW On Ida's height, or Erymanthus' wood, END
BEGIN NOW Torn from the roots. The diff'ring nations rise, END
BEGIN NOW And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies, END
BEGIN NOW Acestus runs with eager haste, to raise END
BEGIN NOW The fall'n companion of his youthful days. END
BEGIN NOW Dauntless he rose, and to the fight return'd; END
BEGIN NOW With shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn'd. END
BEGIN NOW Disdain and conscious virtue fir'd his breast, END
BEGIN NOW And with redoubled force his foe he press'd. END
BEGIN NOW He lays on load with either hand, amain, END
BEGIN NOW And headlong drives the Trojan o'er the plain; END
BEGIN NOW Nor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows; END
BEGIN NOW But storms of strokes descend about his brows, END
BEGIN NOW A rattling tempest, and a hail of blows. END
BEGIN NOW But now the prince, who saw the wild increase END
BEGIN NOW Of wounds, commands the combatants to cease, END
BEGIN NOW And bounds Entellus' wrath, and bids the peace. END
BEGIN NOW First to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came, END
BEGIN NOW And sooth'd his sorrow for the suffer'd shame. END
BEGIN NOW What fury seiz'd my friend? The gods," said he, END
BEGIN NOW To him propitious, and averse to thee, END
BEGIN NOW Have giv'n his arm superior force to thine. END
BEGIN NOW 'T is madness to contend with strength divine. END
BEGIN NOW The gauntlet fight thus ended, from the shore END
BEGIN NOW His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore: END
BEGIN NOW His mouth and nostrils pour'd a purple flood, END
BEGIN NOW And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood. END
BEGIN NOW Faintly he stagger'd thro' the hissing throng, END
BEGIN NOW And hung his head, and trail'd his legs along. END
BEGIN NOW The sword and casque are carried by his train; END
BEGIN NOW But with his foe the palm and ox remain. END
BEGIN NOW The champion, then, before Aeneas came, END
BEGIN NOW Proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame: END
BEGIN NOW O goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host, END
BEGIN NOW Mark with attention, and forgive my boast; END
BEGIN NOW Learn what I was, by what remains; and know END
BEGIN NOW From what impending fate you sav'd my foe. END
BEGIN NOW Sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull; END
BEGIN NOW And, on his ample forehead aiming full, END
BEGIN NOW The deadly stroke, descending, pierc'd the skull. END
BEGIN NOW Down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound, END
BEGIN NOW But sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Then, thus: "In Dares' stead I offer this. END
BEGIN NOW Eryx, accept a nobler sacrifice; END
BEGIN NOW Take the last gift my wither'd arms can yield: END
BEGIN NOW Thy gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field. END
BEGIN NOW This done, Aeneas orders, for the close, END
BEGIN NOW The strife of archers with contending bows. END
BEGIN NOW The mast Sergesthus' shatter'd galley bore END
BEGIN NOW With his own hands he raises on the shore. END
BEGIN NOW A flutt'ring dove upon the top they tie, END
BEGIN NOW The living mark at which their arrows fly. END
BEGIN NOW The rival archers in a line advance, END
BEGIN NOW Their turn of shooting to receive from chance. END
BEGIN NOW A helmet holds their names; the lots are drawn: END
BEGIN NOW On the first scroll was read Hippocoon. END
BEGIN NOW The people shout. Upon the next was found END
BEGIN NOW Young Mnestheus, late with naval honors crown'd. END
BEGIN NOW The third contain'd Eurytion's noble name, END
BEGIN NOW Thy brother, Pandarus, and next in fame, END
BEGIN NOW Whom Pallas urg'd the treaty to confound, END
BEGIN NOW And send among the Greeks a feather'd wound. END
BEGIN NOW Acestes in the bottom last remain'd, END
BEGIN NOW Whom not his age from youthful sports restrain'd. END
BEGIN NOW Soon all with vigor bend their trusty bows, END
BEGIN NOW And from the quiver each his arrow chose. END
BEGIN NOW Hippocoon's was the first: with forceful sway END
BEGIN NOW It flew, and, whizzing, cut the liquid way. END
BEGIN NOW Fix'd in the mast the feather'd weapon stands: END
BEGIN NOW The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands, END
BEGIN NOW And the tree trembled, and the shouting cries END
BEGIN NOW Of the pleas'd people rend the vaulted skies. END
BEGIN NOW Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove, END
BEGIN NOW With lifted eyes, and took his aim above, END
BEGIN NOW But made a glancing shot, and missed the dove; END
BEGIN NOW Yet miss'd so narrow, that he cut the cord END
BEGIN NOW Which fasten'd by the foot the flitting bird. END
BEGIN NOW The captive thus releas'd, away she flies, END
BEGIN NOW And beats with clapping wings the yielding skies. END
BEGIN NOW His bow already bent, Eurytion stood; END
BEGIN NOW And, having first invok'd his brother god, END
BEGIN NOW His winged shaft with eager haste he sped. END
BEGIN NOW The fatal message reach'd her as she fled: END
BEGIN NOW She leaves her life aloft; she strikes the ground, END
BEGIN NOW And renders back the weapon in the wound. END
BEGIN NOW Acestes, grudging at his lot, remains, END
BEGIN NOW Without a prize to gratify his pains. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show END
BEGIN NOW An archer's art, and boast his twanging bow. END
BEGIN NOW The feather'd arrow gave a dire portent, END
BEGIN NOW And latter augurs judge from this event. END
BEGIN NOW Chaf'd by the speed, it fir'd; and, as it flew, END
BEGIN NOW A trail of following flames ascending drew: END
BEGIN NOW Kindling they mount, and mark the shiny way; END
BEGIN NOW Across the skies as falling meteors play, END
BEGIN NOW And vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare, END
BEGIN NOW And, trembling, turn their wonder into pray'r. END
BEGIN NOW The Dardan prince put on a smiling face, END
BEGIN NOW And strain'd Acestes with a close embrace; END
BEGIN NOW Then, hon'ring him with gifts above the rest, END
BEGIN NOW Turn'd the bad omen, nor his fears confess'd. END
BEGIN NOW The gods," said he, "this miracle have wrought, END
BEGIN NOW And order'd you the prize without the lot. END
BEGIN NOW Accept this goblet, rough with figur'd gold, END
BEGIN NOW Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old: END
BEGIN NOW This pledge of ancient amity receive, END
BEGIN NOW Which to my second sire I justly give. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and, with the trumpets' cheerful sound, END
BEGIN NOW Proclaim'd him victor, and with laurel-crown'd. END
BEGIN NOW Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize, END
BEGIN NOW Tho' he transfix'd the pigeon in the skies. END
BEGIN NOW Who cut the line, with second gifts was grac'd; END
BEGIN NOW The third was his whose arrow pierc'd the mast. END
BEGIN NOW The chief, before the games were wholly done, END
BEGIN NOW Call'd Periphantes, tutor to his son, END
BEGIN NOW And whisper'd thus: "With speed Ascanius find; END
BEGIN NOW And, if his childish troop be ready join'd, END
BEGIN NOW On horseback let him grace his grandsire's day, END
BEGIN NOW And lead his equals arm'd in just array. END
BEGIN NOW He said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears. END
BEGIN NOW The crowd withdrawn, an open plain appears. END
BEGIN NOW And now the noble youths, of form divine, END
BEGIN NOW Advance before their fathers, in a line; END
BEGIN NOW The riders grace the steeds; the steeds with glory shine. END
BEGIN NOW Thus marching on in military pride, END
BEGIN NOW Shouts of applause resound from side to side. END
BEGIN NOW Their casques adorn'd with laurel wreaths they wear, END
BEGIN NOW Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear. END
BEGIN NOW Some at their backs their gilded quivers bore; END
BEGIN NOW Their chains of burnish'd gold hung down before. END
BEGIN NOW Three graceful troops they form'd upon the green; END
BEGIN NOW Three graceful leaders at their head were seen; END
BEGIN NOW Twelve follow'd ev'ry chief, and left a space between. END
BEGIN NOW The first young Priam led; a lovely boy, END
BEGIN NOW Whose grandsire was th' unhappy king of Troy; END
BEGIN NOW His race in after times was known to fame, END
BEGIN NOW New honors adding to the Latian name; END
BEGIN NOW And well the royal boy his Thracian steed became. END
BEGIN NOW White were the fetlocks of his feet before, END
BEGIN NOW And on his front a snowy star he bore. END
BEGIN NOW Then beauteous Atys, with Iulus bred, END
BEGIN NOW Of equal age, the second squadron led. END
BEGIN NOW The last in order, but the first in place, END
BEGIN NOW First in the lovely features of his face, END
BEGIN NOW Rode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed, END
BEGIN NOW Queen Dido's gift, and of the Tyrian breed. END
BEGIN NOW Sure coursers for the rest the king ordains, END
BEGIN NOW With golden bits adorn'd, and purple reins. END
BEGIN NOW The pleas'd spectators peals of shouts renew, END
BEGIN NOW And all the parents in the children view; END
BEGIN NOW Their make, their motions, and their sprightly grace, END
BEGIN NOW And hopes and fears alternate in their face. END
BEGIN NOW Th' unfledg'd commanders and their martial train END
BEGIN NOW First make the circuit of the sandy plain END
BEGIN NOW Around their sires, and, at th' appointed sign, END
BEGIN NOW Drawn up in beauteous order, form a line. END
BEGIN NOW The second signal sounds, the troop divides END
BEGIN NOW In three distinguish'd parts, with three distinguish'd guides END
BEGIN NOW Again they close, and once again disjoin; END
BEGIN NOW In troop to troop oppos'd, and line to line. END
BEGIN NOW They meet; they wheel; they throw their darts afar END
BEGIN NOW With harmless rage and well-dissembled war. END
BEGIN NOW Then in a round the mingled bodies run: END
BEGIN NOW Flying they follow, and pursuing shun; END
BEGIN NOW Broken, they break; and, rallying, they renew END
BEGIN NOW In other forms the military shew. END
BEGIN NOW At last, in order, undiscern'd they join, END
BEGIN NOW And march together in a friendly line. END
BEGIN NOW And, as the Cretan labyrinth of old, END
BEGIN NOW With wand'ring ways and many a winding fold, END
BEGIN NOW Involv'd the weary feet, without redress, END
BEGIN NOW In a round error, which denied recess; END
BEGIN NOW So fought the Trojan boys in warlike play, END
BEGIN NOW Turn'd and return'd, and still a diff'rent way. END
BEGIN NOW Thus dolphins in the deep each other chase END
BEGIN NOW In circles, when they swim around the wat'ry race. END
BEGIN NOW This game, these carousels, Ascanius taught; END
BEGIN NOW And, building Alba, to the Latins brought; END
BEGIN NOW Shew'd what he learn'd: the Latin sires impart END
BEGIN NOW To their succeeding sons the graceful art; END
BEGIN NOW From these imperial Rome receiv'd the game, END
BEGIN NOW Which Troy, the youths the Trojan troop, they name. END
BEGIN NOW Thus far the sacred sports they celebrate: END
BEGIN NOW But Fortune soon resum'd her ancient hate; END
BEGIN NOW For, while they pay the dead his annual dues, END
BEGIN NOW Those envied rites Saturnian Juno views; END
BEGIN NOW And sends the goddess of the various bow, END
BEGIN NOW To try new methods of revenge below; END
BEGIN NOW Supplies the winds to wing her airy way, END
BEGIN NOW Where in the port secure the navy lay. END
BEGIN NOW Swiftly fair Iris down her arch descends, END
BEGIN NOW And, undiscern'd, her fatal voyage ends. END
BEGIN NOW She saw the gath'ring crowd; and, gliding thence, END
BEGIN NOW The desart shore, and fleet without defense. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan matrons, on the sands alone, END
BEGIN NOW With sighs and tears Anchises' death bemoan; END
BEGIN NOW Then, turning to the sea their weeping eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Their pity to themselves renews their cries. END
BEGIN NOW Alas! said one, "what oceans yet remain END
BEGIN NOW For us to sail! what labors to sustain! END
BEGIN NOW All take the word, and, with a gen'ral groan, END
BEGIN NOW Implore the gods for peace, and places of their own. END
BEGIN NOW The goddess, great in mischief, views their pains, END
BEGIN NOW And in a woman's form her heav'nly limbs restrains. END
BEGIN NOW In face and shape old Beroe she became, END
BEGIN NOW Doryclus' wife, a venerable dame, END
BEGIN NOW Once blest with riches, and a mother's name. END
BEGIN NOW Thus chang'd, amidst the crying crowd she ran, END
BEGIN NOW Mix'd with the matrons, and these words began: END
BEGIN NOW O wretched we, whom not the Grecian pow'r, END
BEGIN NOW Nor flames, destroy'd, in Troy's unhappy hour! END
BEGIN NOW O wretched we, reserv'd by cruel fate, END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the ruins of the sinking state! END
BEGIN NOW Now sev'n revolving years are wholly run, END
BEGIN NOW Since this improsp'rous voyage we begun; END
BEGIN NOW Since, toss'd from shores to shores, from lands to lands, END
BEGIN NOW Inhospitable rocks and barren sands, END
BEGIN NOW Wand'ring in exile thro' the stormy sea, END
BEGIN NOW We search in vain for flying Italy. END
BEGIN NOW Now cast by fortune on this kindred land, END
BEGIN NOW What should our rest and rising walls withstand, END
BEGIN NOW Or hinder here to fix our banish'd band? END
BEGIN NOW O country lost, and gods redeem'd in vain, END
BEGIN NOW If still in endless exile we remain! END
BEGIN NOW Shall we no more the Trojan walls renew, END
BEGIN NOW Or streams of some dissembled Simois view! END
BEGIN NOW Haste, join with me, th' unhappy fleet consume! END
BEGIN NOW Cassandra bids; and I declare her doom. END
BEGIN NOW In sleep I saw her; she supplied my hands END
BEGIN NOW (For this I more than dreamt) with flaming brands: END
BEGIN NOW 'With these,' said she, 'these wand'ring ships destroy: END
BEGIN NOW These are your fatal seats, and this your Troy.' END
BEGIN NOW Time calls you now; the precious hour employ: END
BEGIN NOW Slack not the good presage, while Heav'n inspires END
BEGIN NOW Our minds to dare, and gives the ready fires. END
BEGIN NOW See! Neptune's altars minister their brands: END
BEGIN NOW The god is pleas'd; the god supplies our hands. END
BEGIN NOW Then from the pile a flaming fire she drew, END
BEGIN NOW And, toss'd in air, amidst the galleys threw. END
BEGIN NOW Wrapp'd in amaze, the matrons wildly stare: END
BEGIN NOW Then Pyrgo, reverenc'd for her hoary hair, END
BEGIN NOW Pyrgo, the nurse of Priam's num'rous race: END
BEGIN NOW No Beroe this, tho' she belies her face! END
BEGIN NOW What terrors from her frowning front arise! END
BEGIN NOW Behold a goddess in her ardent eyes! END
BEGIN NOW What rays around her heav'nly face are seen! END
BEGIN NOW Mark her majestic voice, and more than mortal mien! END
BEGIN NOW Beroe but now I left, whom, pin'd with pain, END
BEGIN NOW Her age and anguish from these rites detain, END
BEGIN NOW She said. The matrons, seiz'd with new amaze, END
BEGIN NOW Roll their malignant eyes, and on the navy gaze. END
BEGIN NOW They fear, and hope, and neither part obey: END
BEGIN NOW They hope the fated land, but fear the fatal way. END
BEGIN NOW The goddess, having done her task below, END
BEGIN NOW Mounts up on equal wings, and bends her painted bow. END
BEGIN NOW Struck with the sight, and seiz'd with rage divine, END
BEGIN NOW The matrons prosecute their mad design: END
BEGIN NOW They shriek aloud; they snatch, with impious hands, END
BEGIN NOW The food of altars; fires and flaming brands. END
BEGIN NOW Green boughs and saplings, mingled in their haste, END
BEGIN NOW And smoking torches, on the ships they cast. END
BEGIN NOW The flame, unstopp'd at first, more fury gains, END
BEGIN NOW And Vulcan rides at large with loosen'd reins: END
BEGIN NOW Triumphant to the painted sterns he soars, END
BEGIN NOW And seizes, in this way, the banks and crackling oars. END
BEGIN NOW Eumelus was the first the news to bear, END
BEGIN NOW While yet they crowd the rural theater. END
BEGIN NOW Then, what they hear, is witness'd by their eyes: END
BEGIN NOW A storm of sparkles and of flames arise. END
BEGIN NOW Ascanius took th' alarm, while yet he led END
BEGIN NOW His early warriors on his prancing steed, END
BEGIN NOW And, spurring on, his equals soon o'erpass'd; END
BEGIN NOW Nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste. END
BEGIN NOW Soon as the royal youth appear'd in view, END
BEGIN NOW He sent his voice before him as he flew: END
BEGIN NOW What madness moves you, matrons, to destroy END
BEGIN NOW The last remainders of unhappy Troy! END
BEGIN NOW Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn, END
BEGIN NOW And on your friends your fatal fury turn. END
BEGIN NOW Behold your own Ascanius!" While he said, END
BEGIN NOW He drew his glitt'ring helmet from his head, END
BEGIN NOW In which the youths to sportful arms he led. END
BEGIN NOW By this, Aeneas and his train appear; END
BEGIN NOW And now the women, seiz'd with shame and fear, END
BEGIN NOW Dispers'd, to woods and caverns take their flight, END
BEGIN NOW Abhor their actions, and avoid the light; END
BEGIN NOW Their friends acknowledge, and their error find, END
BEGIN NOW And shake the goddess from their alter'd mind. END
BEGIN NOW Not so the raging fires their fury cease, END
BEGIN NOW But, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace, END
BEGIN NOW Work on their way amid the smold'ring tow, END
BEGIN NOW Sure in destruction, but in motion slow. END
BEGIN NOW The silent plague thro' the green timber eats, END
BEGIN NOW Down to the keels, and upward to the sails, END
BEGIN NOW The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails; END
BEGIN NOW Nor buckets pour'd, nor strength of human hand, END
BEGIN NOW Can the victorious element withstand. END
BEGIN NOW The pious hero rends his robe, and throws END
BEGIN NOW To heav'n his hands, and with his hands his vows. END
BEGIN NOW O Jove," he cried, "if pray'rs can yet have place; END
BEGIN NOW If thou abhorr'st not all the Dardan race; END
BEGIN NOW If any spark of pity still remain; END
BEGIN NOW If gods are gods, and not invok'd in vain; END
BEGIN NOW Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train! END
BEGIN NOW Yet from the flames our burning vessels free, END
BEGIN NOW Or let thy fury fall alone on me! END
BEGIN NOW At this devoted head thy thunder throw, END
BEGIN NOW And send the willing sacrifice below! END
BEGIN NOW Scarce had he said, when southern storms arise: END
BEGIN NOW From pole to pole the forky lightning flies; END
BEGIN NOW Loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain; END
BEGIN NOW Heav'n bellies downward, and descends in rain. END
BEGIN NOW Whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent, END
BEGIN NOW Which, hissing thro' the planks, the flames prevent, END
BEGIN NOW And stop the fiery pest. Four ships alone END
BEGIN NOW Burn to the waist, and for the fleet atone. END
BEGIN NOW But doubtful thoughts the hero's heart divide; END
BEGIN NOW If he should still in Sicily reside, END
BEGIN NOW Forgetful of his fates, or tempt the main, END
BEGIN NOW In hope the promis'd Italy to gain. END
BEGIN NOW Then Nautes, old and wise, to whom alone END
BEGIN NOW The will of Heav'n by Pallas was foreshown; END
BEGIN NOW Vers'd in portents, experienc'd, and inspir'd END
BEGIN NOW To tell events, and what the fates requir'd; END
BEGIN NOW Thus while he stood, to neither part inclin'd, END
BEGIN NOW With cheerful words reliev'd his lab'ring mind: END
BEGIN NOW O goddess-born, resign'd in ev'ry state, END
BEGIN NOW With patience bear, with prudence push your fate. END
BEGIN NOW By suff'ring well, our Fortune we subdue; END
BEGIN NOW Fly when she frowns, and, when she calls, pursue. END
BEGIN NOW Your friend Acestes is of Trojan kind; END
BEGIN NOW To him disclose the secrets of your mind: END
BEGIN NOW Trust in his hands your old and useless train; END
BEGIN NOW Too num'rous for the ships which yet remain: END
BEGIN NOW The feeble, old, indulgent of their ease, END
BEGIN NOW The dames who dread the dangers of the seas, END
BEGIN NOW The shock of battle with your foes by land. END
BEGIN NOW Here you may build a common town for all, END
BEGIN NOW And, from Acestes' name, Acesta call. END
BEGIN NOW The reasons, with his friend's experience join'd, END
BEGIN NOW Encourag'd much, but more disturb'd his mind. END
BEGIN NOW 'T was dead of night; when to his slumb'ring eyes END
BEGIN NOW His father's shade descended from the skies, END
BEGIN NOW And thus he spoke: "O more than vital breath, END
BEGIN NOW Lov'd while I liv'd, and dear ev'n after death; END
BEGIN NOW O son, in various toils and troubles toss'd, END
BEGIN NOW The King of Heav'n employs my careful ghost END
BEGIN NOW On his commands: the god, who sav'd from fire END
BEGIN NOW Your flaming fleet, and heard your just desire. END
BEGIN NOW The wholesome counsel of your friend receive, END
BEGIN NOW And here the coward train and woman leave: END
BEGIN NOW The chosen youth, and those who nobly dare, END
BEGIN NOW Transport, to tempt the dangers of the war. END
BEGIN NOW The stern Italians will their courage try; END
BEGIN NOW Rough are their manners, and their minds are high. END
BEGIN NOW But first to Pluto's palace you shall go, END
BEGIN NOW And seek my shade among the blest below: END
BEGIN NOW For not with impious ghosts my soul remains, END
BEGIN NOW Nor suffers with the damn'd perpetual pains, END
BEGIN NOW But breathes the living air of soft Elysian plains. END
BEGIN NOW The chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey, END
BEGIN NOW And blood of offer'd victims free the way. END
BEGIN NOW There shall you know what realms the gods assign, END
BEGIN NOW And learn the fates and fortunes of your line. END
BEGIN NOW But now, farewell! I vanish with the night, END
BEGIN NOW And feel the blast of heav'n's approaching light. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and mix'd with shades, and took his airy flight. END
BEGIN NOW Whither so fast?" the filial duty cried; END
BEGIN NOW And why, ah why, the wish'd embrace denied? END
BEGIN NOW He said, and rose; as holy zeal inspires, END
BEGIN NOW He rakes hot embers, and renews the fires; END
BEGIN NOW His country gods and Vesta then adores END
BEGIN NOW With cakes and incense, and their aid implores. END
BEGIN NOW Next, for his friends and royal host he sent, END
BEGIN NOW Reveal'd his vision, and the gods' intent, END
BEGIN NOW With his own purpose. All, without delay, END
BEGIN NOW The will of Jove, and his desires obey. END
BEGIN NOW They list with women each degenerate name, END
BEGIN NOW Who dares not hazard life for future fame. END
BEGIN NOW These they cashier: the brave remaining few, END
BEGIN NOW Oars, banks, and cables, half consum'd, renew. END
BEGIN NOW The prince designs a city with the plow; END
BEGIN NOW The lots their sev'ral tenements allow. END
BEGIN NOW This part is nam'd from Ilium, that from Troy, END
BEGIN NOW And the new king ascends the throne with joy; END
BEGIN NOW A chosen senate from the people draws; END
BEGIN NOW Appoints the judges, and ordains the laws. END
BEGIN NOW Then, on the top of Eryx, they begin END
BEGIN NOW A rising temple to the Paphian queen. END
BEGIN NOW Anchises, last, is honor'd as a god; END
BEGIN NOW A priest is added, annual gifts bestow'd, END
BEGIN NOW And groves are planted round his blest abode. END
BEGIN NOW Nine days they pass in feasts, their temples crown'd; END
BEGIN NOW And fumes of incense in the fanes abound. END
BEGIN NOW Then from the south arose a gentle breeze END
BEGIN NOW That curl'd the smoothness of the glassy seas; END
BEGIN NOW The rising winds a ruffling gale afford, END
BEGIN NOW And call the merry mariners aboard. END
BEGIN NOW Now loud laments along the shores resound, END
BEGIN NOW Of parting friends in close embraces bound. END
BEGIN NOW The trembling women, the degenerate train, END
BEGIN NOW Who shunn'd the frightful dangers of the main, END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n those desire to sail, and take their share END
BEGIN NOW Of the rough passage and the promis'd war: END
BEGIN NOW Whom good Aeneas cheers, and recommends END
BEGIN NOW To their new master's care his fearful friends. END
BEGIN NOW On Eryx's altars three fat calves he lays; END
BEGIN NOW A lamb new-fallen to the stormy seas; END
BEGIN NOW Then slips his haulsers, and his anchors weighs. END
BEGIN NOW High on the deck the godlike hero stands, END
BEGIN NOW With olive crown'd, a charger in his hands; END
BEGIN NOW Then cast the reeking entrails in the brine, END
BEGIN NOW And pour'd the sacrifice of purple wine. END
BEGIN NOW Fresh gales arise; with equal strokes they vie, END
BEGIN NOW And brush the buxom seas, and o'er the billows fly. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime the mother goddess, full of fears, END
BEGIN NOW To Neptune thus address'd, with tender tears: END
BEGIN NOW The pride of Jove's imperious queen, the rage, END
BEGIN NOW The malice which no suff'rings can assuage, END
BEGIN NOW Compel me to these pray'rs; since neither fate, END
BEGIN NOW Nor time, nor pity, can remove her hate: END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife; END
BEGIN NOW Still vanquish'd, yet she still renews the strife. END
BEGIN NOW As if 't were little to consume the town END
BEGIN NOW Which aw'd the world, and wore th' imperial crown, END
BEGIN NOW She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains, END
BEGIN NOW And gnaws, ev'n to the bones, the last remains. END
BEGIN NOW Let her the causes of her hatred tell; END
BEGIN NOW But you can witness its effects too well. END
BEGIN NOW You saw the storm she rais'd on Libyan floods, END
BEGIN NOW That mix'd the mounting billows with the clouds; END
BEGIN NOW When, bribing Aeolus, she shook the main, END
BEGIN NOW And mov'd rebellion in your wat'ry reign. END
BEGIN NOW With fury she possess'd the Dardan dames, END
BEGIN NOW To burn their fleet with execrable flames, END
BEGIN NOW And forc'd Aeneas, when his ships were lost, END
BEGIN NOW To leave his foll'wers on a foreign coast. END
BEGIN NOW For what remains, your godhead I implore, END
BEGIN NOW And trust my son to your protecting pow'r. END
BEGIN NOW If neither Jove's nor Fate's decree withstand, END
BEGIN NOW Secure his passage to the Latian land. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main: END
BEGIN NOW What may not Venus hope from Neptune's reign? END
BEGIN NOW My kingdom claims your birth; my late defense END
BEGIN NOW Of your indanger'd fleet may claim your confidence. END
BEGIN NOW Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare END
BEGIN NOW How much your lov'd Aeneas is my care. END
BEGIN NOW Thee, Xanthus, and thee, Simois, I attest. END
BEGIN NOW Your Trojan troops when proud Achilles press'd, END
BEGIN NOW And drove before him headlong on the plain, END
BEGIN NOW And dash'd against the walls the trembling train; END
BEGIN NOW When floods were fill'd with bodies of the slain; END
BEGIN NOW When crimson Xanthus, doubtful of his way, END
BEGIN NOW Stood up on ridges to behold the sea; END
BEGIN NOW (New heaps came tumbling in, and chok'd his way;) END
BEGIN NOW When your Aeneas fought, but fought with odds END
BEGIN NOW Of force unequal, and unequal gods; END
BEGIN NOW I spread a cloud before the victor's sight, END
BEGIN NOW Sustain'd the vanquish'd, and secur'd his flight; END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n then secur'd him, when I sought with joy END
BEGIN NOW The vow'd destruction of ungrateful Troy. END
BEGIN NOW My will's the same: fair goddess, fear no more, END
BEGIN NOW Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore; END
BEGIN NOW Their lives are giv'n; one destin'd head alone END
BEGIN NOW Shall perish, and for multitudes atone. END
BEGIN NOW Thus having arm'd with hopes her anxious mind, END
BEGIN NOW His finny team Saturnian Neptune join'd, END
BEGIN NOW Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws, END
BEGIN NOW And to the loosen'd reins permits the laws. END
BEGIN NOW High on the waves his azure car he guides; END
BEGIN NOW Its axles thunder, and the sea subsides, END
BEGIN NOW And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides. END
BEGIN NOW The tempests fly before their father's face, END
BEGIN NOW Trains of inferior gods his triumph grace, END
BEGIN NOW And monster whales before their master play, END
BEGIN NOW And choirs of Tritons crowd the wat'ry way. END
BEGIN NOW The marshal'd pow'rs in equal troops divide END
BEGIN NOW To right and left; the gods his better side END
BEGIN NOW Inclose, and on the worse the Nymphs and Nereids ride. END
BEGIN NOW Now smiling hope, with sweet vicissitude, END
BEGIN NOW Within the hero's mind his joys renew'd. END
BEGIN NOW He calls to raise the masts, the sheets display; END
BEGIN NOW The cheerful crew with diligence obey; END
BEGIN NOW They scud before the wind, and sail in open sea. END
BEGIN NOW Ahead of all the master pilot steers; END
BEGIN NOW And, as he leads, the following navy veers. END
BEGIN NOW The steeds of Night had travel'd half the sky, END
BEGIN NOW The drowsy rowers on their benches lie, END
BEGIN NOW When the soft God of Sleep, with easy flight, END
BEGIN NOW Descends, and draws behind a trail of light. END
BEGIN NOW Thou, Palinurus, art his destin'd prey; END
BEGIN NOW To thee alone he takes his fatal way. END
BEGIN NOW Dire dreams to thee, and iron sleep, he bears; END
BEGIN NOW And, lighting on thy prow, the form of Phorbas wears. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus the traitor god began his tale: END
BEGIN NOW The winds, my friend, inspire a pleasing gale; END
BEGIN NOW The ships, without thy care, securely sail. END
BEGIN NOW Now steal an hour of sweet repose; and I END
BEGIN NOW Will take the rudder and thy room supply. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the yawning pilot, half asleep: END
BEGIN NOW Me dost thou bid to trust the treach'rous deep, END
BEGIN NOW The harlot smiles of her dissembling face, END
BEGIN NOW And to her faith commit the Trojan race? END
BEGIN NOW Shall I believe the Siren South again, END
BEGIN NOW And, oft betray'd, not know the monster main? END
BEGIN NOW He said: his fasten'd hands the rudder keep, END
BEGIN NOW And, fix'd on heav'n, his eyes repel invading sleep. END
BEGIN NOW The god was wroth, and at his temples threw END
BEGIN NOW A branch in Lethe dipp'd, and drunk with Stygian dew: END
BEGIN NOW The pilot, vanquish'd by the pow'r divine, END
BEGIN NOW Soon clos'd his swimming eyes, and lay supine. END
BEGIN NOW Scarce were his limbs extended at their length, END
BEGIN NOW The god, insulting with superior strength, END
BEGIN NOW Fell heavy on him, plung'd him in the sea, END
BEGIN NOW And, with the stern, the rudder tore away. END
BEGIN NOW Headlong he fell, and, struggling in the main, END
BEGIN NOW Cried out for helping hands, but cried in vain. END
BEGIN NOW The victor daemon mounts obscure in air, END
BEGIN NOW While the ship sails without the pilot's care. END
BEGIN NOW On Neptune's faith the floating fleet relies; END
BEGIN NOW But what the man forsook, the god supplies, END
BEGIN NOW And o'er the dang'rous deep secure the navy flies; END
BEGIN NOW Glides by the Sirens' cliffs, a shelfy coast, END
BEGIN NOW Long infamous for ships and sailors lost, END
BEGIN NOW And white with bones. Th' impetuous ocean roars, END
BEGIN NOW And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores. END
BEGIN NOW The watchful hero felt the knocks, and found END
BEGIN NOW The tossing vessel sail'd on shoaly ground. END
BEGIN NOW Sure of his pilot's loss, he takes himself END
BEGIN NOW The helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf. END
BEGIN NOW Inly he griev'd, and, groaning from the breast, END
BEGIN NOW Deplor'd his death; and thus his pain express'd: END
BEGIN NOW For faith repos'd on seas, and on the flatt'ring sky, END
BEGIN NOW Thy naked corpse is doom'd on shores unknown to lie. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and wept; then spread his sails before END
BEGIN NOW The winds, and reach'd at length the Cumaean shore: END
BEGIN NOW Their anchors dropp'd, his crew the vessels moor. END
BEGIN NOW They turn their heads to sea, their sterns to land, END
BEGIN NOW And greet with greedy joy th' Italian strand. END
BEGIN NOW Some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed; END
BEGIN NOW Some gather sticks, the kindled flames to feed, END
BEGIN NOW Or search for hollow trees, and fell the woods, END
BEGIN NOW Or trace thro' valleys the discover'd floods. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, while their sev'ral charges they fulfil, END
BEGIN NOW The pious prince ascends the sacred hill END
BEGIN NOW Where Phoebus is ador'd; and seeks the shade END
BEGIN NOW Which hides from sight his venerable maid. END
BEGIN NOW Deep in a cave the Sibyl makes abode; END
BEGIN NOW Thence full of fate returns, and of the god. END
BEGIN NOW Thro' Trivia's grove they walk; and now behold, END
BEGIN NOW And enter now, the temple roof'd with gold. END
BEGIN NOW When Daedalus, to fly the Cretan shore, END
BEGIN NOW His heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore, END
BEGIN NOW (The first who sail'd in air,) 't is sung by Fame, END
BEGIN NOW To the Cumaean coast at length he came, END
BEGIN NOW And here alighting, built this costly frame. END
BEGIN NOW Inscrib'd to Phoebus, here he hung on high END
BEGIN NOW The steerage of his wings, that cut the sky: END
BEGIN NOW Then o'er the lofty gate his art emboss'd END
BEGIN NOW Androgeos' death, and off'rings to his ghost; END
BEGIN NOW Sev'n youths from Athens yearly sent, to meet END
BEGIN NOW The fate appointed by revengeful Crete. END
BEGIN NOW And next to those the dreadful urn was plac'd, END
BEGIN NOW In which the destin'd names by lots were cast: END
BEGIN NOW The mournful parents stand around in tears, END
BEGIN NOW And rising Crete against their shore appears. END
BEGIN NOW There too, in living sculpture, might be seen END
BEGIN NOW The mad affection of the Cretan queen; END
BEGIN NOW Then how she cheats her bellowing lover's eye; END
BEGIN NOW The rushing leap, the doubtful progeny, END
BEGIN NOW The lower part a beast, a man above, END
BEGIN NOW The monument of their polluted love. END
BEGIN NOW Not far from thence he grav'd the wondrous maze, END
BEGIN NOW A thousand doors, a thousand winding ways: END
BEGIN NOW Here dwells the monster, hid from human view, END
BEGIN NOW Not to be found, but by the faithful clew; END
BEGIN NOW Till the kind artist, mov'd with pious grief, END
BEGIN NOW Lent to the loving maid this last relief, END
BEGIN NOW And all those erring paths describ'd so well END
BEGIN NOW That Theseus conquer'd and the monster fell. END
BEGIN NOW Here hapless Icarus had found his part, END
BEGIN NOW Had not the father's grief restrain'd his art. END
BEGIN NOW He twice assay'd to cast his son in gold; END
BEGIN NOW Twice from his hands he dropp'd the forming mold. END
BEGIN NOW All this with wond'ring eyes Aeneas view'd; END
BEGIN NOW Each varying object his delight renew'd: END
BEGIN NOW Eager to read the rest- Achates came, END
BEGIN NOW And by his side the mad divining dame, END
BEGIN NOW The priestess of the god, Deiphobe her name. END
BEGIN NOW Time suffers not," she said, "to feed your eyes END
BEGIN NOW With empty pleasures; haste the sacrifice. END
BEGIN NOW Sev'n bullocks, yet unyok'd, for Phoebus choose, END
BEGIN NOW And for Diana sev'n unspotted ewes. END
BEGIN NOW This said, the servants urge the sacred rites, END
BEGIN NOW While to the temple she the prince invites. END
BEGIN NOW A spacious cave, within its farmost part, END
BEGIN NOW Was hew'd and fashion'd by laborious art END
BEGIN NOW Thro' the hill's hollow sides: before the place, END
BEGIN NOW A hundred doors a hundred entries grace; END
BEGIN NOW As many voices issue, and the sound END
BEGIN NOW Of Sybil's words as many times rebound. END
BEGIN NOW Now to the mouth they come. Aloud she cries: END
BEGIN NOW This is the time; enquire your destinies. END
BEGIN NOW He comes; behold the god!" Thus while she said, END
BEGIN NOW (And shiv'ring at the sacred entry stay'd,) END
BEGIN NOW Her color chang'd; her face was not the same, END
BEGIN NOW And hollow groans from her deep spirit came. END
BEGIN NOW Her hair stood up; convulsive rage possess'd END
BEGIN NOW Her trembling limbs, and heav'd her lab'ring breast. END
BEGIN NOW Greater than humankind she seem'd to look, END
BEGIN NOW And with an accent more than mortal spoke. END
BEGIN NOW Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll; END
BEGIN NOW When all the god came rushing on her soul. END
BEGIN NOW Swiftly she turn'd, and, foaming as she spoke: END
BEGIN NOW Why this delay?" she cried- "the pow'rs invoke! END
BEGIN NOW Thy pray'rs alone can open this abode; END
BEGIN NOW She said no more. The trembling Trojans hear, END
BEGIN NOW O'erspread with a damp sweat and holy fear. END
BEGIN NOW The prince himself, with awful dread possess'd, END
BEGIN NOW His vows to great Apollo thus address'd: END
BEGIN NOW Indulgent god, propitious pow'r to Troy, END
BEGIN NOW Swift to relieve, unwilling to destroy, END
BEGIN NOW Directed by whose hand the Dardan dart END
BEGIN NOW Pierc'd the proud Grecian's only mortal part: END
BEGIN NOW Thus far, by fate's decrees and thy commands, END
BEGIN NOW Thro' ambient seas and thro' devouring sands, END
BEGIN NOW Our exil'd crew has sought th' Ausonian ground; END
BEGIN NOW And now, at length, the flying coast is found. END
BEGIN NOW Thus far the fate of Troy, from place to place, END
BEGIN NOW With fury has pursued her wand'ring race. END
BEGIN NOW Here cease, ye pow'rs, and let your vengeance end: END
BEGIN NOW Troy is no more, and can no more offend. END
BEGIN NOW And thou, O sacred maid, inspir'd to see END
BEGIN NOW Th' event of things in dark futurity; END
BEGIN NOW Give me what Heav'n has promis'd to my fate, END
BEGIN NOW To conquer and command the Latian state; END
BEGIN NOW To fix my wand'ring gods, and find a place END
BEGIN NOW For the long exiles of the Trojan race. END
BEGIN NOW Then shall my grateful hands a temple rear END
BEGIN NOW To the twin gods, with vows and solemn pray'r; END
BEGIN NOW And annual rites, and festivals, and games, END
BEGIN NOW Shall be perform'd to their auspicious names. END
BEGIN NOW Nor shalt thou want thy honors in my land; END
BEGIN NOW For there thy faithful oracles shall stand, END
BEGIN NOW Preserv'd in shrines; and ev'ry sacred lay, END
BEGIN NOW Which, by thy mouth, Apollo shall convey: END
BEGIN NOW All shall be treasur'd by a chosen train END
BEGIN NOW Of holy priests, and ever shall remain. END
BEGIN NOW But O! commit not thy prophetic mind END
BEGIN NOW To flitting leaves, the sport of ev'ry wind, END
BEGIN NOW Lest they disperse in air our empty fate; END
BEGIN NOW Write not, but, what the pow'rs ordain, relate. END
BEGIN NOW Struggling in vain, impatient of her load, END
BEGIN NOW And lab'ring underneath the pond'rous god, END
BEGIN NOW The more she strove to shake him from her breast, END
BEGIN NOW With more and far superior force he press'd; END
BEGIN NOW Commands his entrance, and, without control, END
BEGIN NOW Usurps her organs and inspires her soul. END
BEGIN NOW Now, with a furious blast, the hundred doors END
BEGIN NOW Ope of themselves; a rushing whirlwind roars END
BEGIN NOW Within the cave, and Sibyl's voice restores: END
BEGIN NOW Escap'd the dangers of the wat'ry reign, END
BEGIN NOW Yet more and greater ills by land remain. END
BEGIN NOW The coast, so long desir'd (nor doubt th' event), END
BEGIN NOW Thy troops shall reach, but, having reach'd, repent. END
BEGIN NOW Wars, horrid wars, I view- a field of blood, END
BEGIN NOW And Tiber rolling with a purple flood. END
BEGIN NOW Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there: END
BEGIN NOW A new Achilles shall in arms appear, END
BEGIN NOW And he, too, goddess-born. Fierce Juno's hate, END
BEGIN NOW Added to hostile force, shall urge thy fate. END
BEGIN NOW To what strange nations shalt not thou resort, END
BEGIN NOW Driv'n to solicit aid at ev'ry court! END
BEGIN NOW The cause the same which Ilium once oppress'd; END
BEGIN NOW A foreign mistress, and a foreign guest. END
BEGIN NOW But thou, secure of soul, unbent with woes, END
BEGIN NOW The more thy fortune frowns, the more oppose. END
BEGIN NOW The dawnings of thy safety shall be shown END
BEGIN NOW From whence thou least shalt hope, a Grecian town. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke, END
BEGIN NOW And the resisting air the thunder broke; END
BEGIN NOW The cave rebellow'd, and the temple shook. END
BEGIN NOW Th' ambiguous god, who rul'd her lab'ring breast, END
BEGIN NOW In these mysterious words his mind express'd; END
BEGIN NOW Some truths reveal'd, in terms involv'd the rest. END
BEGIN NOW At length her fury fell, her foaming ceas'd, END
BEGIN NOW And, ebbing in her soul, the god decreas'd. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus the chief: "No terror to my view, END
BEGIN NOW No frightful face of danger can be new. END
BEGIN NOW Inur'd to suffer, and resolv'd to dare, END
BEGIN NOW The Fates, without my pow'r, shall be without my care. END
BEGIN NOW This let me crave, since near your grove the road END
BEGIN NOW To hell lies open, and the dark abode END
BEGIN NOW Which Acheron surrounds, th' innavigable flood; END
BEGIN NOW Conduct me thro' the regions void of light, END
BEGIN NOW And lead me longing to my father's sight. END
BEGIN NOW For him, a thousand dangers I have sought, END
BEGIN NOW And, rushing where the thickest Grecians fought, END
BEGIN NOW Safe on my back the sacred burthen brought. END
BEGIN NOW He, for my sake, the raging ocean tried, END
BEGIN NOW And wrath of Heav'n, my still auspicious guide, END
BEGIN NOW And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied. END
BEGIN NOW Oft, since he breath'd his last, in dead of night END
BEGIN NOW His reverend image stood before my sight; END
BEGIN NOW Enjoin'd to seek, below, his holy shade; END
BEGIN NOW Conducted there by your unerring aid. END
BEGIN NOW But you, if pious minds by pray'rs are won, END
BEGIN NOW Oblige the father, and protect the son. END
BEGIN NOW Yours is the pow'r; nor Proserpine in vain END
BEGIN NOW Has made you priestess of her nightly reign. END
BEGIN NOW If Orpheus, arm'd with his enchanting lyre, END
BEGIN NOW The ruthless king with pity could inspire, END
BEGIN NOW And from the shades below redeem his wife; END
BEGIN NOW If Pollux, off'ring his alternate life, END
BEGIN NOW Could free his brother, and can daily go END
BEGIN NOW By turns aloft, by turns descend below- END
BEGIN NOW Why name I Theseus, or his greater friend, END
BEGIN NOW Who trod the downward path, and upward could ascend? END
BEGIN NOW Not less than theirs from Jove my lineage came; END
BEGIN NOW My mother greater, my descent the same. END
BEGIN NOW So pray'd the Trojan prince, and, while he pray'd, END
BEGIN NOW His hand upon the holy altar laid. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus replied the prophetess divine: END
BEGIN NOW O goddess-born of great Anchises' line, END
BEGIN NOW The gates of hell are open night and day; END
BEGIN NOW Smooth the descent, and easy is the way: END
BEGIN NOW But to return, and view the cheerful skies, END
BEGIN NOW In this the task and mighty labor lies. END
BEGIN NOW To few great Jupiter imparts this grace, END
BEGIN NOW And those of shining worth and heav'nly race. END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt those regions and our upper light, END
BEGIN NOW Deep forests and impenetrable night END
BEGIN NOW Possess the middle space: th' infernal bounds END
BEGIN NOW Cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds. END
BEGIN NOW But if so dire a love your soul invades, END
BEGIN NOW As twice below to view the trembling shades; END
BEGIN NOW If you so hard a toil will undertake, END
BEGIN NOW As twice to pass th' innavigable lake; END
BEGIN NOW Receive my counsel. In the neighb'ring grove END
BEGIN NOW There stands a tree; the queen of Stygian Jove END
BEGIN NOW Claims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night END
BEGIN NOW Conceal the happy plant from human sight. END
BEGIN NOW One bough it bears; but (wondrous to behold!) END
BEGIN NOW The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold: END
BEGIN NOW This from the vulgar branches must be torn, END
BEGIN NOW And to fair Proserpine the present borne, END
BEGIN NOW Ere leave be giv'n to tempt the nether skies. END
BEGIN NOW The first thus rent a second will arise, END
BEGIN NOW And the same metal the same room supplies. END
BEGIN NOW Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see END
BEGIN NOW The lurking gold upon the fatal tree: END
BEGIN NOW Then rend it off, as holy rites command; END
BEGIN NOW The willing metal will obey thy hand, END
BEGIN NOW Following with ease, if favor'd by thy fate, END
BEGIN NOW Thou art foredoom'd to view the Stygian state: END
BEGIN NOW If not, no labor can the tree constrain; END
BEGIN NOW And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, you know not, while you here attend, END
BEGIN NOW Th' unworthy fate of your unhappy friend: END
BEGIN NOW Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost, END
BEGIN NOW Depriv'd of fun'ral rites, pollutes your host. END
BEGIN NOW Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead, END
BEGIN NOW Two sable sheep around his hearse be led; END
BEGIN NOW Then, living turfs upon his body lay: END
BEGIN NOW This done, securely take the destin'd way, END
BEGIN NOW To find the regions destitute of day. END
BEGIN NOW She said, and held her peace. Aeneas went END
BEGIN NOW Sad from the cave, and full of discontent, END
BEGIN NOW Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant. END
BEGIN NOW Achates, the companion of his breast, END
BEGIN NOW Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppress'd. END
BEGIN NOW Walking, they talk'd, and fruitlessly divin'd END
BEGIN NOW What friend the priestess by those words design'd. END
BEGIN NOW But soon they found an object to deplore: END
BEGIN NOW Misenus lay extended the shore; END
BEGIN NOW Son of the God of Winds: none so renown'd END
BEGIN NOW The warrior trumpet in the field to sound; END
BEGIN NOW With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms, END
BEGIN NOW And rouse to dare their fate in honorable arms. END
BEGIN NOW He serv'd great Hector, and was ever near, END
BEGIN NOW Not with his trumpet only, but his spear. END
BEGIN NOW But by Pelides' arms when Hector fell, END
BEGIN NOW He chose Aeneas; and he chose as well. END
BEGIN NOW Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more, END
BEGIN NOW He now provokes the sea gods from the shore; END
BEGIN NOW With envy Triton heard the martial sound, END
BEGIN NOW And the bold champion, for his challenge, drown'd; END
BEGIN NOW Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand: END
BEGIN NOW The gazing crowd around the body stand. END
BEGIN NOW All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate, END
BEGIN NOW And hastens to perform the funeral state. END
BEGIN NOW In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear; END
BEGIN NOW The basis broad below, and top advanc'd in air. END
BEGIN NOW An ancient wood, fit for the work design'd, END
BEGIN NOW (The shady covert of the salvage kind,) END
BEGIN NOW The Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied; END
BEGIN NOW Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow'ring pride END
BEGIN NOW Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke, END
BEGIN NOW And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak. END
BEGIN NOW Huge trunks of trees, fell'd from the steepy crown END
BEGIN NOW Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down. END
BEGIN NOW Arm'd like the rest the Trojan prince appears, END
BEGIN NOW And by his pious labor urges theirs. END
BEGIN NOW Thus while he wrought, revolving in his mind END
BEGIN NOW The ways to compass what his wish design'd, END
BEGIN NOW He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove, END
BEGIN NOW And then with vows implor'd the Queen of Love: END
BEGIN NOW O may thy pow'r, propitious still to me, END
BEGIN NOW Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree, END
BEGIN NOW In this deep forest; since the Sibyl's breath END
BEGIN NOW Foretold, alas! too true, Misenus' death. END
BEGIN NOW Scarce had he said, when, full before his sight, END
BEGIN NOW Two doves, descending from their airy flight, END
BEGIN NOW Secure upon the grassy plain alight. END
BEGIN NOW He knew his mother's birds; and thus he pray'd: END
BEGIN NOW Be you my guides, with your auspicious aid, END
BEGIN NOW And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found, END
BEGIN NOW Whose glitt'ring shadow gilds the sacred ground. END
BEGIN NOW And thou, great parent, with celestial care, END
BEGIN NOW In this distress be present to my pray'r! END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, he stopp'd with watchful sight, END
BEGIN NOW Observing still the motions of their flight, END
BEGIN NOW What course they took, what happy signs they shew. END
BEGIN NOW They fed, and, flutt'ring, by degrees withdrew END
BEGIN NOW Still farther from the place, but still in view: END
BEGIN NOW Hopping and flying, thus they led him on END
BEGIN NOW To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun END
BEGIN NOW They wing'd their flight aloft; then, stooping low, END
BEGIN NOW Perch'd on the double tree that bears the golden bough. END
BEGIN NOW Thro' the green leafs the glitt'ring shadows glow; END
BEGIN NOW As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe, END
BEGIN NOW Where the proud mother views her precious brood, END
BEGIN NOW And happier branches, which she never sow'd. END
BEGIN NOW Such was the glitt'ring; such the ruddy rind, END
BEGIN NOW And dancing leaves, that wanton'd in the wind. END
BEGIN NOW He seiz'd the shining bough with griping hold, END
BEGIN NOW And rent away, with ease, the ling'ring gold; END
BEGIN NOW Then to the Sibyl's palace bore the prize. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime the Trojan troops, with weeping eyes, END
BEGIN NOW To dead Misenus pay his obsequies. END
BEGIN NOW First, from the ground a lofty pile they rear, END
BEGIN NOW Of pitch trees, oaks, and pines, and unctuous fir: END
BEGIN NOW The fabric's front with cypress twigs they strew, END
BEGIN NOW And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew. END
BEGIN NOW The topmost part his glitt'ring arms adorn; END
BEGIN NOW Warm waters, then, in brazen caldrons borne, END
BEGIN NOW Are pour'd to wash his body, joint by joint, END
BEGIN NOW And fragrant oils the stiffen'd limbs anoint. END
BEGIN NOW With groans and cries Misenus they deplore: END
BEGIN NOW Then on a bier, with purple cover'd o'er, END
BEGIN NOW The breathless body, thus bewail'd, they lay, END
BEGIN NOW And fire the pile, their faces turn'd away- END
BEGIN NOW Such reverend rites their fathers us'd to pay. END
BEGIN NOW Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw, END
BEGIN NOW And fat of victims, which his friends bestow. END
BEGIN NOW These gifts the greedy flames to dust devour; END
BEGIN NOW Then on the living coals red wine they pour; END
BEGIN NOW And, last, the relics by themselves dispose, END
BEGIN NOW Which in a brazen urn the priests inclose. END
BEGIN NOW Old Corynaeus compass'd thrice the crew, END
BEGIN NOW And dipp'd an olive branch in holy dew; END
BEGIN NOW Which thrice he sprinkled round, and thrice aloud END
BEGIN NOW Invok'd the dead, and then dismissed the crowd. END
BEGIN NOW But good Aeneas order'd on the shore END
BEGIN NOW A stately tomb, whose top a trumpet bore, END
BEGIN NOW A soldier's fauchion, and a seaman's oar. END
BEGIN NOW Thus was his friend interr'd; and deathless fame END
BEGIN NOW Still to the lofty cape consigns his name. END
BEGIN NOW These rites perform'd, the prince, without delay, END
BEGIN NOW Hastes to the nether world his destin'd way. END
BEGIN NOW Deep was the cave; and, downward as it went END
BEGIN NOW From the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent; END
BEGIN NOW And here th' access a gloomy grove defends, END
BEGIN NOW And there th' unnavigable lake extends, END
BEGIN NOW O'er whose unhappy waters, void of light, END
BEGIN NOW No bird presumes to steer his airy flight; END
BEGIN NOW Such deadly stenches from the depths arise, END
BEGIN NOW And steaming sulphur, that infects the skies. END
BEGIN NOW From hence the Grecian bards their legends make, END
BEGIN NOW And give the name Avernus to the lake. END
BEGIN NOW Four sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught, END
BEGIN NOW For sacrifice the pious hero brought. END
BEGIN NOW The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns; END
BEGIN NOW Then cuts the curling hair; that first oblation burns, END
BEGIN NOW Invoking Hecate hither to repair: END
BEGIN NOW A pow'rful name in hell and upper air. END
BEGIN NOW The sacred priests with ready knives bereave END
BEGIN NOW The beasts of life, and in full bowls receive END
BEGIN NOW The streaming blood: a lamb to Hell and Night END
BEGIN NOW (The sable wool without a streak of white) END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas offers; and, by fate's decree, END
BEGIN NOW A barren heifer, Proserpine, to thee, END
BEGIN NOW With holocausts he Pluto's altar fills; END
BEGIN NOW Sev'n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills; END
BEGIN NOW Then on the broiling entrails oil he pours; END
BEGIN NOW Which, ointed thus, the raging flame devours. END
BEGIN NOW Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun, END
BEGIN NOW Nor ended till the next returning sun. END
BEGIN NOW Then earth began to bellow, trees to dance, END
BEGIN NOW And howling dogs in glimm'ring light advance, END
BEGIN NOW Ere Hecate came. "Far hence be souls profane! END
BEGIN NOW The Sibyl cried, "and from the grove abstain! END
BEGIN NOW Now, Trojan, take the way thy fates afford; END
BEGIN NOW Assume thy courage, and unsheathe thy sword. END
BEGIN NOW She said, and pass'd along the gloomy space; END
BEGIN NOW The prince pursued her steps with equal pace. END
BEGIN NOW Ye realms, yet unreveal'd to human sight, END
BEGIN NOW Ye gods who rule the regions of the night, END
BEGIN NOW Ye gliding ghosts, permit me to relate END
BEGIN NOW The mystic wonders of your silent state! END
BEGIN NOW Obscure they went thro' dreary shades, that led END
BEGIN NOW Along the waste dominions of the dead. END
BEGIN NOW Thus wander travelers in woods by night, END
BEGIN NOW By the moon's doubtful and malignant light, END
BEGIN NOW When Jove in dusky clouds involves the skies, END
BEGIN NOW And the faint crescent shoots by fits before their eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Just in the gate and in the jaws of hell, END
BEGIN NOW Revengeful Cares and sullen Sorrows dwell, END
BEGIN NOW And pale Diseases, and repining Age, END
BEGIN NOW Want, Fear, and Famine's unresisted rage; END
BEGIN NOW Here Toils, and Death, and Death's half-brother, Sleep, END
BEGIN NOW Forms terrible to view, their sentry keep; END
BEGIN NOW With anxious Pleasures of a guilty mind, END
BEGIN NOW Deep Frauds before, and open Force behind; END
BEGIN NOW The Furies' iron beds; and Strife, that shakes END
BEGIN NOW Her hissing tresses and unfolds her snakes. END
BEGIN NOW Full in the midst of this infernal road, END
BEGIN NOW An elm displays her dusky arms abroad: END
BEGIN NOW The God of Sleep there hides his heavy head, END
BEGIN NOW And empty dreams on ev'ry leaf are spread. END
BEGIN NOW Of various forms unnumber'd specters more, END
BEGIN NOW Centaurs, and double shapes, besiege the door. END
BEGIN NOW Before the passage, horrid Hydra stands, END
BEGIN NOW And Briareus with all his hundred hands; END
BEGIN NOW Gorgons, Geryon with his triple frame; END
BEGIN NOW And vain Chimaera vomits empty flame. END
BEGIN NOW The chief unsheath'd his shining steel, prepar'd, END
BEGIN NOW Tho' seiz'd with sudden fear, to force the guard, END
BEGIN NOW Off'ring his brandish'd weapon at their face; END
BEGIN NOW Had not the Sibyl stopp'd his eager pace, END
BEGIN NOW And told him what those empty phantoms were: END
BEGIN NOW Forms without bodies, and impassive air. END
BEGIN NOW Hence to deep Acheron they take their way, END
BEGIN NOW Whose troubled eddies, thick with ooze and clay, END
BEGIN NOW Are whirl'd aloft, and in Cocytus lost. END
BEGIN NOW There Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast- END
BEGIN NOW A sordid god: down from his hoary chin END
BEGIN NOW A length of beard descends, uncomb'd, unclean; END
BEGIN NOW His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire; END
BEGIN NOW A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire. END
BEGIN NOW He spreads his canvas; with his pole he steers; END
BEGIN NOW The freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears. END
BEGIN NOW He look'd in years; yet in his years were seen END
BEGIN NOW A youthful vigor and autumnal green. END
BEGIN NOW An airy crowd came rushing where he stood, END
BEGIN NOW Which fill'd the margin of the fatal flood: END
BEGIN NOW Husbands and wives, boys and unmarried maids, END
BEGIN NOW And mighty heroes' more majestic shades, END
BEGIN NOW And youths, intomb'd before their fathers' eyes, END
BEGIN NOW With hollow groans, and shrieks, and feeble cries. END
BEGIN NOW Thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods, END
BEGIN NOW Or fowls, by winter forc'd, forsake the floods, END
BEGIN NOW And wing their hasty flight to happier lands; END
BEGIN NOW Such, and so thick, the shiv'ring army stands, END
BEGIN NOW And press for passage with extended hands. END
BEGIN NOW Now these, now those, the surly boatman bore: END
BEGIN NOW The rest he drove to distance from the shore. END
BEGIN NOW The hero, who beheld with wond'ring eyes END
BEGIN NOW The tumult mix'd with shrieks, laments, and cries, END
BEGIN NOW Ask'd of his guide, what the rude concourse meant; END
BEGIN NOW Why to the shore the thronging people bent; END
BEGIN NOW What forms of law among the ghosts were us'd; END
BEGIN NOW Why some were ferried o'er, and some refus'd. END
BEGIN NOW Son of Anchises, offspring of the gods, END
BEGIN NOW The Sibyl said, "you see the Stygian floods, END
BEGIN NOW The sacred stream which heav'n's imperial state END
BEGIN NOW Attests in oaths, and fears to violate. END
BEGIN NOW The ghosts rejected are th' unhappy crew END
BEGIN NOW Depriv'd of sepulchers and fun'ral due: END
BEGIN NOW The boatman, Charon; those, the buried host, END
BEGIN NOW He ferries over to the farther coast; END
BEGIN NOW Nor dares his transport vessel cross the waves END
BEGIN NOW With such whose bones are not compos'd in graves. END
BEGIN NOW A hundred years they wander on the shore; END
BEGIN NOW At length, their penance done, are wafted o'er. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan chief his forward pace repress'd, END
BEGIN NOW Revolving anxious thoughts within his breast, END
BEGIN NOW He saw his friends, who, whelm'd beneath the waves, END
BEGIN NOW Their fun'ral honors claim'd, and ask'd their quiet graves. END
BEGIN NOW The lost Leucaspis in the crowd he knew, END
BEGIN NOW And the brave leader of the Lycian crew, END
BEGIN NOW Whom, on the Tyrrhene seas, the tempests met; END
BEGIN NOW The sailors master'd, and the ship o'erset. END
BEGIN NOW Amidst the spirits, Palinurus press'd, END
BEGIN NOW Yet fresh from life, a new-admitted guest, END
BEGIN NOW Who, while he steering view'd the stars, and bore END
BEGIN NOW His course from Afric to the Latian shore, END
BEGIN NOW Fell headlong down. The Trojan fix'd his view, END
BEGIN NOW And scarcely thro' the gloom the sullen shadow knew. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus the prince: "What envious pow'r, O friend, END
BEGIN NOW Brought your lov'd life to this disastrous end? END
BEGIN NOW For Phoebus, ever true in all he said, END
BEGIN NOW Has in your fate alone my faith betray'd. END
BEGIN NOW The god foretold you should not die, before END
BEGIN NOW You reach'd, secure from seas, th' Italian shore. END
BEGIN NOW Is this th' unerring pow'r?" The ghost replied; END
BEGIN NOW Nor Phoebus flatter'd, nor his answers lied; END
BEGIN NOW Nor envious gods have sent me to the deep: END
BEGIN NOW But, while the stars and course of heav'n I keep, END
BEGIN NOW My wearied eyes were seiz'd with fatal sleep. END
BEGIN NOW I fell; and, with my weight, the helm constrain'd END
BEGIN NOW Was drawn along, which yet my gripe retain'd. END
BEGIN NOW Now by the winds and raging waves I swear, END
BEGIN NOW Your safety, more than mine, was then my care; END
BEGIN NOW Lest, of the guide bereft, the rudder lost, END
BEGIN NOW Your ship should run against the rocky coast. END
BEGIN NOW Three blust'ring nights, borne by the southern blast, END
BEGIN NOW I floated, and discover'd land at last: END
BEGIN NOW High on a mounting wave my head I bore, END
BEGIN NOW Forcing my strength, and gath'ring to the shore. END
BEGIN NOW Panting, but past the danger, now I seiz'd END
BEGIN NOW The craggy cliffs, and my tir'd members eas'd. END
BEGIN NOW While, cumber'd with my dropping clothes, I lay, END
BEGIN NOW The cruel nation, covetous of prey, END
BEGIN NOW Stain'd with my blood th' unhospitable coast; END
BEGIN NOW And now, by winds and waves, my lifeless limbs are toss'd: END
BEGIN NOW Which O avert, by yon ethereal light, END
BEGIN NOW Which I have lost for this eternal night! END
BEGIN NOW Or, if by dearer ties you may be won, END
BEGIN NOW By your dead sire, and by your living son, END
BEGIN NOW Redeem from this reproach my wand'ring ghost; END
BEGIN NOW Or with your navy seek the Velin coast, END
BEGIN NOW And in a peaceful grave my corpse compose; END
BEGIN NOW Or, if a nearer way your mother shows, END
BEGIN NOW Without whose aid you durst not undertake END
BEGIN NOW This frightful passage o'er the Stygian lake, END
BEGIN NOW Lend to this wretch your hand, and waft him o'er END
BEGIN NOW To the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore. END
BEGIN NOW Scarce had he said, the prophetess began: END
BEGIN NOW What hopes delude thee, miserable man? END
BEGIN NOW Think'st thou, thus unintomb'd, to cross the floods, END
BEGIN NOW To view the Furies and infernal gods, END
BEGIN NOW And visit, without leave, the dark abodes? END
BEGIN NOW Attend the term of long revolving years; END
BEGIN NOW Fate, and the dooming gods, are deaf to tears. END
BEGIN NOW This comfort of thy dire misfortune take: END
BEGIN NOW The wrath of Heav'n, inflicted for thy sake, END
BEGIN NOW With vengeance shall pursue th' inhuman coast, END
BEGIN NOW Till they propitiate thy offended ghost, END
BEGIN NOW And raise a tomb, with vows and solemn pray'r; END
BEGIN NOW And Palinurus' name the place shall bear. END
BEGIN NOW This calm'd his cares; sooth'd with his future fame, END
BEGIN NOW And pleas'd to hear his propagated name. END
BEGIN NOW Now nearer to the Stygian lake they draw: END
BEGIN NOW Whom, from the shore, the surly boatman saw; END
BEGIN NOW Observ'd their passage thro' the shady wood, END
BEGIN NOW And mark'd their near approaches to the flood. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus he call'd aloud, inflam'd with wrath: END
BEGIN NOW Mortal, whate'er, who this forbidden path END
BEGIN NOW In arms presum'st to tread, I charge thee, stand, END
BEGIN NOW And tell thy name, and bus'ness in the land. END
BEGIN NOW Know this, the realm of night- the Stygian shore: END
BEGIN NOW My boat conveys no living bodies o'er; END
BEGIN NOW Nor was I pleas'd great Theseus once to bear, END
BEGIN NOW Who forc'd a passage with his pointed spear, END
BEGIN NOW Nor strong Alcides- men of mighty fame, END
BEGIN NOW And from th' immortal gods their lineage came. END
BEGIN NOW In fetters one the barking porter tied, END
BEGIN NOW And took him trembling from his sov'reign's side: END
BEGIN NOW Two sought by force to seize his beauteous bride. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the Sibyl thus: "Compose thy mind; END
BEGIN NOW Nor frauds are here contriv'd, nor force design'd. END
BEGIN NOW Still may the dog the wand'ring troops constrain END
BEGIN NOW Of airy ghosts, and vex the guilty train, END
BEGIN NOW And with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan chief, whose lineage is from Jove, END
BEGIN NOW Much fam'd for arms, and more for filial love, END
BEGIN NOW Is sent to seek his sire in your Elysian grove. END
BEGIN NOW If neither piety, nor Heav'n's command, END
BEGIN NOW Can gain his passage to the Stygian strand, END
BEGIN NOW This fatal present shall prevail at least. END
BEGIN NOW Then shew'd the shining bough, conceal'd within her vest. END
BEGIN NOW No more was needful: for the gloomy god END
BEGIN NOW Stood mute with awe, to see the golden rod; END
BEGIN NOW Admir'd the destin'd off'ring to his queen- END
BEGIN NOW A venerable gift, so rarely seen. END
BEGIN NOW His fury thus appeas'd, he puts to land; END
BEGIN NOW The ghosts forsake their seats at his command: END
BEGIN NOW He clears the deck, receives the mighty freight; END
BEGIN NOW The leaky vessel groans beneath the weight. END
BEGIN NOW Slowly she sails, and scarcely stems the tides; END
BEGIN NOW The pressing water pours within her sides. END
BEGIN NOW His passengers at length are wafted o'er, END
BEGIN NOW Expos'd, in muddy weeds, upon the miry shore. END
BEGIN NOW No sooner landed, in his den they found END
BEGIN NOW The triple porter of the Stygian sound, END
BEGIN NOW Grim Cerberus, who soon began to rear END
BEGIN NOW His crested snakes, and arm'd his bristling hair. END
BEGIN NOW The prudent Sibyl had before prepar'd END
BEGIN NOW A sop, in honey steep'd, to charm the guard; END
BEGIN NOW Which, mix'd with pow'rful drugs, she cast before END
BEGIN NOW His greedy grinning jaws, just op'd to roar. END
BEGIN NOW With three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight, END
BEGIN NOW With hunger press'd, devours the pleasing bait. END
BEGIN NOW Long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave; END
BEGIN NOW He reels, and, falling, fills the spacious cave. END
BEGIN NOW The keeper charm'd, the chief without delay END
BEGIN NOW Pass'd on, and took th' irremeable way. END
BEGIN NOW Before the gates, the cries of babes new born, END
BEGIN NOW Whom fate had from their tender mothers torn, END
BEGIN NOW Assault his ears: then those, whom form of laws END
BEGIN NOW Condemn'd to die, when traitors judg'd their cause. END
BEGIN NOW Nor want they lots, nor judges to review END
BEGIN NOW The wrongful sentence, and award a new. END
BEGIN NOW Minos, the strict inquisitor, appears; END
BEGIN NOW And lives and crimes, with his assessors, hears. END
BEGIN NOW Round in his urn the blended balls he rolls, END
BEGIN NOW Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls. END
BEGIN NOW The next, in place and punishment, are they END
BEGIN NOW Who prodigally throw their souls away; END
BEGIN NOW Fools, who, repining at their wretched state, END
BEGIN NOW And loathing anxious life, suborn'd their fate. END
BEGIN NOW With late repentance now they would retrieve END
BEGIN NOW The bodies they forsook, and wish to live; END
BEGIN NOW Their pains and poverty desire to bear, END
BEGIN NOW To view the light of heav'n, and breathe the vital air: END
BEGIN NOW But fate forbids; the Stygian floods oppose, END
BEGIN NOW And with circling streams the captive souls inclose. END
BEGIN NOW Not far from thence, the Mournful Fields appear END
BEGIN NOW So call'd from lovers that inhabit there. END
BEGIN NOW The souls whom that unhappy flame invades, END
BEGIN NOW In secret solitude and myrtle shades END
BEGIN NOW Make endless moans, and, pining with desire, END
BEGIN NOW Lament too late their unextinguish'd fire. END
BEGIN NOW Here Procris, Eriphyle here he found, END
BEGIN NOW Baring her breast, yet bleeding with the wound END
BEGIN NOW Made by her son. He saw Pasiphae there, END
BEGIN NOW With Phaedra's ghost, a foul incestuous pair. END
BEGIN NOW There Laodamia, with Evadne, moves, END
BEGIN NOW Unhappy both, but loyal in their loves: END
BEGIN NOW Caeneus, a woman once, and once a man, END
BEGIN NOW But ending in the sex she first began. END
BEGIN NOW Not far from these Phoenician Dido stood, END
BEGIN NOW Fresh from her wound, her bosom bath'd in blood; END
BEGIN NOW Whom when the Trojan hero hardly knew, END
BEGIN NOW Obscure in shades, and with a doubtful view, END
BEGIN NOW (Doubtful as he who sees, thro' dusky night, END
BEGIN NOW Or thinks he sees, the moon's uncertain light,) END
BEGIN NOW With tears he first approach'd the sullen shade; END
BEGIN NOW And, as his love inspir'd him, thus he said: END
BEGIN NOW Unhappy queen! then is the common breath END
BEGIN NOW Of rumor true, in your reported death, END
BEGIN NOW And I, alas! the cause? By Heav'n, I vow, END
BEGIN NOW And all the pow'rs that rule the realms below, END
BEGIN NOW Unwilling I forsook your friendly state, END
BEGIN NOW Commanded by the gods, and forc'd by fate- END
BEGIN NOW Those gods, that fate, whose unresisted might END
BEGIN NOW Have sent me to these regions void of light, END
BEGIN NOW Thro' the vast empire of eternal night. END
BEGIN NOW Nor dar'd I to presume, that, press'd with grief, END
BEGIN NOW My flight should urge you to this dire relief. END
BEGIN NOW Stay, stay your steps, and listen to my vows: END
BEGIN NOW 'T is the last interview that fate allows! END
BEGIN NOW In vain he thus attempts her mind to move END
BEGIN NOW With tears, and pray'rs, and late-repenting love. END
BEGIN NOW Disdainfully she look'd; then turning round, END
BEGIN NOW But fix'd her eyes unmov'd upon the ground, END
BEGIN NOW And what he says and swears, regards no more END
BEGIN NOW Than the deaf rocks, when the loud billows roar; END
BEGIN NOW But whirl'd away, to shun his hateful sight, END
BEGIN NOW Hid in the forest and the shades of night; END
BEGIN NOW Then sought Sichaeus thro' the shady grove, END
BEGIN NOW Who answer'd all her cares, and equal'd all her love. END
BEGIN NOW Some pious tears the pitying hero paid, END
BEGIN NOW And follow'd with his eyes the flitting shade, END
BEGIN NOW Then took the forward way, by fate ordain'd, END
BEGIN NOW And, with his guide, the farther fields attain'd, END
BEGIN NOW Where, sever'd from the rest, the warrior souls remain'd. END
BEGIN NOW Tydeus he met, with Meleager's race, END
BEGIN NOW The pride of armies, and the soldiers' grace; END
BEGIN NOW And pale Adrastus with his ghastly face. END
BEGIN NOW Of Trojan chiefs he view'd a num'rous train, END
BEGIN NOW All much lamented, all in battle slain; END
BEGIN NOW Glaucus and Medon, high above the rest, END
BEGIN NOW Antenor's sons, and Ceres' sacred priest. END
BEGIN NOW And proud Idaeus, Priam's charioteer, END
BEGIN NOW Who shakes his empty reins, and aims his airy spear. END
BEGIN NOW The gladsome ghosts, in circling troops, attend END
BEGIN NOW And with unwearied eyes behold their friend; END
BEGIN NOW Delight to hover near, and long to know END
BEGIN NOW What bus'ness brought him to the realms below. END
BEGIN NOW But Argive chiefs, and Agamemnon's train, END
BEGIN NOW When his refulgent arms flash'd thro' the shady plain, END
BEGIN NOW Fled from his well-known face, with wonted fear, END
BEGIN NOW As when his thund'ring sword and pointed spear END
BEGIN NOW Drove headlong to their ships, and glean'd the routed rear. END
BEGIN NOW They rais'd a feeble cry, with trembling notes; END
BEGIN NOW But the weak voice deceiv'd their gasping throats. END
BEGIN NOW Here Priam's son, Deiphobus, he found, END
BEGIN NOW Whose face and limbs were one continued wound: END
BEGIN NOW Dishonest, with lopp'd arms, the youth appears, END
BEGIN NOW Spoil'd of his nose, and shorten'd of his ears. END
BEGIN NOW He scarcely knew him, striving to disown END
BEGIN NOW His blotted form, and blushing to be known; END
BEGIN NOW And therefore first began: "O Tsucer's race, END
BEGIN NOW Who durst thy faultless figure thus deface? END
BEGIN NOW What heart could wish, what hand inflict, this dire disgrace? END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas fam'd, that in our last and fatal night END
BEGIN NOW Your single prowess long sustain'd the fight, END
BEGIN NOW Till tir'd, not forc'd, a glorious fate you chose, END
BEGIN NOW And fell upon a heap of slaughter'd foes. END
BEGIN NOW But, in remembrance of so brave a deed, END
BEGIN NOW A tomb and fun'ral honors I decreed; END
BEGIN NOW Thrice call'd your manes on the Trojan plains: END
BEGIN NOW The place your armor and your name retains. END
BEGIN NOW Your body too I sought, and, had I found, END
BEGIN NOW Design'd for burial in your native ground. END
BEGIN NOW The ghost replied: "Your piety has paid END
BEGIN NOW All needful rites, to rest my wand'ring shade; END
BEGIN NOW But cruel fate, and my more cruel wife, END
BEGIN NOW To Grecian swords betray'd my sleeping life. END
BEGIN NOW These are the monuments of Helen's love: END
BEGIN NOW The shame I bear below, the marks I bore above. END
BEGIN NOW You know in what deluding joys we pass'd END
BEGIN NOW The night that was by Heav'n decreed our last: END
BEGIN NOW For, when the fatal horse, descending down, END
BEGIN NOW Pregnant with arms, o'erwhelm'd th' unhappy town END
BEGIN NOW She feign'd nocturnal orgies; left my bed, END
BEGIN NOW And, mix'd with Trojan dames, the dances led END
BEGIN NOW Then, waving high her torch, the signal made, END
BEGIN NOW Which rous'd the Grecians from their ambuscade. END
BEGIN NOW With watching overworn, with cares oppress'd, END
BEGIN NOW Unhappy I had laid me down to rest, END
BEGIN NOW And heavy sleep my weary limbs possess'd. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid, END
BEGIN NOW And from beneath my head my sword convey'd; END
BEGIN NOW The door unlatch'd, and, with repeated calls, END
BEGIN NOW Invites her former lord within my walls. END
BEGIN NOW Thus in her crime her confidence she plac'd, END
BEGIN NOW And with new treasons would redeem the past. END
BEGIN NOW What need I more? Into the room they ran, END
BEGIN NOW And meanly murther'd a defenseless man. END
BEGIN NOW Ulysses, basely born, first led the way. END
BEGIN NOW Avenging pow'rs! with justice if I pray, END
BEGIN NOW That fortune be their own another day! END
BEGIN NOW But answer you; and in your turn relate, END
BEGIN NOW What brought you, living, to the Stygian state: END
BEGIN NOW Driv'n by the winds and errors of the sea, END
BEGIN NOW Or did you Heav'n's superior doom obey? END
BEGIN NOW Or tell what other chance conducts your way, END
BEGIN NOW To view with mortal eyes our dark retreats, END
BEGIN NOW Tumults and torments of th' infernal seats. END
BEGIN NOW While thus in talk the flying hours they pass, END
BEGIN NOW The sun had finish'd more than half his race: END
BEGIN NOW And they, perhaps, in words and tears had spent END
BEGIN NOW The little time of stay which Heav'n had lent; END
BEGIN NOW But thus the Sibyl chides their long delay: END
BEGIN NOW Night rushes down, and headlong drives the day: END
BEGIN NOW 'T is here, in different paths, the way divides; END
BEGIN NOW The right to Pluto's golden palace guides; END
BEGIN NOW The left to that unhappy region tends, END
BEGIN NOW Which to the depth of Tartarus descends; END
BEGIN NOW The seat of night profound, and punish'd fiends. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus Deiphobus: "O sacred maid, END
BEGIN NOW Forbear to chide, and be your will obey'd! END
BEGIN NOW Lo! to the secret shadows I retire, END
BEGIN NOW To pay my penance till my years expire. END
BEGIN NOW Proceed, auspicious prince, with glory crown'd, END
BEGIN NOW And born to better fates than I have found. END
BEGIN NOW He said; and, while he said, his steps he turn'd END
BEGIN NOW To secret shadows, and in silence mourn'd. END
BEGIN NOW The hero, looking on the left, espied END
BEGIN NOW A lofty tow'r, and strong on ev'ry side END
BEGIN NOW With treble walls, which Phlegethon surrounds, END
BEGIN NOW Whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds; END
BEGIN NOW And, press'd betwixt the rocks, the bellowing noise resounds END
BEGIN NOW Wide is the fronting gate, and, rais'd on high END
BEGIN NOW With adamantine columns, threats the sky. END
BEGIN NOW Vain is the force of man, and Heav'n's as vain, END
BEGIN NOW To crush the pillars which the pile sustain. END
BEGIN NOW Sublime on these a tow'r of steel is rear'd; END
BEGIN NOW And dire Tisiphone there keeps the ward, END
BEGIN NOW Girt in her sanguine gown, by night and day, END
BEGIN NOW Observant of the souls that pass the downward way. END
BEGIN NOW From hence are heard the groans of ghosts, the pains END
BEGIN NOW Of sounding lashes and of dragging chains. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan stood astonish'd at their cries, END
BEGIN NOW And ask'd his guide from whence those yells arise; END
BEGIN NOW And what the crimes, and what the tortures were, END
BEGIN NOW And loud laments that rent the liquid air. END
BEGIN NOW She thus replied: "The chaste and holy race END
BEGIN NOW Are all forbidden this polluted place. END
BEGIN NOW But Hecate, when she gave to rule the woods, END
BEGIN NOW Then led me trembling thro' these dire abodes, END
BEGIN NOW And taught the tortures of th' avenging gods. END
BEGIN NOW These are the realms of unrelenting fate; END
BEGIN NOW And awful Rhadamanthus rules the state. END
BEGIN NOW He hears and judges each committed crime; END
BEGIN NOW Enquires into the manner, place, and time. END
BEGIN NOW The conscious wretch must all his acts reveal, END
BEGIN NOW (Loth to confess, unable to conceal), END
BEGIN NOW From the first moment of his vital breath, END
BEGIN NOW To his last hour of unrepenting death. END
BEGIN NOW Straight, o'er the guilty ghost, the Fury shakes END
BEGIN NOW The sounding whip and brandishes her snakes, END
BEGIN NOW And the pale sinner, with her sisters, takes. END
BEGIN NOW Then, of itself, unfolds th' eternal door; END
BEGIN NOW With dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar. END
BEGIN NOW You see, before the gate, what stalking ghost END
BEGIN NOW Commands the guard, what sentries keep the post. END
BEGIN NOW More formidable Hydra stands within, END
BEGIN NOW Whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin. END
BEGIN NOW The gaping gulf low to the center lies, END
BEGIN NOW And twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies. END
BEGIN NOW The rivals of the gods, the Titan race, END
BEGIN NOW Here, sing'd with lightning, roll within th' unfathom'd space. END
BEGIN NOW Here lie th' Alaean twins, (I saw them both,) END
BEGIN NOW Enormous bodies, of gigantic growth, END
BEGIN NOW Who dar'd in fight the Thund'rer to defy, END
BEGIN NOW Affect his heav'n, and force him from the sky. END
BEGIN NOW Salmoneus, suff'ring cruel pains, I found, END
BEGIN NOW For emulating Jove; the rattling sound END
BEGIN NOW Of mimic thunder, and the glitt'ring blaze END
BEGIN NOW Of pointed lightnings, and their forky rays. END
BEGIN NOW Thro' Elis and the Grecian towns he flew; END
BEGIN NOW Th' audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew: END
BEGIN NOW He wav'd a torch aloft, and, madly vain, END
BEGIN NOW Sought godlike worship from a servile train. END
BEGIN NOW Ambitious fool! with horny hoofs to pass END
BEGIN NOW O'er hollow arches of resounding brass, END
BEGIN NOW To rival thunder in its rapid course, END
BEGIN NOW And imitate inimitable force! END
BEGIN NOW But he, the King of Heav'n, obscure on high, END
BEGIN NOW Bar'd his red arm, and, launching from the sky END
BEGIN NOW His writhen bolt, not shaking empty smoke, END
BEGIN NOW Down to the deep abyss the flaming felon strook. END
BEGIN NOW There Tityus was to see, who took his birth END
BEGIN NOW From heav'n, his nursing from the foodful earth. END
BEGIN NOW Here his gigantic limbs, with large embrace, END
BEGIN NOW Infold nine acres of infernal space. END
BEGIN NOW A rav'nous vulture, in his open'd side, END
BEGIN NOW Her crooked beak and cruel talons tried; END
BEGIN NOW Still for the growing liver digg'd his breast; END
BEGIN NOW The growing liver still supplied the feast; END
BEGIN NOW Still are his entrails fruitful to their pains: END
BEGIN NOW Th' immortal hunger lasts, th' immortal food remains. END
BEGIN NOW Ixion and Perithous I could name, END
BEGIN NOW And more Thessalian chiefs of mighty fame. END
BEGIN NOW High o'er their heads a mold'ring rock is plac'd, END
BEGIN NOW That promises a fall, and shakes at ev'ry blast. END
BEGIN NOW They lie below, on golden beds display'd; END
BEGIN NOW And genial feasts with regal pomp are made. END
BEGIN NOW The Queen of Furies by their sides is set, END
BEGIN NOW And snatches from their mouths th' untasted meat, END
BEGIN NOW Which if they touch, her hissing snakes she rears, END
BEGIN NOW Tossing her torch, and thund'ring in their ears. END
BEGIN NOW Then they, who brothers' better claim disown, END
BEGIN NOW Expel their parents, and usurp the throne; END
BEGIN NOW Defraud their clients, and, to lucre sold, END
BEGIN NOW Sit brooding on unprofitable gold; END
BEGIN NOW Who dare not give, and ev'n refuse to lend END
BEGIN NOW To their poor kindred, or a wanting friend. END
BEGIN NOW Vast is the throng of these; nor less the train END
BEGIN NOW Of lustful youths, for foul adult'ry slain: END
BEGIN NOW Hosts of deserters, who their honor sold, END
BEGIN NOW And basely broke their faith for bribes of gold. END
BEGIN NOW All these within the dungeon's depth remain, END
BEGIN NOW Despairing pardon, and expecting pain. END
BEGIN NOW Ask not what pains; nor farther seek to know END
BEGIN NOW Their process, or the forms of law below. END
BEGIN NOW Some roll a weighty stone; some, laid along, END
BEGIN NOW And bound with burning wires, on spokes of wheels are hung END
BEGIN NOW Unhappy Theseus, doom'd for ever there, END
BEGIN NOW Is fix'd by fate on his eternal chair; END
BEGIN NOW And wretched Phlegyas warns the world with cries END
BEGIN NOW (Could warning make the world more just or wise): END
BEGIN NOW 'Learn righteousness, and dread th' avenging deities.' END
BEGIN NOW To tyrants others have their country sold, END
BEGIN NOW Imposing foreign lords, for foreign gold; END
BEGIN NOW Some have old laws repeal'd, new statutes made, END
BEGIN NOW Not as the people pleas'd, but as they paid; END
BEGIN NOW With incest some their daughters' bed profan'd: END
BEGIN NOW All dar'd the worst of ills, and, what they dar'd, attain'd. END
BEGIN NOW Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues, END
BEGIN NOW And throats of brass, inspir'd with iron lungs, END
BEGIN NOW I could not half those horrid crimes repeat, END
BEGIN NOW Nor half the punishments those crimes have met. END
BEGIN NOW But let us haste our voyage to pursue: END
BEGIN NOW The walls of Pluto's palace are in view; END
BEGIN NOW The gate, and iron arch above it, stands END
BEGIN NOW On anvils labor'd by the Cyclops' hands. END
BEGIN NOW Before our farther way the Fates allow, END
BEGIN NOW Here must we fix on high the golden bough. END
BEGIN NOW She said: and thro' the gloomy shades they pass'd, END
BEGIN NOW And chose the middle path. Arriv'd at last, END
BEGIN NOW The prince with living water sprinkled o'er END
BEGIN NOW His limbs and body; then approach'd the door, END
BEGIN NOW Possess'd the porch, and on the front above END
BEGIN NOW He fix'd the fatal bough requir'd by Pluto's love. END
BEGIN NOW These holy rites perform'd, they took their way END
BEGIN NOW Where long extended plains of pleasure lay: END
BEGIN NOW The verdant fields with those of heav'n may vie, END
BEGIN NOW With ether vested, and a purple sky; END
BEGIN NOW The blissful seats of happy souls below. END
BEGIN NOW Stars of their own, and their own suns, they know; END
BEGIN NOW Their airy limbs in sports they exercise, END
BEGIN NOW And on the green contend the wrestler's prize. END
BEGIN NOW Some in heroic verse divinely sing; END
BEGIN NOW Others in artful measures led the ring. END
BEGIN NOW The Thracian bard, surrounded by the rest, END
BEGIN NOW There stands conspicuous in his flowing vest; END
BEGIN NOW His flying fingers, and harmonious quill, END
BEGIN NOW Strikes sev'n distinguish'd notes, and sev'n at once they fill. END
BEGIN NOW Here found they Tsucer's old heroic race, END
BEGIN NOW Born better times and happier years to grace. END
BEGIN NOW Assaracus and Ilus here enjoy END
BEGIN NOW Perpetual fame, with him who founded Troy. END
BEGIN NOW The chief beheld their chariots from afar, END
BEGIN NOW Their shining arms, and coursers train'd to war: END
BEGIN NOW Their lances fix'd in earth, their steeds around, END
BEGIN NOW Free from their harness, graze the flow'ry ground. END
BEGIN NOW The love of horses which they had, alive, END
BEGIN NOW And care of chariots, after death survive. END
BEGIN NOW Some cheerful souls were feasting on the plain; END
BEGIN NOW Some did the song, and some the choir maintain, END
BEGIN NOW Beneath a laurel shade, where mighty Po END
BEGIN NOW Mounts up to woods above, and hides his head below. END
BEGIN NOW Here patriots live, who, for their country's good, END
BEGIN NOW In fighting fields, were prodigal of blood: END
BEGIN NOW Priests of unblemish'd lives here make abode, END
BEGIN NOW And poets worthy their inspiring god; END
BEGIN NOW And searching wits, of more mechanic parts, END
BEGIN NOW Who grac'd their age with new-invented arts: END
BEGIN NOW Those who to worth their bounty did extend, END
BEGIN NOW And those who knew that bounty to commend. END
BEGIN NOW The heads of these with holy fillets bound, END
BEGIN NOW And all their temples were with garlands crown'd. END
BEGIN NOW To these the Sibyl thus her speech address'd, END
BEGIN NOW And first to him surrounded by the rest END
BEGIN NOW (Tow'ring his height, and ample was his breast): END
BEGIN NOW Say, happy souls, divine Musaeus, say, END
BEGIN NOW Where lives Anchises, and where lies our way END
BEGIN NOW To find the hero, for whose only sake END
BEGIN NOW We sought the dark abodes, and cross'd the bitter lake? END
BEGIN NOW To this the sacred poet thus replied: END
BEGIN NOW In no fix'd place the happy souls reside. END
BEGIN NOW In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds, END
BEGIN NOW By crystal streams, that murmur thro' the meads: END
BEGIN NOW But pass yon easy hill, and thence descend; END
BEGIN NOW The path conducts you to your journey's end. END
BEGIN NOW This said, he led them up the mountain's brow, END
BEGIN NOW And shews them all the shining fields below. END
BEGIN NOW They wind the hill, and thro' the blissful meadows go. END
BEGIN NOW But old Anchises, in a flow'ry vale, END
BEGIN NOW Review'd his muster'd race, and took the tale: END
BEGIN NOW Those happy spirits, which, ordain'd by fate, END
BEGIN NOW For future beings and new bodies wait- END
BEGIN NOW With studious thought observ'd th' illustrious throng, END
BEGIN NOW In nature's order as they pass'd along: END
BEGIN NOW Their names, their fates, their conduct, and their care, END
BEGIN NOW In peaceful senates and successful war. END
BEGIN NOW He, when Aeneas on the plain appears, END
BEGIN NOW Meets him with open arms, and falling tears. END
BEGIN NOW Welcome, he said, "the gods' undoubted race! END
BEGIN NOW O long expected to my dear embrace! END
BEGIN NOW Once more 't is giv'n me to behold your face! END
BEGIN NOW The love and pious duty which you pay END
BEGIN NOW Have pass'd the perils of so hard a way. END
BEGIN NOW 'T is true, computing times, I now believ'd END
BEGIN NOW The happy day approach'd; nor are my hopes deceiv'd. END
BEGIN NOW What length of lands, what oceans have you pass'd; END
BEGIN NOW What storms sustain'd, and on what shores been cast? END
BEGIN NOW How have I fear'd your fate! but fear'd it most, END
BEGIN NOW When love assail'd you, on the Libyan coast. END
BEGIN NOW To this, the filial duty thus replies: END
BEGIN NOW Your sacred ghost before my sleeping eyes END
BEGIN NOW Appear'd, and often urg'd this painful enterprise. END
BEGIN NOW After long tossing on the Tyrrhene sea, END
BEGIN NOW My navy rides at anchor in the bay. END
BEGIN NOW But reach your hand, O parent shade, nor shun END
BEGIN NOW The dear embraces of your longing son! END
BEGIN NOW He said; and falling tears his face bedew: END
BEGIN NOW Then thrice around his neck his arms he threw; END
BEGIN NOW And thrice the flitting shadow slipp'd away, END
BEGIN NOW Like winds, or empty dreams that fly the day. END
BEGIN NOW Now, in a secret vale, the Trojan sees END
BEGIN NOW A sep'rate grove, thro' which a gentle breeze END
BEGIN NOW Plays with a passing breath, and whispers thro' the trees; END
BEGIN NOW And, just before the confines of the wood, END
BEGIN NOW The gliding Lethe leads her silent flood. END
BEGIN NOW About the boughs an airy nation flew, END
BEGIN NOW Thick as the humming bees, that hunt the golden dew; END
BEGIN NOW In summer's heat on tops of lilies feed, END
BEGIN NOW And creep within their bells, to suck the balmy seed: END
BEGIN NOW The winged army roams the fields around; END
BEGIN NOW The rivers and the rocks remurmur to the sound. END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas wond'ring stood, then ask'd the cause END
BEGIN NOW Which to the stream the crowding people draws. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus the sire: "The souls that throng the flood END
BEGIN NOW Are those to whom, by fate, are other bodies ow'd: END
BEGIN NOW In Lethe's lake they long oblivion taste, END
BEGIN NOW Of future life secure, forgetful of the past. END
BEGIN NOW Long has my soul desir'd this time and place, END
BEGIN NOW To set before your sight your glorious race, END
BEGIN NOW That this presaging joy may fire your mind END
BEGIN NOW To seek the shores by destiny design'd."- END
BEGIN NOW O father, can it be, that souls sublime END
BEGIN NOW Return to visit our terrestrial clime, END
BEGIN NOW And that the gen'rous mind, releas'd by death, END
BEGIN NOW Can covet lazy limbs and mortal breath? END
BEGIN NOW Anchises then, in order, thus begun END
BEGIN NOW To clear those wonders to his godlike son: END
BEGIN NOW Know, first, that heav'n, and earth's compacted frame, END
BEGIN NOW And flowing waters, and the starry flame, END
BEGIN NOW And both the radiant lights, one common soul END
BEGIN NOW Inspires and feeds, and animates the whole. END
BEGIN NOW This active mind, infus'd thro' all the space, END
BEGIN NOW Unites and mingles with the mighty mass. END
BEGIN NOW Hence men and beasts the breath of life obtain, END
BEGIN NOW And birds of air, and monsters of the main. END
BEGIN NOW Th' ethereal vigor is in all the same, END
BEGIN NOW And every soul is fill'd with equal flame; END
BEGIN NOW As much as earthy limbs, and gross allay END
BEGIN NOW Of mortal members, subject to decay, END
BEGIN NOW Blunt not the beams of heav'n and edge of day. END
BEGIN NOW From this coarse mixture of terrestrial parts, END
BEGIN NOW Desire and fear by turns possess their hearts, END
BEGIN NOW And grief, and joy; nor can the groveling mind, END
BEGIN NOW In the dark dungeon of the limbs confin'd, END
BEGIN NOW Assert the native skies, or own its heav'nly kind: END
BEGIN NOW Nor death itself can wholly wash their stains; END
BEGIN NOW But long-contracted filth ev'n in the soul remains. END
BEGIN NOW The relics of inveterate vice they wear, END
BEGIN NOW And spots of sin obscene in ev'ry face appear. END
BEGIN NOW For this are various penances enjoin'd; END
BEGIN NOW And some are hung to bleach upon the wind, END
BEGIN NOW Some plung'd in waters, others purg'd in fires, END
BEGIN NOW Till all the dregs are drain'd, and all the rust expires. END
BEGIN NOW All have their manes, and those manes bear: END
BEGIN NOW The few, so cleans'd, to these abodes repair, END
BEGIN NOW And breathe, in ample fields, the soft Elysian air. END
BEGIN NOW Then are they happy, when by length of time END
BEGIN NOW The scurf is worn away of each committed crime; END
BEGIN NOW No speck is left of their habitual stains, END
BEGIN NOW But the pure ether of the soul remains. END
BEGIN NOW But, when a thousand rolling years are past, END
BEGIN NOW (So long their punishments and penance last,) END
BEGIN NOW Whole droves of minds are, by the driving god, END
BEGIN NOW Compell'd to drink the deep Lethaean flood, END
BEGIN NOW In large forgetful draughts to steep the cares END
BEGIN NOW Of their past labors, and their irksome years, END
BEGIN NOW That, unrememb'ring of its former pain, END
BEGIN NOW The soul may suffer mortal flesh again. END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, the father spirit leads END
BEGIN NOW The priestess and his son thro' swarms of shades, END
BEGIN NOW And takes a rising ground, from thence to see END
BEGIN NOW The long procession of his progeny. END
BEGIN NOW Survey, pursued the sire, "this airy throng, END
BEGIN NOW As, offer'd to thy view, they pass along. END
BEGIN NOW These are th' Italian names, which fate will join END
BEGIN NOW With ours, and graff upon the Trojan line. END
BEGIN NOW Observe the youth who first appears in sight, END
BEGIN NOW And holds the nearest station to the light, END
BEGIN NOW Already seems to snuff the vital air, END
BEGIN NOW And leans just forward, on a shining spear: END
BEGIN NOW Silvius is he, thy last-begotten race, END
BEGIN NOW But first in order sent, to fill thy place; END
BEGIN NOW An Alban name, but mix'd with Dardan blood, END
BEGIN NOW Born in the covert of a shady wood: END
BEGIN NOW Him fair Lavinia, thy surviving wife, END
BEGIN NOW Shall breed in groves, to lead a solitary life. END
BEGIN NOW In Alba he shall fix his royal seat, END
BEGIN NOW And, born a king, a race of kings beget. END
BEGIN NOW Then Procas, honor of the Trojan name, END
BEGIN NOW Capys, and Numitor, of endless fame. END
BEGIN NOW A second Silvius after these appears; END
BEGIN NOW Silvius Aeneas, for thy name he bears; END
BEGIN NOW For arms and justice equally renown'd, END
BEGIN NOW Who, late restor'd, in Alba shall be crown'd. END
BEGIN NOW How great they look! how vig'rously they wield END
BEGIN NOW Their weighty lances, and sustain the shield! END
BEGIN NOW But they, who crown'd with oaken wreaths appear, END
BEGIN NOW Shall Gabian walls and strong Fidena rear; END
BEGIN NOW Nomentum, Bola, with Pometia, found; END
BEGIN NOW And raise Collatian tow'rs on rocky ground. END
BEGIN NOW All these shall then be towns of mighty fame, END
BEGIN NOW Tho' now they lie obscure, and lands without a name. END
BEGIN NOW See Romulus the great, born to restore END
BEGIN NOW The crown that once his injur'd grandsire wore. END
BEGIN NOW This prince a priestess of your blood shall bear, END
BEGIN NOW And like his sire in arms he shall appear. END
BEGIN NOW Two rising crests, his royal head adorn; END
BEGIN NOW Born from a god, himself to godhead born: END
BEGIN NOW His sire already signs him for the skies, END
BEGIN NOW And marks the seat amidst the deities. END
BEGIN NOW Auspicious chief! thy race, in times to come, END
BEGIN NOW Shall spread the conquests of imperial Rome- END
BEGIN NOW Rome, whose ascending tow'rs shall heav'n invade, END
BEGIN NOW Involving earth and ocean in her shade; END
BEGIN NOW High as the Mother of the Gods in place, END
BEGIN NOW And proud, like her, of an immortal race. END
BEGIN NOW Then, when in pomp she makes the Phrygian round, END
BEGIN NOW With golden turrets on her temples crown'd; END
BEGIN NOW A hundred gods her sweeping train supply; END
BEGIN NOW Her offspring all, and all command the sky. END
BEGIN NOW Now fix your sight, and stand intent, to see END
BEGIN NOW Your Roman race, and Julian progeny. END
BEGIN NOW The mighty Caesar waits his vital hour, END
BEGIN NOW Impatient for the world, and grasps his promis'd pow'r. END
BEGIN NOW But next behold the youth of form divine, END
BEGIN NOW Ceasar himself, exalted in his line; END
BEGIN NOW Augustus, promis'd oft, and long foretold, END
BEGIN NOW Sent to the realm that Saturn rul'd of old; END
BEGIN NOW Born to restore a better age of gold. END
BEGIN NOW Afric and India shall his pow'r obey; END
BEGIN NOW He shall extend his propagated sway END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the solar year, without the starry way, END
BEGIN NOW Where Atlas turns the rolling heav'ns around, END
BEGIN NOW And his broad shoulders with their lights are crown'd. END
BEGIN NOW At his foreseen approach, already quake END
BEGIN NOW The Caspian kingdoms and Maeotian lake: END
BEGIN NOW Their seers behold the tempest from afar, END
BEGIN NOW And threat'ning oracles denounce the war. END
BEGIN NOW Nile hears him knocking at his sev'nfold gates, END
BEGIN NOW And seeks his hidden spring, and fears his nephew's fates. END
BEGIN NOW Nor Hercules more lands or labors knew, END
BEGIN NOW Not tho' the brazen-footed hind he slew, END
BEGIN NOW Freed Erymanthus from the foaming boar, END
BEGIN NOW And dipp'd his arrows in Lernaean gore; END
BEGIN NOW Nor Bacchus, turning from his Indian war, END
BEGIN NOW By tigers drawn triumphant in his car, END
BEGIN NOW From Nisus' top descending on the plains, END
BEGIN NOW With curling vines around his purple reins. END
BEGIN NOW And doubt we yet thro' dangers to pursue END
BEGIN NOW The paths of honor, and a crown in view? END
BEGIN NOW But what's the man, who from afar appears? END
BEGIN NOW His head with olive crown'd, his hand a censer bears, END
BEGIN NOW His hoary beard and holy vestments bring END
BEGIN NOW His lost idea back: I know the Roman king. END
BEGIN NOW He shall to peaceful Rome new laws ordain, END
BEGIN NOW Call'd from his mean abode a scepter to sustain. END
BEGIN NOW Him Tullus next in dignity succeeds, END
BEGIN NOW An active prince, and prone to martial deeds. END
BEGIN NOW He shall his troops for fighting fields prepare, END
BEGIN NOW Disus'd to toils, and triumphs of the war. END
BEGIN NOW By dint of sword his crown he shall increase, END
BEGIN NOW And scour his armor from the rust of peace. END
BEGIN NOW Whom Ancus follows, with a fawning air, END
BEGIN NOW But vain within, and proudly popular. END
BEGIN NOW Next view the Tarquin kings, th' avenging sword END
BEGIN NOW Of Brutus, justly drawn, and Rome restor'd. END
BEGIN NOW He first renews the rods and ax severe, END
BEGIN NOW And gives the consuls royal robes to wear. END
BEGIN NOW His sons, who seek the tyrant to sustain, END
BEGIN NOW And long for arbitrary lords again, END
BEGIN NOW With ignominy scourg'd, in open sight, END
BEGIN NOW He dooms to death deserv'd, asserting public right. END
BEGIN NOW Unhappy man, to break the pious laws END
BEGIN NOW Of nature, pleading in his children's cause! END
BEGIN NOW Howeer the doubtful fact is understood, END
BEGIN NOW 'T is love of honor, and his country's good: END
BEGIN NOW The consul, not the father, sheds the blood. END
BEGIN NOW Behold Torquatus the same track pursue; END
BEGIN NOW And, next, the two devoted Decii view: END
BEGIN NOW The Drusian line, Camillus loaded home END
BEGIN NOW With standards well redeem'd, and foreign foes o'ercome END
BEGIN NOW The pair you see in equal armor shine, END
BEGIN NOW Now, friends below, in close embraces join; END
BEGIN NOW But, when they leave the shady realms of night, END
BEGIN NOW And, cloth'd in bodies, breathe your upper light, END
BEGIN NOW With mortal hate each other shall pursue: END

BEGIN NOW And thou, the first, lay down thy lawless claim, END
BEGIN NOW Thou, of my blood, who bearist the Julian name! END
BEGIN NOW Another comes, who shall in triumph ride, END
BEGIN NOW And to the Capitol his chariot guide, END
BEGIN NOW From conquer'd Corinth, rich with Grecian spoils. END
BEGIN NOW And yet another, fam'd for warlike toils, END
BEGIN NOW On Argos shall impose the Roman laws, END
BEGIN NOW And on the Greeks revenge the Trojan cause; END
BEGIN NOW Shall drag in chains their Achillean race; END
BEGIN NOW Shall vindicate his ancestors' disgrace, END

BEGIN NOW Let others better mold the running mass END
BEGIN NOW Of metals, and inform the breathing brass, END
BEGIN NOW And soften into flesh a marble face; END
BEGIN NOW Plead better at the bar; describe the skies, END
BEGIN NOW And when the stars descend, and when they rise. END
BEGIN NOW But, Rome, 't is thine alone, with awful sway, END
BEGIN NOW To rule mankind, and make the world obey, END
BEGIN NOW Disposing peace and war by thy own majestic way; END
BEGIN NOW To tame the proud, the fetter'd slave to free: END
BEGIN NOW These are imperial arts, and worthy thee. END
BEGIN NOW He paus'd; and, while with wond'ring eyes they view'd END
BEGIN NOW The passing spirits, thus his speech renew'd: END
BEGIN NOW See great Marcellus! how, untir'd in toils, END
BEGIN NOW He moves with manly grace, how rich with regal spoils! END
BEGIN NOW He, when his country, threaten'd with alarms, END
BEGIN NOW Requires his courage and his conqu'ring arms, END
BEGIN NOW Shall more than once the Punic bands affright; END
BEGIN NOW Shall kill the Gaulish king in single fight; END
BEGIN NOW Then to the Capitol in triumph move, END
BEGIN NOW And the third spoils shall grace Feretrian Jove. END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas here beheld, of form divine, END
BEGIN NOW A godlike youth in glitt'ring armor shine, END
BEGIN NOW With great Marcellus keeping equal pace; END
BEGIN NOW But gloomy were his eyes, dejected was his face. END
BEGIN NOW He saw, and, wond'ring, ask'd his airy guide, END
BEGIN NOW What and of whence was he, who press'd the hero's side: END
BEGIN NOW His son, or one of his illustrious name? END
BEGIN NOW How like the former, and almost the same! END
BEGIN NOW Observe the crowds that compass him around; END
BEGIN NOW All gaze, and all admire, and raise a shouting sound: END
BEGIN NOW But hov'ring mists around his brows are spread, END
BEGIN NOW And night, with sable shades, involves his head. END
BEGIN NOW Seek not to know," the ghost replied with tears, END
BEGIN NOW The sorrows of thy sons in future years. END
BEGIN NOW This youth (the blissful vision of a day) END
BEGIN NOW Shall just be shown on earth, and snatch'd away. END
BEGIN NOW The gods too high had rais'd the Roman state, END
BEGIN NOW Were but their gifts as permanent as great. END
BEGIN NOW What groans of men shall fill the Martian field! END
BEGIN NOW How fierce a blaze his flaming pile shall yield! END
BEGIN NOW What fun'ral pomp shall floating Tiber see, END
BEGIN NOW When, rising from his bed, he views the sad solemnity! END
BEGIN NOW No youth shall equal hopes of glory give, END
BEGIN NOW No youth afford so great a cause to grieve; END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan honor, and the Roman boast, END
BEGIN NOW Admir'd when living, and ador'd when lost! END
BEGIN NOW Mirror of ancient faith in early youth! END
BEGIN NOW Undaunted worth, inviolable truth! END
BEGIN NOW No foe, unpunish'd, in the fighting field END
BEGIN NOW Shall dare thee, foot to foot, with sword and shield; END
BEGIN NOW Much less in arms oppose thy matchless force, END
BEGIN NOW When thy sharp spurs shall urge thy foaming horse. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! couldst thou break thro' fate's severe decree, END
BEGIN NOW A new Marcellus shall arise in thee! END
BEGIN NOW Full canisters of fragrant lilies bring, END
BEGIN NOW Mix'd with the purple roses of the spring; END
BEGIN NOW Let me with fun'ral flow'rs his body strow; END
BEGIN NOW This gift which parents to their children owe, END
BEGIN NOW This unavailing gift, at least, I may bestow! END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, he led the hero round END
BEGIN NOW The confines of the blest Elysian ground; END
BEGIN NOW Which when Anchises to his son had shown, END
BEGIN NOW And fir'd his mind to mount the promis'd throne, END
BEGIN NOW He tells the future wars, ordain'd by fate; END
BEGIN NOW The strength and customs of the Latian state; END
BEGIN NOW The prince, and people; and forearms his care END
BEGIN NOW With rules, to push his fortune, or to bear. END
BEGIN NOW Two gates the silent house of Sleep adorn; END
BEGIN NOW Of polish'd ivory this, that of transparent horn: END
BEGIN NOW True visions thro' transparent horn arise; END
BEGIN NOW Thro' polish'd ivory pass deluding lies. END
BEGIN NOW Of various things discoursing as he pass'd, END
BEGIN NOW Anchises hither bends his steps at last. END
BEGIN NOW Then, thro' the gate of iv'ry, he dismiss'd END
BEGIN NOW His valiant offspring and divining guest. END
BEGIN NOW Straight to the ships Aeneas his way, END
BEGIN NOW Embark'd his men, and skimm'd along the sea, END
BEGIN NOW Still coasting, till he gain'd Cajeta's bay. END
BEGIN NOW At length on oozy ground his galleys moor; END
BEGIN NOW Their heads are turn'd to sea, their sterns to shore. END
BEGIN NOW And thou, O matron of immortal fame, END
BEGIN NOW Here dying, to the shore hast left thy name; END
BEGIN NOW Cajeta still the place is call'd from thee, END
BEGIN NOW The nurse of great Aeneas' infancy. END
BEGIN NOW Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperia's plains; END
BEGIN NOW Thy name ('t is all a ghost can have) remains. END
BEGIN NOW Now, when the prince her fun'ral rites had paid, END
BEGIN NOW He plow'd the Tyrrhene seas with sails display'd. END
BEGIN NOW From land a gentle breeze arose by night, END
BEGIN NOW Serenely shone the stars, the moon was bright, END
BEGIN NOW And the sea trembled with her silver light. END
BEGIN NOW Now near the shelves of Circe's shores they run, END
BEGIN NOW (Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,) END
BEGIN NOW A dang'rous coast: the goddess wastes her days END
BEGIN NOW In joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays: END
BEGIN NOW In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night, END
BEGIN NOW And cedar brands supply her father's light. END
BEGIN NOW From hence were heard, rebellowing to the main, END
BEGIN NOW The roars of lions that refuse the chain, END
BEGIN NOW The grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears, END
BEGIN NOW And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' ears. END
BEGIN NOW These from their caverns, at the close of night, END
BEGIN NOW Fill the sad isle with horror and affright. END
BEGIN NOW Darkling they mourn their fate, whom Circe's pow'r, END
BEGIN NOW (That watch'd the moon and planetary hour,) END
BEGIN NOW With words and wicked herbs from humankind END
BEGIN NOW Had alter'd, and in brutal shapes confin'd. END
BEGIN NOW Which monsters lest the Trojans' pious host END
BEGIN NOW Should bear, or touch upon th' inchanted coast, END
BEGIN NOW Propitious Neptune steer'd their course by night END
BEGIN NOW With rising gales that sped their happy flight. END
BEGIN NOW Supplied with these, they skim the sounding shore, END
BEGIN NOW And hear the swelling surges vainly roar. END
BEGIN NOW Now, when the rosy morn began to rise, END
BEGIN NOW And wav'd her saffron streamer thro' the skies; END
BEGIN NOW When Thetis blush'd in purple not her own, END
BEGIN NOW And from her face the breathing winds were blown, END
BEGIN NOW A sudden silence sate upon the sea, END
BEGIN NOW And sweeping oars, with struggling, urge their way. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan, from the main, beheld a wood, END
BEGIN NOW Which thick with shades and a brown horror stood: END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt the trees the Tiber took his course, END
BEGIN NOW With whirlpools dimpled; and with downward force, END
BEGIN NOW That drove the sand along, he took his way, END
BEGIN NOW And roll'd his yellow billows to the sea. END
BEGIN NOW About him, and above, and round the wood, END
BEGIN NOW The birds that haunt the borders of his flood, END
BEGIN NOW That bath'd within, or basked upon his side, END
BEGIN NOW To tuneful songs their narrow throats applied. END
BEGIN NOW The captain gives command; the joyful train END
BEGIN NOW Glide thro' the gloomy shade, and leave the main. END
BEGIN NOW Now, Erato, thy poet's mind inspire, END
BEGIN NOW And fill his soul with thy celestial fire! END
BEGIN NOW Relate what Latium was; her ancient kings; END
BEGIN NOW Declare the past and state of things, END
BEGIN NOW When first the Trojan fleet Ausonia sought, END
BEGIN NOW And how the rivals lov'd, and how they fought. END
BEGIN NOW These are my theme, and how the war began, END
BEGIN NOW And how concluded by the godlike man: END
BEGIN NOW For I shall sing of battles, blood, and rage, END
BEGIN NOW Which princes and their people did engage; END
BEGIN NOW And haughty souls, that, mov'd with mutual hate, END
BEGIN NOW In fighting fields pursued and found their fate; END
BEGIN NOW That rous'd the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms, END
BEGIN NOW And peaceful Italy involv'd in arms. END
BEGIN NOW A larger scene of action is display'd; END
BEGIN NOW And, rising hence, a greater work is weigh'd. END
BEGIN NOW Latinus, old and mild, had long possess'd END
BEGIN NOW The Latin scepter, and his people blest: END
BEGIN NOW His father Faunus; a Laurentian dame END
BEGIN NOW His mother; fair Marica was her name. END
BEGIN NOW But Faunus came from Picus: Picus drew END
BEGIN NOW His birth from Saturn, if records be true. END
BEGIN NOW Thus King Latinus, in the third degree, END
BEGIN NOW Had Saturn author of his family. END
BEGIN NOW But this old peaceful prince, as Heav'n decreed, END
BEGIN NOW Was blest with no male issue to succeed: END
BEGIN NOW His sons in blooming youth were snatch'd by fate; END
BEGIN NOW One only daughter heir'd the royal state. END
BEGIN NOW Fir'd with her love, and with ambition led, END
BEGIN NOW The neighb'ring princes court her nuptial bed. END
BEGIN NOW Among the crowd, but far above the rest, END
BEGIN NOW Young Turnus to the beauteous maid address'd. END
BEGIN NOW Turnus, for high descent and graceful mien, END
BEGIN NOW Was first, and favor'd by the Latian queen; END
BEGIN NOW With him she strove to join Lavinia's hand, END
BEGIN NOW But dire portents the purpos'd match withstand. END
BEGIN NOW Deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood END
BEGIN NOW A laurel's trunk, a venerable wood; END
BEGIN NOW Where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair END
BEGIN NOW Was kept and cut with superstitious care. END
BEGIN NOW This plant Latinus, when his town he wall'd, END
BEGIN NOW Then found, and from the tree Laurentum call'd; END
BEGIN NOW And last, in honor of his new abode, END
BEGIN NOW He vow'd the laurel to the laurel's god. END
BEGIN NOW It happen'd once (a boding prodigy!) END
BEGIN NOW A swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky, END
BEGIN NOW (Unknown from whence they took their airy flight,) END
BEGIN NOW Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight; END
BEGIN NOW There with their clasping feet together clung, END
BEGIN NOW And a long cluster from the laurel hung. END
BEGIN NOW An ancient augur prophesied from hence: END
BEGIN NOW Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince! END
BEGIN NOW From the same parts of heav'n his navy stands, END
BEGIN NOW To the same parts on earth; his army lands; END
BEGIN NOW The town he conquers, and the tow'r commands. END
BEGIN NOW Yet more, when fair Lavinia fed the fire END
BEGIN NOW Before the gods, and stood beside her sire, END
BEGIN NOW (Strange to relate!) the flames, involv'd in smoke END
BEGIN NOW Of incense, from the sacred altar broke, END
BEGIN NOW Caught her dishevel'd hair and rich attire; END
BEGIN NOW From thence the fuming trail began to spread END
BEGIN NOW And lambent glories danc'd about her head. END
BEGIN NOW This new portent the seer with wonder views, END
BEGIN NOW Then pausing, thus his prophecy renews: END
BEGIN NOW The nymph, who scatters flaming fires around, END
BEGIN NOW Shall shine with honor, shall herself be crown'd; END
BEGIN NOW But, caus'd by her irrevocable fate, END
BEGIN NOW War shall the country waste, and change the state. END
BEGIN NOW Latinus, frighted with this dire ostent, END
BEGIN NOW For counsel to his father Faunus went, END
BEGIN NOW And sought the shades renown'd for prophecy END
BEGIN NOW Which near Albunea's sulph'rous fountain lie. END
BEGIN NOW To these the Latian and the Sabine land END
BEGIN NOW Fly, when distress'd, and thence relief demand. END
BEGIN NOW The priest on skins of off'rings takes his ease, END
BEGIN NOW And nightly visions in his slumber sees; END
BEGIN NOW A swarm of thin aerial shapes appears, END
BEGIN NOW And, flutt'ring round his temples, deafs his ears: END
BEGIN NOW These he consults, the future fates to know, END
BEGIN NOW From pow'rs above, and from the fiends below. END
BEGIN NOW Here, for the gods' advice, Latinus flies, END
BEGIN NOW Off'ring a hundred sheep for sacrifice: END
BEGIN NOW Their woolly fleeces, as the rites requir'd, END
BEGIN NOW He laid beneath him, and to rest retir'd. END
BEGIN NOW No sooner were his eyes in slumber bound, END
BEGIN NOW When, from above, a more than mortal sound END
BEGIN NOW Invades his ears; and thus the vision spoke: END
BEGIN NOW Seek not, my seed, in Latian bands to yoke END
BEGIN NOW Our fair Lavinia, nor the gods provoke. END
BEGIN NOW A foreign son upon thy shore descends, END
BEGIN NOW Whose martial fame from pole to pole extends. END
BEGIN NOW His race, in arms and arts of peace renown'd, END
BEGIN NOW Not Latium shall contain, nor Europe bound: END
BEGIN NOW 'T is theirs whate'er the sun surveys around. END
BEGIN NOW These answers, in the silent night receiv'd, END
BEGIN NOW The king himself divulg'd, the land believ'd: END
BEGIN NOW The fame thro' all the neighb'ring nations flew, END
BEGIN NOW When now the Trojan navy was in view. END
BEGIN NOW Beneath a shady tree, the hero spread END
BEGIN NOW His table on the turf, with cakes of bread; END
BEGIN NOW And, with his chiefs, on forest fruits he fed. END
BEGIN NOW They sate; and, (not without the god's command,) END
BEGIN NOW Their homely fare dispatch'd, the hungry band END
BEGIN NOW Invade their trenchers next, and soon devour, END
BEGIN NOW To mend the scanty meal, their cakes of flour. END
BEGIN NOW Ascanius this observ'd, and smiling said: END
BEGIN NOW See, we devour the plates on which we fed. END
BEGIN NOW The speech had omen, that the Trojan race END
BEGIN NOW Should find repose, and this the time and place. END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas took the word, and thus replies, END
BEGIN NOW Confessing fate with wonder in his eyes: END
BEGIN NOW All hail, O earth! all hail, my household gods! END
BEGIN NOW Behold the destin'd place of your abodes! END
BEGIN NOW For thus Anchises prophesied of old, END
BEGIN NOW And this our fatal place of rest foretold: END
BEGIN NOW 'When, on a foreign shore, instead of meat, END
BEGIN NOW By famine forc'd, your trenchers you shall eat, END
BEGIN NOW Then ease your weary Trojans will attend, END
BEGIN NOW And the long labors of your voyage end. END
BEGIN NOW Remember on that happy coast to build, END
BEGIN NOW And with a trench inclose the fruitful field.' END
BEGIN NOW This was that famine, this the fatal place END
BEGIN NOW Which ends the wand'ring of our exil'd race. END
BEGIN NOW Then, on to-morrow's dawn, your care employ, END
BEGIN NOW To search the land, and where the cities lie, END
BEGIN NOW And what the men; but give this day to joy. END
BEGIN NOW Now pour to Jove; and, after Jove is blest, END
BEGIN NOW Call great Anchises to the genial feast: END
BEGIN NOW Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught; END
BEGIN NOW Enjoy the present hour; adjourn the future thought. END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, the hero bound his brows END
BEGIN NOW With leafy branches, then perform'd his vows; END
BEGIN NOW Adoring first the genius of the place, END
BEGIN NOW Then Earth, the mother of the heav'nly race, END
BEGIN NOW The nymphs, and native godheads yet unknown, END
BEGIN NOW And Night, and all the stars that gild her sable throne, END
BEGIN NOW And ancient Cybel, and Idaean Jove, END
BEGIN NOW And last his sire below, and mother queen above. END
BEGIN NOW Then heav'n's high monarch thunder'd thrice aloud, END
BEGIN NOW And thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud. END
BEGIN NOW Soon thro' the joyful camp a rumor flew, END
BEGIN NOW The time was come their city to renew. END
BEGIN NOW Then ev'ry brow with cheerful green is crown'd, END
BEGIN NOW The feasts are doubled, and the bowls go round. END
BEGIN NOW When next the rosy morn disclos'd the day, END
BEGIN NOW The scouts to sev'ral parts divide their way, END
BEGIN NOW To learn the natives' names, their towns explore, END
BEGIN NOW The coasts and trendings of the crooked shore: END
BEGIN NOW Here Tiber flows, and here Numicus stands; END
BEGIN NOW Here warlike Latins hold the happy lands. END
BEGIN NOW The pious chief, who sought by peaceful ways END
BEGIN NOW To found his empire, and his town to raise, END
BEGIN NOW A hundred youths from all his train selects, END
BEGIN NOW And to the Latian court their course directs, END
BEGIN NOW (The spacious palace where their prince resides,) END
BEGIN NOW And all their heads with wreaths of olive hides. END
BEGIN NOW They go commission'd to require a peace, END
BEGIN NOW And carry presents to procure access. END
BEGIN NOW Thus while they speed their pace, the prince designs END
BEGIN NOW His new-elected seat, and draws the lines. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojans round the place a rampire cast, END
BEGIN NOW And palisades about the trenches plac'd. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime the train, proceeding on their way, END
BEGIN NOW From far the town and lofty tow'rs survey; END
BEGIN NOW At length approach the walls. Without the gate, END
BEGIN NOW They see the boys and Latian youth debate END
BEGIN NOW The martial prizes on the dusty plain: END
BEGIN NOW Some drive the cars, and some the coursers rein; END
BEGIN NOW Some bend the stubborn bow for victory, END
BEGIN NOW And some with darts their active sinews try. END
BEGIN NOW A posting messenger, dispatch'd from hence, END
BEGIN NOW Of this fair troop advis'd their aged prince, END
BEGIN NOW That foreign men of mighty stature came; END
BEGIN NOW Uncouth their habit, and unknown their name. END
BEGIN NOW The king ordains their entrance, and ascends END
BEGIN NOW His regal seat, surrounded by his friends. END
BEGIN NOW The palace built by Picus, vast and proud, END
BEGIN NOW Supported by a hundred pillars stood, END
BEGIN NOW And round incompass'd with a rising wood. END
BEGIN NOW The pile o'erlook'd the town, and drew the sight; END
BEGIN NOW Surpris'd at once with reverence and delight. END
BEGIN NOW There kings receiv'd the marks of sov'reign pow'r; END
BEGIN NOW In state the monarchs march'd; the lictors bore END
BEGIN NOW Their awful axes and the rods before. END
BEGIN NOW Here the tribunal stood, the house of pray'r, END
BEGIN NOW And here the sacred senators repair; END
BEGIN NOW All at large tables, in long order set, END
BEGIN NOW A ram their off'ring, and a ram their meat. END
BEGIN NOW Above the portal, carv'd in cedar wood, END
BEGIN NOW Plac'd in their ranks, their godlike grandsires stood; END
BEGIN NOW Old Saturn, with his crooked scythe, on high; END
BEGIN NOW And Italus, that led the colony; END
BEGIN NOW And ancient Janus, with his double face, END
BEGIN NOW And bunch of keys, the porter of the place. END
BEGIN NOW There good Sabinus, planter of the vines, END
BEGIN NOW On a short pruning hook his head reclines, END
BEGIN NOW And studiously surveys his gen'rous wines; END
BEGIN NOW Then warlike kings, who for their country fought, END
BEGIN NOW And honorable wounds from battle brought. END
BEGIN NOW Around the posts hung helmets, darts, and spears, END
BEGIN NOW And captive chariots, axes, shields, and bars, END
BEGIN NOW And broken beaks of ships, the trophies of their wars. END
BEGIN NOW Above the rest, as chief of all the band, END
BEGIN NOW Was Picus plac'd, a buckler in his hand; END
BEGIN NOW His other wav'd a long divining wand. END
BEGIN NOW Girt in his Gabin gown the hero sate, END
BEGIN NOW Yet could not with his art avoid his fate: END
BEGIN NOW For Circe long had lov'd the youth in vain, END
BEGIN NOW Till love, refus'd, converted to disdain: END
BEGIN NOW Then, mixing pow'rful herbs, with magic art, END
BEGIN NOW She chang'd his form, who could not change his heart; END
BEGIN NOW Constrain'd him in a bird, and made him fly, END
BEGIN NOW With party-color'd plumes, a chatt'ring pie. END
BEGIN NOW In this high temple, on a chair of state, END
BEGIN NOW The seat of audience, old Latinus sate; END
BEGIN NOW Then gave admission to the Trojan train; END
BEGIN NOW And thus with pleasing accents he began: END
BEGIN NOW Tell me, ye Trojans, for that name you own, END
BEGIN NOW Nor is your course upon our coasts unknown- END
BEGIN NOW Say what you seek, and whither were you bound: END
BEGIN NOW Were you by stress of weather cast aground? END
BEGIN NOW (Such dangers as on seas are often seen, END
BEGIN NOW And oft befall to miserable men,) END
BEGIN NOW Or come, your shipping in our ports to lay, END
BEGIN NOW Spent and disabled in so long a way? END
BEGIN NOW Say what you want: the Latians you shall find END
BEGIN NOW Not forc'd to goodness, but by will inclin'd; END
BEGIN NOW For, since the time of Saturn's holy reign, END
BEGIN NOW His hospitable customs we retain. END
BEGIN NOW I call to mind (but time the tale has worn) END
BEGIN NOW Th' Arunci told, that Dardanus, tho' born END
BEGIN NOW On Latian plains, yet sought the Phrygian shore, END
BEGIN NOW And Samothracia, Samos call'd before. END
BEGIN NOW From Tuscan Coritum he claim'd his birth; END
BEGIN NOW But after, when exempt from mortal earth, END
BEGIN NOW From thence ascended to his kindred skies, END
BEGIN NOW A god, and, as a god, augments their sacrifice, END
BEGIN NOW He said. Ilioneus made this reply: END
BEGIN NOW O king, of Faunus' royal family! END
BEGIN NOW Nor wintry winds to Latium forc'd our way, END
BEGIN NOW Nor did the stars our wand'ring course betray. END
BEGIN NOW Willing we sought your shores; and, hither bound, END
BEGIN NOW The port, so long desir'd, at length we found; END
BEGIN NOW From our sweet homes and ancient realms expell'd; END
BEGIN NOW Great as the greatest that the sun beheld. END
BEGIN NOW The god began our line, who rules above; END
BEGIN NOW And, as our race, our king descends from Jove: END
BEGIN NOW And hither are we come, by his command, END
BEGIN NOW To crave admission in your happy land. END
BEGIN NOW How dire a tempest, from Mycenae pour'd, END
BEGIN NOW Our plains, our temples, and our town devour'd; END
BEGIN NOW What was the waste of war, what fierce alarms END
BEGIN NOW Shook Asia's crown with European arms; END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n such have heard, if any such there be, END
BEGIN NOW Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea; END
BEGIN NOW And such as, born beneath the burning sky END
BEGIN NOW And sultry sun, betwixt the tropics lie. END
BEGIN NOW From that dire deluge, thro' the wat'ry waste, END
BEGIN NOW Such length of years, such various perils past, END
BEGIN NOW At last escap'd, to Latium we repair, END
BEGIN NOW To beg what you without your want may spare: END
BEGIN NOW The common water, and the common air; END
BEGIN NOW Sheds which ourselves will build, and mean abodes, END
BEGIN NOW Fit to receive and serve our banish'd gods. END
BEGIN NOW Nor our admission shall your realm disgrace, END
BEGIN NOW Nor length of time our gratitude efface. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, what endless honor you shall gain, END
BEGIN NOW To save and shelter Troy's unhappy train! END
BEGIN NOW Now, by my sov'reign, and his fate, I swear, END
BEGIN NOW Renown'd for faith in peace, for force in war; END
BEGIN NOW Oft our alliance other lands desir'd, END
BEGIN NOW And, what we seek of you, of us requir'd. END
BEGIN NOW Despite not then, that in our hands we bear END
BEGIN NOW These holy boughs, sue with words of pray'r. END
BEGIN NOW Fate and the gods, by their supreme command, END
BEGIN NOW Have doom'd our ships to seek the Latian land. END
BEGIN NOW To these abodes our fleet Apollo sends; END
BEGIN NOW Here Dardanus was born, and hither tends; END
BEGIN NOW Where Tuscan Tiber rolls with rapid force, END
BEGIN NOW And where Numicus opes his holy source. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, our prince presents, with his request, END
BEGIN NOW Some small remains of what his sire possess'd. END
BEGIN NOW This golden charger, snatch'd from burning Troy, END
BEGIN NOW Anchises did in sacrifice employ; END
BEGIN NOW This royal robe and this tiara wore END
BEGIN NOW Old Priam, and this golden scepter bore END
BEGIN NOW In full assemblies, and in solemn games; END
BEGIN NOW These purple vests were weav'd by Dardan dames. END
BEGIN NOW Thus while he spoke, Latinus roll'd around END
BEGIN NOW His eyes, and fix'd a while upon the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Intent he seem'd, and anxious in his breast; END
BEGIN NOW Not by the scepter mov'd, or kingly vest, END
BEGIN NOW But pond'ring future things of wondrous weight; END
BEGIN NOW Succession, empire, and his daughter's fate. END
BEGIN NOW On these he mus'd within his thoughtful mind, END
BEGIN NOW And then revolv'd what Faunus had divin'd. END
BEGIN NOW This was the foreign prince, by fate decreed END
BEGIN NOW To share his scepter, and Lavinia's bed; END
BEGIN NOW This was the race that sure portents foreshew END
BEGIN NOW To sway the world, and land and sea subdue. END
BEGIN NOW At length he rais'd his cheerful head, and spoke: END
BEGIN NOW The pow'rs," said he, "the pow'rs we both invoke, END
BEGIN NOW To you, and yours, and mine, propitious be, END
BEGIN NOW And firm our purpose with their augury! END
BEGIN NOW Have what you ask; your presents I receive; END
BEGIN NOW Land, where and when you please, with ample leave; END
BEGIN NOW Partake and use my kingdom as your own; END
BEGIN NOW All shall be yours, while I command the crown: END
BEGIN NOW And, if my wish'd alliance please your king, END
BEGIN NOW Tell him he should not send the peace, but bring. END
BEGIN NOW Then let him not a friend's embraces fear; END
BEGIN NOW The peace is made when I behold him here. END
BEGIN NOW Besides this answer, tell my royal guest, END
BEGIN NOW I add to his commands my own request: END
BEGIN NOW One only daughter heirs my crown and state, END
BEGIN NOW Whom not our oracles, nor Heav'n, nor fate, END
BEGIN NOW Nor frequent prodigies, permit to join END
BEGIN NOW With any native of th' Ausonian line. END
BEGIN NOW A foreign son-in-law shall come from far END
BEGIN NOW (Such is our doom), a chief renown'd in war, END
BEGIN NOW Whose race shall bear aloft the Latian name, END
BEGIN NOW And thro' the conquer'd world diffuse our fame. END
BEGIN NOW Himself to be the man the fates require, END
BEGIN NOW I firmly judge, and, what I judge, desire. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and then on each bestow'd a steed. END
BEGIN NOW Three hundred horses, in high stables fed, END
BEGIN NOW Stood ready, shining all, and smoothly dress'd: END
BEGIN NOW Of these he chose the fairest and the best, END
BEGIN NOW To mount the Trojan troop. At his command END
BEGIN NOW The steeds caparison'd with purple stand, END
BEGIN NOW With golden trappings, glorious to behold, END
BEGIN NOW And champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold. END
BEGIN NOW Then to his absent guest the king decreed END
BEGIN NOW A pair of coursers born of heav'nly breed, END
BEGIN NOW Who from their nostrils breath'd ethereal fire; END
BEGIN NOW Whom Circe stole from her celestial sire, END
BEGIN NOW By substituting mares produc'd on earth, END
BEGIN NOW Whose wombs conceiv'd a more than mortal birth. END
BEGIN NOW These draw the chariot which Latinus sends, END
BEGIN NOW And the rich present to the prince commends. END
BEGIN NOW Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne, END
BEGIN NOW To their expecting lord with peace return. END
BEGIN NOW But jealous Juno, from Pachynus' height, END
BEGIN NOW As she from Argos took her airy flight, END
BEGIN NOW Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight. END
BEGIN NOW She saw the Trojan and his joyful train END
BEGIN NOW Descend upon the shore, desert the main, END
BEGIN NOW Design a town, and, with unhop'd success, END
BEGIN NOW Th' embassadors return with promis'd peace. END
BEGIN NOW Then, pierc'd with pain, she shook her haughty head, END
BEGIN NOW Sigh'd from her inward soul, and thus she said: END
BEGIN NOW O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes! END
BEGIN NOW O fates of Troy, which Juno's fates oppose! END
BEGIN NOW Could they not fall unpitied on the plain, END
BEGIN NOW But slain revive, and, taken, scape again? END
BEGIN NOW When execrable Troy in ashes lay, END
BEGIN NOW Thro' fires and swords and seas they forc'd their way. END
BEGIN NOW Then vanquish'd Juno must in vain contend, END
BEGIN NOW Her rage disarm'd, her empire at an end. END
BEGIN NOW Breathless and tir'd, is all my fury spent? END
BEGIN NOW Or does my glutted spleen at length relent? END
BEGIN NOW As if 't were little from their town to chase, END
BEGIN NOW I thro' the seas pursued their exil'd race; END
BEGIN NOW Ingag'd the heav'ns, oppos'd the stormy main; END
BEGIN NOW But billows roar'd, and tempests rag'd in vain. END
BEGIN NOW What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done, END
BEGIN NOW When these they overpass, and those they shun? END
BEGIN NOW On Tiber's shores they land, secure of fate, END
BEGIN NOW Triumphant o'er the storms and Juno's hate. END
BEGIN NOW Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe, END
BEGIN NOW And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia's wrath, END
BEGIN NOW Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon; END
BEGIN NOW (What great offense had either people done?) END
BEGIN NOW But I, the consort of the Thunderer, END
BEGIN NOW Have wag'd a long and unsuccessful war, END
BEGIN NOW With various arts and arms in vain have toil'd, END
BEGIN NOW And by a mortal man at length am foil'd. END
BEGIN NOW If native pow'r prevail not, shall I doubt END
BEGIN NOW To seek for needful succor from without? END
BEGIN NOW If Jove and Heav'n my just desires deny, END
BEGIN NOW Hell shall the pow'r of Heav'n and Jove supply. END
BEGIN NOW Grant that the Fates have firm'd, by their decree, END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan race to reign in Italy; END
BEGIN NOW At least I can defer the nuptial day, END
BEGIN NOW And with protracted wars the peace delay: END
BEGIN NOW With blood the dear alliance shall be bought, END
BEGIN NOW And both the people near destruction brought; END
BEGIN NOW So shall the son-in-law and father join, END
BEGIN NOW With ruin, war, and waste of either line. END
BEGIN NOW O fatal maid, thy marriage is endow'd END
BEGIN NOW With Phrygian, Latian, and Rutulian blood! END
BEGIN NOW Bellona leads thee to thy lover's hand; END
BEGIN NOW Another queen brings forth another brand, END
BEGIN NOW To burn with foreign fires another land! END
BEGIN NOW A second Paris, diff'ring but in name, END
BEGIN NOW Shall fire his country with a second flame. END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, she sinks beneath the ground, END
BEGIN NOW With furious haste, and shoots the Stygian sound, END
BEGIN NOW To rouse Alecto from th' infernal seat END
BEGIN NOW Of her dire sisters, and their dark retreat. END
BEGIN NOW This Fury, fit for her intent, she chose; END
BEGIN NOW One who delights in wars and human woes. END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n Pluto hates his own misshapen race; END
BEGIN NOW Her sister Furies fly her hideous face; END
BEGIN NOW So frightful are the forms the monster takes, END
BEGIN NOW So fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes. END
BEGIN NOW Her Juno finds, and thus inflames her spite: END
BEGIN NOW O virgin daughter of eternal Night, END
BEGIN NOW Give me this once thy labor, to sustain END
BEGIN NOW My right, and execute my just disdain. END
BEGIN NOW Let not the Trojans, with a feign'd pretense END
BEGIN NOW Of proffer'd peace, delude the Latian prince. END
BEGIN NOW Expel from Italy that odious name, END
BEGIN NOW And let not Juno suffer in her fame. END
BEGIN NOW 'T is thine to ruin realms, o'erturn a state, END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate, END
BEGIN NOW And kindle kindred blood to mutual hate. END
BEGIN NOW Thy hand o'er towns the fun'ral torch displays, END
BEGIN NOW And forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways. END
BEGIN NOW Now shake, out thy fruitful breast, the seeds END
BEGIN NOW Of envy, discord, and of cruel deeds: END
BEGIN NOW Confound the peace establish'd, and prepare END
BEGIN NOW Their souls to hatred, and their hands to war. END
BEGIN NOW Smear'd as she was with black Gorgonian blood, END
BEGIN NOW The Fury sprang above the Stygian flood; END
BEGIN NOW And on her wicker wings, sublime thro' night, END
BEGIN NOW She to the Latian palace took her flight: END
BEGIN NOW There sought the queen's apartment, stood before END
BEGIN NOW The peaceful threshold, and besieg'd the door. END
BEGIN NOW Restless Amata lay, her swelling breast END
BEGIN NOW Fir'd with disdain for Turnus dispossess'd, END
BEGIN NOW And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest. END
BEGIN NOW From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes END
BEGIN NOW Her darling plague, the fav'rite of her snakes; END
BEGIN NOW With her full force she threw the poisonous dart, END
BEGIN NOW And fix'd it deep within Amata's heart, END
BEGIN NOW That, thus envenom'd, she might kindle rage, END
BEGIN NOW And sacrifice to strife her house husband's age. END
BEGIN NOW Unseen, unfelt, the fiery serpent skims END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt her linen and her naked limbs; END
BEGIN NOW His baleful breath inspiring, as he glides, END
BEGIN NOW Now like a chain around her neck he rides, END
BEGIN NOW Now like a fillet to her head repairs, END
BEGIN NOW And with his circling volumes folds her hairs. END
BEGIN NOW At first the silent venom slid with ease, END
BEGIN NOW And seiz'd her cooler senses by degrees; END
BEGIN NOW Then, ere th' infected mass was fir'd too far, END
BEGIN NOW In plaintive accents she began the war, END
BEGIN NOW And thus bespoke her husband: "Shall," she said, END
BEGIN NOW A wand'ring prince enjoy Lavinia's bed? END
BEGIN NOW If nature plead not in a parent's heart, END
BEGIN NOW Pity my tears, and pity her desert. END
BEGIN NOW I know, my dearest lord, the time will come, END
BEGIN NOW You in vain, reverse your cruel doom; END
BEGIN NOW The faithless pirate soon will set to sea, END
BEGIN NOW And bear the royal virgin far away! END
BEGIN NOW A guest like him, a Trojan guest before, END
BEGIN NOW In shew of friendship sought the Spartan shore, END
BEGIN NOW And ravish'd Helen from her husband bore. END
BEGIN NOW Think on a king's inviolable word; END
BEGIN NOW And think on Turnus, her once plighted lord: END
BEGIN NOW To this false foreigner you give your throne, END
BEGIN NOW And wrong a friend, a kinsman, and a son. END
BEGIN NOW Resume your ancient care; and, if the god END
BEGIN NOW Your sire, and you, resolve on foreign blood, END
BEGIN NOW Know all are foreign, in a larger sense, END
BEGIN NOW Not born your subjects, or deriv'd from hence. END
BEGIN NOW Then, if the line of Turnus you retrace, END
BEGIN NOW He springs from Inachus of Argive race. END
BEGIN NOW But when she saw her reasons idly spent, END
BEGIN NOW And could not move him from his fix'd intent, END
BEGIN NOW She flew to rage; for now the snake possess'd END
BEGIN NOW Her vital parts, and poison'd all her breast; END
BEGIN NOW She raves, she runs with a distracted pace, END
BEGIN NOW And fills with horrid howls the public place. END
BEGIN NOW And, as young striplings whip the top for sport, END
BEGIN NOW On the smooth pavement of an empty court; END
BEGIN NOW The wooden engine flies and whirls about, END
BEGIN NOW Admir'd, with clamors, of the beardless rout; END
BEGIN NOW They lash aloud; each other they provoke, END
BEGIN NOW And lend their little souls at ev'ry stroke: END
BEGIN NOW Thus fares the queen; and thus her fury blows END
BEGIN NOW Amidst the crowd, and kindles as she goes. END
BEGIN NOW Nor yet content, she strains her malice more, END
BEGIN NOW And adds new ills to those contriv'd before: END
BEGIN NOW She flies the town, and, mixing with a throng END
BEGIN NOW Of madding matrons, bears the bride along, END
BEGIN NOW Wand'ring thro' woods and wilds, and devious ways, END
BEGIN NOW And with these arts the Trojan match delays. END
BEGIN NOW She feign'd the rites of Bacchus; cried aloud, END
BEGIN NOW And to the buxom god the virgin vow'd. END
BEGIN NOW Evoe! O Bacchus!" thus began the song; END
BEGIN NOW And "Evoe!" answer'd all the female throng. END
BEGIN NOW O virgin! worthy thee alone!" she cried; END
BEGIN NOW O worthy thee alone!" the crew replied. END
BEGIN NOW For thee she feeds her hair, she leads thy dance, END
BEGIN NOW And with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance. END
BEGIN NOW Like fury seiz'd the rest; the progress known, END
BEGIN NOW All seek the mountains, and forsake the town: END
BEGIN NOW All, clad in skins of beasts, the jav'lin bear, END
BEGIN NOW Give to the wanton winds their flowing hair, END
BEGIN NOW And shrieks and shoutings rend the suff'ring air. END
BEGIN NOW The queen herself, inspir'd with rage divine, END
BEGIN NOW Shook high above her head a flaming pine; END
BEGIN NOW Then roll'd her haggard eyes around the throng, END
BEGIN NOW And sung, in Turnus' name, the nuptial song: END
BEGIN NOW Io, ye Latian dames! if any here END
BEGIN NOW Hold your unhappy queen, Amata, dear; END
BEGIN NOW If there be here," she said, who dare maintain END
BEGIN NOW My right, nor think the name of mother vain; END
BEGIN NOW Unbind your fillets, loose your flowing hair, END
BEGIN NOW And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare. END
BEGIN NOW Amata's breast the Fury thus invades, END
BEGIN NOW And fires with rage, amid the sylvan shades; END
BEGIN NOW Then, when she found her venom spread so far, END
BEGIN NOW The royal house embroil'd in civil war, END
BEGIN NOW Rais'd on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies, END
BEGIN NOW And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies. END
BEGIN NOW His town, as fame reports, was built of old END
BEGIN NOW By Danae, pregnant with almighty gold, END
BEGIN NOW Who fled her father's rage, and, with a train END
BEGIN NOW Of following Argives, thro' the stormy main, END
BEGIN NOW Driv'n by the southern blasts, was fated here to reign. END
BEGIN NOW 'T was Ardua once; now Ardea's name it bears; END
BEGIN NOW Once a fair city, now consum'd with years. END
BEGIN NOW Here, in his lofty palace, Turnus lay, END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt the confines of the night and day, END
BEGIN NOW Secure in sleep. The Fury laid aside END
BEGIN NOW Her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried END
BEGIN NOW The foulness of th' infernal form to hide. END
BEGIN NOW Propp'd on a staff, she takes a trembling mien: END
BEGIN NOW Her face is furrow'd, and her front obscene; END
BEGIN NOW Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws; END
BEGIN NOW Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws; END
BEGIN NOW Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound, END
BEGIN NOW Her temples with an olive wreath are crown'd. END
BEGIN NOW Old Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane END
BEGIN NOW Of Juno, now she seem'd, and thus began, END
BEGIN NOW Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man: END
BEGIN NOW Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain END
BEGIN NOW In fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain? END
BEGIN NOW Win, for a Trojan head to wear the prize, END
BEGIN NOW Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories? END
BEGIN NOW The bride and scepter which thy blood has bought, END
BEGIN NOW The king transfers; and foreign heirs are sought. END
BEGIN NOW Go now, deluded man, and seek again END
BEGIN NOW New toils, new dangers, on the dusty plain. END
BEGIN NOW Repel the Tuscan foes; their city seize; END
BEGIN NOW Protect the Latians in luxurious ease. END
BEGIN NOW This dream all-pow'rful Juno sends; I bear END
BEGIN NOW Her mighty mandates, and her words you hear. END
BEGIN NOW Haste; arm your Ardeans; issue to the plain; END
BEGIN NOW With fate to friend, assault the Trojan train: END
BEGIN NOW Their thoughtless chiefs, their painted ships, that lie END
BEGIN NOW In Tiber's mouth, with fire and sword destroy. END
BEGIN NOW The Latian king, unless he shall submit, END
BEGIN NOW Own his old promise, and his new forget- END
BEGIN NOW Let him, in arms, the pow'r of Turnus prove, END
BEGIN NOW And learn to fear whom he disdains to love. END
BEGIN NOW For such is Heav'n's command." The youthful prince END
BEGIN NOW With scorn replied, and made this bold defense: END
BEGIN NOW You tell me, mother, what I knew before: END
BEGIN NOW The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore. END
BEGIN NOW I neither fear nor will provoke the war; END
BEGIN NOW My fate is Juno's most peculiar care. END
BEGIN NOW But time has made you dote, and vainly tell END
BEGIN NOW Of arms imagin'd in your lonely cell. END
BEGIN NOW Go; be the temple and the gods your care; END
BEGIN NOW Permit to men the thought of peace and war. END
BEGIN NOW These haughty words Alecto's rage provoke, END
BEGIN NOW And frighted Turnus trembled as she spoke. END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes grow stiffen'd, and with sulphur burn; END
BEGIN NOW Her hideous looks and hellish form return; END
BEGIN NOW Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place, END
BEGIN NOW And open all the furies of her face: END
BEGIN NOW Then, darting fire from her malignant eyes, END
BEGIN NOW She cast him backward as he strove to rise, END
BEGIN NOW And, ling'ring, sought to frame some new replies. END
BEGIN NOW High on her head she rears two twisted snakes, END
BEGIN NOW Her chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes; END
BEGIN NOW And, churning bloody foam, thus loudly speaks: END
BEGIN NOW Behold whom time has made to dote, and tell END
BEGIN NOW Of arms imagin'd in her lonely cell! END
BEGIN NOW Behold the Fates' infernal minister! END
BEGIN NOW War, death, destruction, in my hand I bear. END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, her smold'ring torch, impress'd END
BEGIN NOW With her full force, she plung'd into his breast. END
BEGIN NOW Aghast he wak'd; and, starting from his bed, END
BEGIN NOW Cold sweat, in clammy drops, his limbs o'erspread. END
BEGIN NOW Arms! arms!" he cries: "my sword and shield prepare! END
BEGIN NOW He breathes defiance, blood, and mortal war. END
BEGIN NOW So, when with crackling flames a caldron fries, END
BEGIN NOW The bubbling waters from the bottom rise: END
BEGIN NOW Above the brims they force their fiery way; END
BEGIN NOW Black vapors climb aloft, and cloud the day. END
BEGIN NOW The peace polluted thus, a chosen band END
BEGIN NOW He first commissions to the Latian land, END
BEGIN NOW In threat'ning embassy; then rais'd the rest, END
BEGIN NOW To meet in arms th' intruding Trojan guest, END
BEGIN NOW To force the foes from the Lavinian shore, END
BEGIN NOW And Italy's indanger'd peace restore. END
BEGIN NOW Himself alone an equal match he boasts, END
BEGIN NOW To fight the Phrygian and Ausonian hosts. END
BEGIN NOW The gods invok'd, the Rutuli prepare END
BEGIN NOW Their arms, and warn each other to the war. END
BEGIN NOW His beauty these, and those his blooming age, END
BEGIN NOW The rest his house and his own fame ingage. END
BEGIN NOW While Turnus urges thus his enterprise, END
BEGIN NOW The Stygian Fury to the Trojans flies; END
BEGIN NOW New frauds invents, and takes a steepy stand, END
BEGIN NOW Which overlooks the vale with wide command; END
BEGIN NOW Where fair Ascanius and his youthful train, END
BEGIN NOW With horns and hounds, a hunting match ordain, END
BEGIN NOW And pitch their toils around the shady plain. END
BEGIN NOW The Fury fires the pack; they snuff, they vent, END
BEGIN NOW And feed their hungry nostrils with the scent. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas of a well-grown stag, whose antlers rise END
BEGIN NOW High o'er his front; his beams invade the skies. END
BEGIN NOW From this light cause th' infernal maid prepares END
BEGIN NOW The country churls to mischief, hate, and wars. END
BEGIN NOW The stately beast the two Tyrrhidae bred, END
BEGIN NOW Snatch'd from his dams, and the tame youngling fed. END
BEGIN NOW Their father Tyrrheus did his fodder bring, END
BEGIN NOW Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian king: END
BEGIN NOW Their sister Silvia cherish'd with her care END
BEGIN NOW The little wanton, and did wreaths prepare END
BEGIN NOW To hang his budding horns, with ribbons tied END
BEGIN NOW His tender neck, and comb'd his silken hide, END
BEGIN NOW And bathed his body. Patient of command END
BEGIN NOW In time he grew, and, growing us'd to hand, END
BEGIN NOW He waited at his master's board for food; END
BEGIN NOW Then sought his salvage kindred in the wood, END
BEGIN NOW Where grazing all the day, at night he came END
BEGIN NOW To his known lodgings, and his country dame. END
BEGIN NOW This household beast, that us'd the woodland grounds, END
BEGIN NOW Was view'd at first by the young hero's hounds, END
BEGIN NOW As down the stream he swam, to seek retreat END
BEGIN NOW In the cool waters, and to quench his heat. END
BEGIN NOW Ascanius young, and eager of his game, END
BEGIN NOW Soon bent his bow, uncertain in his aim; END
BEGIN NOW But the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides, END
BEGIN NOW Which pierc'd his bowels thro' his panting sides. END
BEGIN NOW The bleeding creature issues from the floods, END
BEGIN NOW Possess'd with fear, and seeks his known abodes, END
BEGIN NOW His old familiar hearth and household gods. END
BEGIN NOW He falls; he fills the house with heavy groans, END
BEGIN NOW Implores their pity, and his pain bemoans. END
BEGIN NOW Young Silvia beats her breast, and cries aloud END
BEGIN NOW For succor from the clownish neighborhood: END
BEGIN NOW The churls assemble; for the fiend, who lay END
BEGIN NOW In the close woody covert, urg'd their way. END
BEGIN NOW One with a brand yet burning from the flame, END
BEGIN NOW Arm'd with a knotty club another came: END
BEGIN NOW Whate'er they catch or find, without their care, END
BEGIN NOW Their fury makes an instrument of war. END
BEGIN NOW Tyrrheus, the foster father of the beast, END
BEGIN NOW Then clench'd a hatchet in his horny fist, END
BEGIN NOW But held his hand from the descending stroke, END
BEGIN NOW And left his wedge within the cloven oak, END
BEGIN NOW To whet their courage and their rage provoke. END
BEGIN NOW And now the goddess, exercis'd in ill, END
BEGIN NOW Who watch'd an hour to work her impious will, END
BEGIN NOW Ascends the roof, and to her crooked horn, END
BEGIN NOW Such as was then by Latian shepherds borne, END
BEGIN NOW Adds all her breath: the rocks and woods around, END
BEGIN NOW And mountains, tremble at th' infernal sound. END
BEGIN NOW The sacred lake of Trivia from afar, END
BEGIN NOW The Veline fountains, and sulphureous Nar, END
BEGIN NOW Shake at the baleful blast, the signal of the war. END
BEGIN NOW Young mothers wildly stare, with fear possess'd, END
BEGIN NOW And strain their helpless infants to their breast. END
BEGIN NOW The clowns, a boist'rous, rude, ungovern'd crew, END
BEGIN NOW With furious haste to the loud summons flew. END
BEGIN NOW The pow'rs of Troy, then issuing on the plain, END
BEGIN NOW With fresh recruits their youthful chief sustain: END
BEGIN NOW Not theirs a raw and unexperienc'd train, END
BEGIN NOW But a firm body of embattled men. END
BEGIN NOW At first, while fortune favor'd neither side, END
BEGIN NOW The fight with clubs and burning brands was tried; END
BEGIN NOW But now, both parties reinforc'd, the fields END
BEGIN NOW Are bright with flaming swords and brazen shields. END
BEGIN NOW A shining harvest either host displays, END
BEGIN NOW And shoots against the sun with equal rays. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, when a black-brow'd gust begins to rise, END
BEGIN NOW White foam at first on the curl'd ocean fries; END
BEGIN NOW Then roars the main, the billows mount the skies; END
BEGIN NOW Till, by the fury of the storm full blown, END
BEGIN NOW The muddy bottom o'er the clouds is thrown. END
BEGIN NOW First Almon falls, old Tyrrheus' eldest care, END
BEGIN NOW Pierc'd with an arrow from the distant war: END
BEGIN NOW Fix'd in his throat the flying weapon stood, END
BEGIN NOW And stopp'd his breath, and drank his vital blood END
BEGIN NOW Huge heaps of slain around the body rise: END
BEGIN NOW Among the rest, the rich Galesus lies; END
BEGIN NOW A good old man, while peace he preach'd in vain, END
BEGIN NOW Amidst the madness of th' unruly train: END
BEGIN NOW Five herds, five bleating flocks, his pastures fill'd; END
BEGIN NOW His lands a hundred yoke of oxen till'd. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, while in equal scales their fortune stood END
BEGIN NOW The Fury bath'd them in each other's blood; END
BEGIN NOW Then, having fix'd the fight, exulting flies, END
BEGIN NOW And bears fulfill'd her promise to the skies. END
BEGIN NOW To Juno thus she speaks: "Behold! It is done, END
BEGIN NOW The blood already drawn, the war begun; END
BEGIN NOW The discord is complete; nor can they cease END
BEGIN NOW The dire debate, nor you command the peace. END
BEGIN NOW Now, since the Latian and the Trojan brood END
BEGIN NOW Have tasted vengeance and the sweets of blood; END
BEGIN NOW Speak, and my pow'r shall add this office more: END
BEGIN NOW The neighb'ing nations of th' Ausonian shore END
BEGIN NOW Shall hear the dreadful rumor, from afar, END
BEGIN NOW Of arm'd invasion, and embrace the war. END
BEGIN NOW Then Juno thus: "The grateful work is done, END
BEGIN NOW The seeds of discord sow'd, the war begun; END
BEGIN NOW Frauds, fears, and fury have possess'd the state, END
BEGIN NOW And fix'd the causes of a lasting hate. END
BEGIN NOW A bloody Hymen shall th' alliance join END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt the Trojan and Ausonian line: END
BEGIN NOW But thou with speed to night and hell repair; END
BEGIN NOW For not the gods, nor angry Jove, will bear END
BEGIN NOW Thy lawless wand'ring walks in upper air. END
BEGIN NOW Leave what remains to me." Saturnia said: END
BEGIN NOW The sullen fiend her sounding wings display'd, END
BEGIN NOW Unwilling left the light, and sought the nether shade. END
BEGIN NOW In midst of Italy, well known to fame, END
BEGIN NOW There lies a lake (Amsanctus is the name) END
BEGIN NOW Below the lofty mounts: on either side END
BEGIN NOW Thick forests the forbidden entrance hide. END
BEGIN NOW Full in the center of the sacred wood END
BEGIN NOW An arm arises of the Stygian flood, END
BEGIN NOW Which, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound, END
BEGIN NOW Whirls the black waves and rattling stones around. END
BEGIN NOW Here Pluto pants for breath from out his cell, END
BEGIN NOW And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell. END
BEGIN NOW To this infernal lake the Fury flies; END
BEGIN NOW Here hides her hated head, and frees the lab'ring skies. END
BEGIN NOW Saturnian Juno now, with double care, END
BEGIN NOW Attends the fatal process of the war. END
BEGIN NOW The clowns, return'd, from battle bear the slain, END
BEGIN NOW Implore the gods, and to their king complain. END
BEGIN NOW The corps of Almon and the rest are shown; END
BEGIN NOW Shrieks, clamors, murmurs, fill the frighted town. END
BEGIN NOW Ambitious Turnus in the press appears, END
BEGIN NOW And, aggravating crimes, augments their fears; END
BEGIN NOW Proclaims his private injuries aloud, END
BEGIN NOW A solemn promise made, and disavow'd; END
BEGIN NOW A foreign son is sought, and a mix'd mungril brood. END
BEGIN NOW Then they, whose mothers, frantic with their fear, END
BEGIN NOW In woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear, END
BEGIN NOW And lead his dances with dishevel'd hair, END
BEGIN NOW Increase the clamor, and the war demand, END
BEGIN NOW (Such was Amata's interest in the land,) END
BEGIN NOW Against the public sanctions of the peace, END
BEGIN NOW Against all omens of their ill success. END
BEGIN NOW With fates averse, the rout in arms resort, END
BEGIN NOW To force their monarch, and insult the court. END
BEGIN NOW But, like a rock unmov'd, a rock that braves END
BEGIN NOW The raging tempest and the rising waves- END
BEGIN NOW Propp'd on himself he stands; his solid sides END
BEGIN NOW Wash off the seaweeds, and the sounding tides- END
BEGIN NOW So stood the pious prince, unmov'd, and long END
BEGIN NOW Sustain'd the madness of the noisy throng. END
BEGIN NOW But, when he found that Juno's pow'r prevail'd, END
BEGIN NOW And all the methods of cool counsel fail'd, END
BEGIN NOW He calls the gods to witness their offense, END
BEGIN NOW Disclaims the war, asserts his innocence. END
BEGIN NOW Hurried by fate," he cries, "and borne before END
BEGIN NOW A furious wind, we have the faithful shore. END
BEGIN NOW O more than madmen! you yourselves shall bear END
BEGIN NOW The guilt of blood and sacrilegious war: END
BEGIN NOW Thou, Turnus, shalt atone it by thy fate, END
BEGIN NOW And pray to Heav'n for peace, but pray too late. END
BEGIN NOW For me, my stormy voyage at an end, END
BEGIN NOW I to the port of death securely tend. END
BEGIN NOW The fun'ral pomp which to your kings you pay, END
BEGIN NOW Is all I want, and all you take away. END
BEGIN NOW He said no more, but, in his walls confin'd, END
BEGIN NOW Shut out the woes which he too well divin'd END
BEGIN NOW Nor with the rising storm would vainly strive, END
BEGIN NOW But left the helm, and let the vessel drive. END
BEGIN NOW A solemn custom was observ'd of old, END
BEGIN NOW Which Latium held, and now the Romans hold, END
BEGIN NOW Their standard when in fighting fields they rear END
BEGIN NOW Against the fierce Hyrcanians, or declare END
BEGIN NOW The Scythian, Indian, or Arabian war; END
BEGIN NOW Or from the boasting Parthians would regain END
BEGIN NOW Their eagles, lost in Carrhae's bloody plain. END
BEGIN NOW Two gates of steel (the name of Mars they bear, END
BEGIN NOW And still are worship'd with religious fear) END
BEGIN NOW Before his temple stand: the dire abode, END
BEGIN NOW And the fear'd issues of the furious god, END
BEGIN NOW Are fenc'd with brazen bolts; without the gates, END
BEGIN NOW The wary guardian Janus doubly waits. END
BEGIN NOW Then, when the sacred senate votes the wars, END
BEGIN NOW The Roman consul their decree declares, END
BEGIN NOW And in his robes the sounding gates unbars. END
BEGIN NOW The youth in military shouts arise, END
BEGIN NOW And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies. END
BEGIN NOW These rites, of old by sov'reign princes us'd, END
BEGIN NOW Were the king's office; but the king refus'd, END
BEGIN NOW Deaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar END
BEGIN NOW Of sacred peace, or loose th' imprison'd war; END
BEGIN NOW But hid his head, and, safe from loud alarms, END
BEGIN NOW Abhorr'd the wicked ministry of arms. END
BEGIN NOW Then heav'n's imperious queen shot down from high: END
BEGIN NOW At her approach the brazen hinges fly; END
BEGIN NOW The gates are forc'd, and ev'ry falling bar; END
BEGIN NOW And, like a tempest, issues out the war. END
BEGIN NOW The peaceful cities of th' Ausonian shore, END
BEGIN NOW Lull'd in their ease, and undisturb'd before, END
BEGIN NOW Are all on fire; and some, with studious care, END
BEGIN NOW Their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare; END
BEGIN NOW Some their soft limbs in painful marches try, END
BEGIN NOW And war is all their wish, and arms the gen'ral cry. END
BEGIN NOW Part scour the rusty shields with seam; and part END
BEGIN NOW New grind the blunted ax, and point the dart: END
BEGIN NOW With joy they view the waving ensigns fly, END
BEGIN NOW And hear the trumpet's clangor pierce the sky. END
BEGIN NOW Five cities forge their arms: th' Atinian pow'rs, END
BEGIN NOW Antemnae, Tibur with her lofty tow'rs, END
BEGIN NOW Ardea the proud, the Crustumerian town: END
BEGIN NOW All these of old were places of renown. END
BEGIN NOW Some hammer helmets for the fighting field; END
BEGIN NOW Some twine young sallows to support the shield; END
BEGIN NOW The croslet some, and some the cuishes mold, END
BEGIN NOW With silver plated, and with ductile gold. END
BEGIN NOW The rustic honors of the scythe and share END
BEGIN NOW Give place to swords and plumes, the pride of war. END
BEGIN NOW Old fauchions are new temper'd in the fires; END
BEGIN NOW The sounding trumpet ev'ry soul inspires. END
BEGIN NOW The word is giv'n; with eager speed they lace END
BEGIN NOW The shining headpiece, and the shield embrace. END
BEGIN NOW The neighing steeds are to the chariot tied; END
BEGIN NOW The trusty weapon sits on ev'ry side. END
BEGIN NOW And now the mighty labor is begun END
BEGIN NOW Ye Muses, open all your Helicon. END
BEGIN NOW Sing you the chiefs that sway'd th' Ausonian land, END
BEGIN NOW Their arms, and armies under their command; END
BEGIN NOW What warriors in our ancient clime were bred; END
BEGIN NOW What soldiers follow'd, and what heroes led. END
BEGIN NOW For well you know, and can record alone, END
BEGIN NOW What fame to future times conveys but darkly down. END
BEGIN NOW Mezentius first appear'd upon the plain: END
BEGIN NOW Scorn sate upon his brows, and sour disdain, END
BEGIN NOW Defying earth and heav'n. Etruria lost, END
BEGIN NOW He brings to Turnus' aid his baffled host. END
BEGIN NOW The charming Lausus, full of youthful fire, END
BEGIN NOW Rode in the rank, and next his sullen sire; END
BEGIN NOW To Turnus only second in the grace END
BEGIN NOW Of manly mien, and features of the face. END
BEGIN NOW A skilful horseman, and a huntsman bred, END
BEGIN NOW With fates averse a thousand men he led: END
BEGIN NOW His sire unworthy of so brave a son; END
BEGIN NOW Himself well worthy of a happier throne. END
BEGIN NOW Next Aventinus drives his chariot round END
BEGIN NOW The Latian plains, with palms and laurels crown'd. END
BEGIN NOW Proud of his steeds, he smokes along the field; END
BEGIN NOW His father's hydra fills his ample shield: END
BEGIN NOW A hundred serpents hiss about the brims; END
BEGIN NOW The son of Hercules he justly seems END
BEGIN NOW By his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs; END
BEGIN NOW Of heav'nly part, and part of earthly blood, END
BEGIN NOW A mortal woman mixing with a god. END
BEGIN NOW For strong Alcides, after he had slain END
BEGIN NOW The triple Geryon, drove from conquer'd Spain END
BEGIN NOW His captive herds; and, thence in triumph led, END
BEGIN NOW On Tuscan Tiber's flow'ry banks they fed. END
BEGIN NOW The priestess Rhea found, and forc'd to love. END
BEGIN NOW For arms, his men long piles and jav'lins bore; END
BEGIN NOW And poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore. END
BEGIN NOW Like Hercules himself his son appears, END
BEGIN NOW In salvage pomp; a lion's hide he wears; END
BEGIN NOW About his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin; END
BEGIN NOW The teeth and gaping jaws severely grin. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, like the god his father, homely dress'd, END
BEGIN NOW He strides into the hall, a horrid guest. END
BEGIN NOW Then two twin brothers from fair Tibur came, END
BEGIN NOW (Which from their brother Tiburs took the name,) END
BEGIN NOW Fierce Coras and Catillus, void of fear: END
BEGIN NOW Arm'd Argive horse they led, and in the front appear. END
BEGIN NOW Like cloud-born Centaurs, from the mountain's height END
BEGIN NOW With rapid course descending to the fight; END
BEGIN NOW They rush along; the rattling woods give way; END
BEGIN NOW The branches bend before their sweepy sway. END
BEGIN NOW Nor was Praeneste's founder wanting there, END
BEGIN NOW Whom fame reports the son of Mulciber: END
BEGIN NOW Found in the fire, and foster'd in the plains, END
BEGIN NOW A shepherd and a king at once he reigns, END
BEGIN NOW And leads to Turnus' aid his country swains. END
BEGIN NOW His own Praeneste sends a chosen band, END
BEGIN NOW With those who plow Saturnia's Gabine land; END
BEGIN NOW Besides the succor which cold Anien yields, END
BEGIN NOW The rocks of Hernicus, and dewy fields, END
BEGIN NOW Anagnia fat, and Father Amasene- END
BEGIN NOW A num'rous rout, but all of naked men: END
BEGIN NOW Nor arms they wear, nor swords and bucklers wield, END
BEGIN NOW Nor drive the chariot thro' the dusty field, END
BEGIN NOW But whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead, END
BEGIN NOW And spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head; END
BEGIN NOW The left foot naked, when they march to fight, END
BEGIN NOW But in a bull's raw hide they sheathe the right. END
BEGIN NOW Messapus next, (great Neptune was his sire,) END
BEGIN NOW Secure of steel, and fated from the fire, END
BEGIN NOW In pomp appears, and with his ardor warms END
BEGIN NOW A heartless train, unexercis'd in arms: END
BEGIN NOW The just Faliscans he to battle brings, END
BEGIN NOW And those who live where Lake Ciminia springs; END
BEGIN NOW And where Feronia's grove and temple stands, END
BEGIN NOW Who till Fescennian or Flavinian lands. END
BEGIN NOW All these in order march, and marching sing END
BEGIN NOW The warlike actions of their sea-born king; END
BEGIN NOW Like a long team of snowy swans on high, END
BEGIN NOW Which clap their wings, and cleave the liquid sky, END
BEGIN NOW When, homeward from their wat'ry pastures borne, END
BEGIN NOW They sing, and Asia's lakes their notes return. END
BEGIN NOW Not one who heard their music from afar, END
BEGIN NOW Would think these troops an army train'd to war, END
BEGIN NOW But flocks of fowl, that, when the tempests roar, END
BEGIN NOW With their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore. END
BEGIN NOW Then Clausus came, who led a num'rous band END
BEGIN NOW Of troops embodied from the Sabine land, END
BEGIN NOW And, in himself alone, an army brought. END
BEGIN NOW 'T was he, the noble Claudian race begot, END
BEGIN NOW The Claudian race, ordain'd, in times to come, END
BEGIN NOW To share the greatness of imperial Rome. END
BEGIN NOW He led the Cures forth, of old renown, END
BEGIN NOW Mutuscans from their olive-bearing town, END
BEGIN NOW And all th' Eretian pow'rs; besides a band END
BEGIN NOW That follow'd from Velinum's dewy land, END
BEGIN NOW And Amiternian troops, of mighty fame, END
BEGIN NOW And mountaineers, that from Severus came, END
BEGIN NOW And from the craggy cliffs of Tetrica, END
BEGIN NOW And those where yellow Tiber takes his way, END
BEGIN NOW And where Himella's wanton waters play. END
BEGIN NOW Casperia sends her arms, with those that lie END
BEGIN NOW By Fabaris, and fruitful Foruli: END
BEGIN NOW The warlike aids of Horta next appear, END
BEGIN NOW And the cold Nursians come to close the rear, END
BEGIN NOW Mix'd with the natives born of Latine blood, END
BEGIN NOW Whom Allia washes with her fatal flood. END
BEGIN NOW Not thicker billows beat the Libyan main, END
BEGIN NOW When pale Orion sets in wintry rain; END
BEGIN NOW Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise, END
BEGIN NOW Or Lycian fields, when Phoebus burns the skies, END
BEGIN NOW Than stand these troops: their bucklers ring around; END
BEGIN NOW Their trampling turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground. END
BEGIN NOW High in his chariot then Halesus came, END
BEGIN NOW A foe by birth to Troy's unhappy name: END
BEGIN NOW From Agamemnon born- to Turnus' aid END
BEGIN NOW A thousand men the youthful hero led, END
BEGIN NOW Who till the Massic soil, for wine renown'd, END
BEGIN NOW And fierce Auruncans from their hilly ground, END
BEGIN NOW And those who live by Sidicinian shores, END
BEGIN NOW And where with shoaly fords Vulturnus roars, END
BEGIN NOW Cales' and Osca's old inhabitants, END
BEGIN NOW And rough Saticulans, inur'd to wants: END
BEGIN NOW Light demi-lances from afar they throw, END
BEGIN NOW Fasten'd with leathern thongs, to gall the foe. END
BEGIN NOW Short crooked swords in closer fight they wear; END
BEGIN NOW And on their warding arm light bucklers bear. END
BEGIN NOW Nor Oebalus, shalt thou be left unsung, END
BEGIN NOW From nymph Semethis and old Telon sprung, END
BEGIN NOW Who then in Teleboan Capri reign'd; END
BEGIN NOW But that short isle th' ambitious youth disdain'd, END
BEGIN NOW And o'er Campania stretch'd his ample sway, END
BEGIN NOW Where swelling Sarnus seeks the Tyrrhene sea; END
BEGIN NOW O'er Batulum, and where Abella sees, END
BEGIN NOW From her high tow'rs, the harvest of her trees. END
BEGIN NOW And these (as was the Teuton use of old) END
BEGIN NOW Wield brazen swords, and brazen bucklers hold; END
BEGIN NOW Sling weighty stones, when from afar they fight; END
BEGIN NOW Their casques are cork, a covering thick and light. END
BEGIN NOW Next these in rank, the warlike Ufens went, END
BEGIN NOW And led the mountain troops that Nursia sent. END
BEGIN NOW The rude Equicolae his rule obey'd; END
BEGIN NOW Hunting their sport, and plund'ring was their trade. END
BEGIN NOW In arms they plow'd, to battle still prepar'd: END
BEGIN NOW Their soil was barren, and their hearts were hard. END
BEGIN NOW Umbro the priest the proud Marrubians led, END
BEGIN NOW By King Archippus sent to Turnus' aid, END
BEGIN NOW And peaceful olives crown'd his hoary head. END
BEGIN NOW His wand and holy words, the viper's rage, END
BEGIN NOW And venom'd wounds of serpents could assuage. END
BEGIN NOW He, when he pleas'd with powerful juice to steep END
BEGIN NOW Their temples, shut their eyes in pleasing sleep. END
BEGIN NOW But vain were Marsian herbs, and magic art, END
BEGIN NOW To cure the wound giv'n by the Dardan dart: END
BEGIN NOW Yet his untimely fate th' Angitian woods END
BEGIN NOW In sighs remurmur'd to the Fucine floods. END
BEGIN NOW The son of fam'd Hippolytus was there, END
BEGIN NOW Fam'd as his sire, and, as his mother, fair; END
BEGIN NOW Whom in Egerian groves Aricia bore, END
BEGIN NOW And nurs'd his youth along the marshy shore, END
BEGIN NOW Where great Diana's peaceful altars flame, END
BEGIN NOW In fruitful fields; and Virbius was his name. END
BEGIN NOW Hippolytus, as old records have said, END
BEGIN NOW Was by his stepdam sought to share her bed; END
BEGIN NOW But, when no female arts his mind could move, END
BEGIN NOW She turn'd to furious hate her impious love. END
BEGIN NOW Torn by wild horses on the sandy shore, END
BEGIN NOW Another's crimes th' unhappy hunter bore, END
BEGIN NOW Glutting his father's eyes with guiltless gore. END
BEGIN NOW But chaste Diana, who his death deplor'd, END
BEGIN NOW With Aesculapian herbs his life restor'd. END
BEGIN NOW Then Jove, who saw from high, with just disdain, END
BEGIN NOW The dead inspir'd with vital breath again, END
BEGIN NOW Struck to the center, with his flaming dart, END
BEGIN NOW Th' unhappy founder of the godlike art. END
BEGIN NOW But Trivia kept in secret shades alone END
BEGIN NOW Her care, Hippolytus, to fate unknown; END
BEGIN NOW And call'd him Virbius in th' Egerian grove, END
BEGIN NOW Where then he liv'd obscure, but safe from Jove. END
BEGIN NOW For this, from Trivia's temple and her wood END
BEGIN NOW Are coursers driv'n, who shed their master's blood, END
BEGIN NOW Affrighted by the monsters of the flood. END
BEGIN NOW His son, the second Virbius, yet retain'd END
BEGIN NOW His father's art, and warrior steeds he rein'd. END
BEGIN NOW Amid the troops, and like the leading god, END
BEGIN NOW High o'er the rest in arms the graceful Turnus rode: END
BEGIN NOW A triple of plumes his crest adorn'd, END
BEGIN NOW On which with belching flames Chimaera burn'd: END
BEGIN NOW The more the kindled combat rises high'r, END
BEGIN NOW The more with fury burns the blazing fire. END
BEGIN NOW Fair Io grac'd his shield; but Io now END
BEGIN NOW With horns exalted stands, and seems to low- END
BEGIN NOW A noble charge! Her keeper by her side, END
BEGIN NOW To watch her walks, his hundred eyes applied; END
BEGIN NOW And on the brims her sire, the wat'ry god, END
BEGIN NOW Roll'd from a silver urn his crystal flood. END
BEGIN NOW A cloud of foot succeeds, and fills the fields END
BEGIN NOW With swords, and pointed spears, and clatt'ring shields; END
BEGIN NOW Of Argives, and of old Sicanian bands, END
BEGIN NOW And those who plow the rich Rutulian lands; END
BEGIN NOW Auruncan youth, and those Sacrana yields, END
BEGIN NOW And the proud Labicans, with painted shields, END
BEGIN NOW And those who near Numician streams reside, END
BEGIN NOW And those whom Tiber's holy forests hide, END
BEGIN NOW Or Circe's hills from the main land divide; END
BEGIN NOW Where Ufens glides along the lowly lands, END
BEGIN NOW Or the black water of Pomptina stands. END
BEGIN NOW Last, from the Volscians fair Camilla came, END
BEGIN NOW And led her warlike troops, a warrior dame; END
BEGIN NOW Unbred to spinning, in the loom unskill'd, END
BEGIN NOW She chose the nobler Pallas of the field. END
BEGIN NOW Mix'd with the first, the fierce virago fought, END
BEGIN NOW Sustain'd the toils of arms, the danger sought, END
BEGIN NOW Outstripp'd the winds in speed upon the plain, END
BEGIN NOW Flew o'er the fields, nor hurt the bearded grain: END
BEGIN NOW She swept the seas, and, as she skimm'd along, END
BEGIN NOW Her flying feet unbath'd on billows hung. END
BEGIN NOW Men, boys, and women, stupid with surprise, END
BEGIN NOW Where'er she passes, fix their wond'ring eyes: END
BEGIN NOW Longing they look, and, gaping at the sight, END
BEGIN NOW Devour her o'er and o'er with vast delight; END
BEGIN NOW Her purple habit sits with such a grace END
BEGIN NOW On her smooth shoulders, and so suits her face; END
BEGIN NOW Her head with ringlets of her hair is crown'd, END
BEGIN NOW And in a golden caul the curls are bound. END
BEGIN NOW She shakes her myrtle jav'lin; and, behind, END
BEGIN NOW Her Lycian quiver dances in the wind. END
BEGIN NOW When Turnus had assembled all his pow'rs, END
BEGIN NOW His standard planted on Laurentum's tow'rs; END
BEGIN NOW When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar, END
BEGIN NOW Had giv'n the signal of approaching war, END
BEGIN NOW Had rous'd the neighing steeds to scour the fields, END
BEGIN NOW While the fierce riders clatter'd on their shields; END
BEGIN NOW Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare END
BEGIN NOW To join th' allies, and headlong rush to war. END
BEGIN NOW Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd, END
BEGIN NOW With bold Mezentius, who blasphem'd aloud. END
BEGIN NOW These thro' the country took their wasteful course, END
BEGIN NOW The fields to forage, and to gather force. END
BEGIN NOW Then Venulus to Diomede they send, END
BEGIN NOW To beg his aid Ausonia to defend, END
BEGIN NOW Declare the common danger, and inform END
BEGIN NOW The Grecian leader of the growing storm: END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas, landed on the Latian coast, END
BEGIN NOW With banish'd gods, and with a baffled host, END
BEGIN NOW Yet now aspir'd to conquest of the state, END
BEGIN NOW And claim'd a title from the gods and fate; END
BEGIN NOW What num'rous nations in his quarrel came, END
BEGIN NOW And how they spread his formidable name. END
BEGIN NOW What he design'd, what mischief might arise, END
BEGIN NOW If fortune favor'd his first enterprise, END
BEGIN NOW Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears, END
BEGIN NOW And common interest, was involv'd in theirs. END
BEGIN NOW While Turnus and th' allies thus urge the war, END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan, floating in a flood of care, END
BEGIN NOW Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare. END
BEGIN NOW This way and that he turns his anxious mind; END
BEGIN NOW Thinks, and rejects the counsels he design'd; END
BEGIN NOW Explores himself in vain, in ev'ry part, END
BEGIN NOW And gives no rest to his distracted heart. END
BEGIN NOW So, when the sun by day, or moon by night, END
BEGIN NOW Strike on the polish'd brass their trembling light, END
BEGIN NOW The glitt'ring species here and there divide, END
BEGIN NOW And cast their dubious beams from side to side; END
BEGIN NOW Now on the walls, now on the pavement play, END
BEGIN NOW And to the ceiling flash the glaring day. END
BEGIN NOW 'T was night; and weary nature lull'd asleep END
BEGIN NOW The birds of air, and fishes of the deep, END
BEGIN NOW And beasts, and mortal men. The Trojan chief END
BEGIN NOW Was laid on Tiber's banks, oppress'd with grief, END
BEGIN NOW And found in silent slumber late relief. END
BEGIN NOW Then, thro' the shadows of the poplar wood, END
BEGIN NOW Arose the father of the Roman flood; END
BEGIN NOW An azure robe was o'er his body spread, END
BEGIN NOW A wreath of shady reeds adorn'd his head: END
BEGIN NOW Thus, manifest to sight, the god appear'd, END
BEGIN NOW And with these pleasing words his sorrow cheer'd: END
BEGIN NOW Undoubted offspring of ethereal race, END
BEGIN NOW O long expected in this promis'd place! END
BEGIN NOW Who thro' the foes hast borne thy banish'd gods, END
BEGIN NOW Restor'd them to their hearths, and old abodes; END
BEGIN NOW This is thy happy home, the clime where fate END
BEGIN NOW Ordains thee to restore the Trojan state. END
BEGIN NOW Fear not! The war shall end in lasting peace, END
BEGIN NOW And all the rage of haughty Juno cease. END
BEGIN NOW And that this nightly vision may not seem END
BEGIN NOW Th' effect of fancy, or an idle dream, END
BEGIN NOW A sow beneath an oak shall lie along, END
BEGIN NOW All white herself, and white her thirty young. END
BEGIN NOW When thirty rolling years have run their race, END
BEGIN NOW Thy son Ascanius, on this empty space, END
BEGIN NOW Shall build a royal town, of lasting fame, END
BEGIN NOW Which from this omen shall receive the name. END
BEGIN NOW Time shall approve the truth. For what remains, END
BEGIN NOW And how with sure success to crown thy pains, END
BEGIN NOW With patience next attend. A banish'd band, END
BEGIN NOW Driv'n with Evander from th' Arcadian land, END
BEGIN NOW Have planted here, and plac'd on high their walls; END
BEGIN NOW Their town the founder Pallanteum calls, END
BEGIN NOW Deriv'd from Pallas, his great-grandsire's name: END
BEGIN NOW But the fierce Latians old possession claim, END
BEGIN NOW With war infesting the new colony. END
BEGIN NOW These make thy friends, and on their aid rely. END
BEGIN NOW To thy free passage I submit my streams. END
BEGIN NOW Wake, son of Venus, from thy pleasing dreams; END
BEGIN NOW And, when the setting stars are lost in day, END
BEGIN NOW To Juno's pow'r thy just devotion pay; END
BEGIN NOW With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease: END
BEGIN NOW Her pride at length shall fall, her fury cease. END
BEGIN NOW When thou return'st victorious from the war, END
BEGIN NOW Perform thy vows to me with grateful care. END
BEGIN NOW The god am I, whose yellow water flows END
BEGIN NOW Around these fields, and fattens as it goes: END
BEGIN NOW Tiber my name; among the rolling floods END
BEGIN NOW Renown'd on earth, esteem'd among the gods. END
BEGIN NOW This is my certain seat. In times to come, END
BEGIN NOW My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and plung'd below. While yet he spoke, END
BEGIN NOW His dream Aeneas and his sleep forsook. END
BEGIN NOW He rose, and looking up, beheld the skies END
BEGIN NOW With purple blushing, and the day arise. END
BEGIN NOW Then water in his hollow palm he took END
BEGIN NOW From Tiber's flood, and thus the pow'rs bespoke: END
BEGIN NOW Laurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed, END
BEGIN NOW And Father Tiber, in thy sacred bed END
BEGIN NOW Receive Aeneas, and from danger keep. END
BEGIN NOW Whatever fount, whatever holy deep, END
BEGIN NOW Conceals thy wat'ry stores; where'er they rise, END
BEGIN NOW And, bubbling from below, salute the skies; END
BEGIN NOW Thou, king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn END
BEGIN NOW Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn, END
BEGIN NOW For this thy kind compassion of our woes, END
BEGIN NOW Shalt share my morning song and ev'ning vows. END
BEGIN NOW But, O be present to thy people's aid, END
BEGIN NOW And firm the gracious promise thou hast made! END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, two galleys from his stores, END
BEGIN NOW With care he chooses, mans, and fits with oars. END
BEGIN NOW Now on the shore the fatal swine is found. END
BEGIN NOW Wondrous to tell!- She lay along the ground: END
BEGIN NOW Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung; END
BEGIN NOW She white herself, and white her thirty young. END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas takes the mother and her brood, END
BEGIN NOW And all on Juno's altar are bestow'd. END
BEGIN NOW The foll'wing night, and the succeeding day, END
BEGIN NOW Propitious Tiber smooth'd his wat'ry way: END
BEGIN NOW He roll'd his river back, and pois'd he stood, END
BEGIN NOW A gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojans mount their ships; they put from shore, END
BEGIN NOW Borne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar. END
BEGIN NOW Shouts from the land give omen to their course, END
BEGIN NOW And the pitch'd vessels glide with easy force. END
BEGIN NOW The woods and waters wonder at the gleam END
BEGIN NOW Of shields, and painted ships that stem the stream. END
BEGIN NOW One summer's night and one whole day they pass END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass. END
BEGIN NOW The fiery sun had finish'd half his race, END
BEGIN NOW Look'd back, and doubted in the middle space, END
BEGIN NOW When they from far beheld the rising tow'rs, END
BEGIN NOW The tops of sheds, and shepherds' lowly bow'rs, END
BEGIN NOW Thin as they stood, which, then of homely clay, END
BEGIN NOW Now rise in marble, from the Roman sway. END
BEGIN NOW These cots (Evander's kingdom, mean and poor) END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan saw, and turn'd his ships to shore. END
BEGIN NOW 'T was on a solemn day: th' Arcadian states, END
BEGIN NOW The king and prince, without the city gates, END
BEGIN NOW Then paid their off'rings in a sacred grove END
BEGIN NOW To Hercules, the warrior son of Jove. END
BEGIN NOW Thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies, END
BEGIN NOW And fat of entrails on his altar fries. END
BEGIN NOW But, when they saw the ships that stemm'd the flood, END
BEGIN NOW And glitter'd thro' the covert of the wood, END
BEGIN NOW They rose with fear, and left th' unfinish'd feast, END
BEGIN NOW Till dauntless Pallas reassur'd the rest END
BEGIN NOW To pay the rites. Himself without delay END
BEGIN NOW A jav'lin seiz'd, and singly took his way; END
BEGIN NOW Then gain'd a rising ground, and call'd from far: END
BEGIN NOW Resolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are; END
BEGIN NOW Your bus'ness here; and bring you peace or war? END
BEGIN NOW High on the stern Aeneas his stand, END
BEGIN NOW And held a branch of olive in his hand, END
BEGIN NOW While thus he spoke: "The Phrygians' arms you see, END
BEGIN NOW Expell'd from Troy, provok'd in Italy END
BEGIN NOW By Latian foes, with war unjustly made; END
BEGIN NOW At first affianc'd, and at last betray'd. END
BEGIN NOW This message bear: 'The Trojans and their chief END
BEGIN NOW Bring holy peace, and beg the king's relief.' END
BEGIN NOW Struck with so great a name, and all on fire, END
BEGIN NOW The youth replies: "Whatever you require, END
BEGIN NOW Your fame exacts. Upon our shores descend. END
BEGIN NOW A welcome guest, and, what you wish, a friend. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and, downward hasting to the strand, END
BEGIN NOW Embrac'd the stranger prince, and join'd his hand. END
BEGIN NOW Conducted to the grove, Aeneas broke END
BEGIN NOW The silence first, and thus the king bespoke: END
BEGIN NOW Best of the Greeks, to whom, by fate's command, END
BEGIN NOW I bear these peaceful branches in my hand, END
BEGIN NOW Undaunted I approach you, tho' I know END
BEGIN NOW Your birth is Grecian, and your land my foe; END
BEGIN NOW From Atreus tho' your ancient lineage came, END
BEGIN NOW And both the brother kings your kindred claim; END
BEGIN NOW Yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown, END
BEGIN NOW Your virtue, thro' the neighb'ring nations blown, END
BEGIN NOW Our fathers' mingled blood, Apollo's voice, END
BEGIN NOW Have led me hither, less by need than choice. END
BEGIN NOW Our founder Dardanus, as fame has sung, END
BEGIN NOW And Greeks acknowledge, from Electra sprung: END
BEGIN NOW Electra from the loins of Atlas came; END
BEGIN NOW Atlas, whose head sustains the starry frame. END
BEGIN NOW Your sire is Mercury, whom long before END
BEGIN NOW On cold Cyllene's top fair Maia bore. END
BEGIN NOW Maia the fair, on fame if we rely, END
BEGIN NOW Was Atlas' daughter, who sustains the sky. END
BEGIN NOW Thus from one common source our streams divide; END
BEGIN NOW Ours is the Trojan, yours th' Areadian side. END
BEGIN NOW Rais'd by these hopes, I sent no news before, END
BEGIN NOW Nor ask'd your leave, nor did your faith implore; END
BEGIN NOW But come, without a pledge, my own ambassador. END
BEGIN NOW The same Rutulians, who with arms pursue END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan race, are equal foes to you. END
BEGIN NOW Our host expell'd, what farther force can stay END
BEGIN NOW The victor troops from universal sway? END
BEGIN NOW Then will they stretch their pow'r athwart the land, END
BEGIN NOW And either sea from side to side command. END
BEGIN NOW Receive our offer'd faith, and give us thine; END
BEGIN NOW Ours is a gen'rous and experienc'd line: END
BEGIN NOW We want not hearts nor bodies for the war; END
BEGIN NOW In council cautious, and in fields we dare. END
BEGIN NOW He said; and while spoke, with piercing eyes END
BEGIN NOW Evander view'd the man with vast surprise, END
BEGIN NOW Pleas'd with his action, ravish'd with his face: END
BEGIN NOW Then answer'd briefly, with a royal grace: END
BEGIN NOW O valiant leader of the Trojan line, END
BEGIN NOW In whom the features of thy father shine, END
BEGIN NOW How I recall Anchises! how I see END
BEGIN NOW His motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee! END
BEGIN NOW Long tho' it be, 't is fresh within my mind, END
BEGIN NOW When Priam to his sister's court design'd END
BEGIN NOW A welcome visit, with a friendly stay, END
BEGIN NOW And thro' th' Arcadian kingdom took his way. END
BEGIN NOW Then, past a boy, the callow down began END
BEGIN NOW To shade my chin, and call me first a man. END
BEGIN NOW I saw the shining train with vast delight, END
BEGIN NOW And Priam's goodly person pleas'd my sight: END
BEGIN NOW But great Anchises, far above the rest, END
BEGIN NOW With awful wonder fir'd my youthful breast. END
BEGIN NOW I long'd to join in friendship's holy bands END
BEGIN NOW Our mutual hearts, and plight our mutual hands. END
BEGIN NOW I first accosted him: I sued, I sought, END
BEGIN NOW And, with a loving force, to Pheneus brought. END
BEGIN NOW He gave me, when at length constrain'd to go, END
BEGIN NOW A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow, END
BEGIN NOW A vest embroider'd, glorious to behold, END
BEGIN NOW And two rich bridles, with their bits of gold, END
BEGIN NOW Which my son's coursers in obedience hold. END
BEGIN NOW The league you ask, I offer, as your right; END
BEGIN NOW And, when to-morrow's sun reveals the light, END
BEGIN NOW With swift supplies you shall be sent away. END
BEGIN NOW Now celebrate with us this solemn day, END
BEGIN NOW Whose holy rites admit no long delay. END
BEGIN NOW Honor our annual feast; and take your seat, END
BEGIN NOW With friendly welcome, at a homely treat. END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, the bowls (remov'd for fear) END
BEGIN NOW The youths replac'd, and soon restor'd the cheer. END
BEGIN NOW On sods of turf he set the soldiers round: END
BEGIN NOW A maple throne, rais'd higher from the ground, END
BEGIN NOW Receiv'd the Trojan chief; and, o'er the bed, END
BEGIN NOW A lion's shaggy hide for ornament they spread. END
BEGIN NOW The loaves were serv'd in canisters; the wine END
BEGIN NOW In bowls; the priest renew'd the rites divine: END
BEGIN NOW Broil'd entrails are their food, and beef's continued chine. END
BEGIN NOW But when the rage of hunger was repress'd, END
BEGIN NOW Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest: END
BEGIN NOW These rites, these altars, and this feast, O king, END
BEGIN NOW From no vain fears or superstition spring, END
BEGIN NOW Or blind devotion, or from blinder chance, END
BEGIN NOW Or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance; END
BEGIN NOW But, sav'd from danger, with a grateful sense, END
BEGIN NOW The labors of a god we recompense. END
BEGIN NOW See, from afar, yon rock that mates the sky, END
BEGIN NOW About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie; END
BEGIN NOW Such indigested ruin; bleak and bare, END
BEGIN NOW How desart now it stands, expos'd in air! END
BEGIN NOW 'T was once a robber's den, inclos'd around END
BEGIN NOW With living stone, and deep beneath the ground. END
BEGIN NOW The monster Cacus, more than half a beast, END
BEGIN NOW This hold, impervious to the sun, possess'd. END
BEGIN NOW The pavement ever foul with human gore; END
BEGIN NOW Heads, and their mangled members, hung the door. END
BEGIN NOW Vulcan this plague begot; and, like his sire, END
BEGIN NOW Black clouds he belch'd, and flakes of livid fire. END
BEGIN NOW Time, long expected, eas'd us of our load, END
BEGIN NOW And brought the needful presence of a god. END
BEGIN NOW Th' avenging force of Hercules, from Spain, END
BEGIN NOW Arriv'd in triumph, from Geryon slain: END
BEGIN NOW Thrice liv'd the giant, and thrice liv'd in vain. END
BEGIN NOW His prize, the lowing herds, Alcides drove END
BEGIN NOW Near Tiber's bank, to graze the shady grove. END
BEGIN NOW Allur'd with hope of plunder, and intent END
BEGIN NOW By force to rob, by fraud to circumvent, END
BEGIN NOW The brutal Cacus, as by chance they stray'd, END
BEGIN NOW Four oxen thence, and four fair kine convey'd; END
BEGIN NOW And, lest the printed footsteps might be seen, END
BEGIN NOW He dragg'd 'em backwards to his rocky den. END
BEGIN NOW The tracks averse a lying notice gave, END
BEGIN NOW And led the searcher backward from the cave. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place, END
BEGIN NOW To find fresh pasture and untrodden grass. END
BEGIN NOW The beasts, who miss'd their mates, fill'd all around END
BEGIN NOW With bellowings, and the rocks restor'd the sound. END
BEGIN NOW One heifer, who had heard her love complain, END
BEGIN NOW Roar'd from the cave, and made the project vain. END
BEGIN NOW Alcides found the fraud; with rage he shook, END
BEGIN NOW And toss'd about his head his knotted oak. END
BEGIN NOW Swift as the winds, or Scythian arrows' flight, END
BEGIN NOW He clomb, with eager haste, th' aerial height. END
BEGIN NOW Then first we saw the monster mend his pace; END
BEGIN NOW Fear his eyes, and paleness in his face, END
BEGIN NOW Confess'd the god's approach. Trembling he springs, END
BEGIN NOW As terror had increas'd his feet with wings; END
BEGIN NOW Nor stay'd for stairs; but down the depth he threw END
BEGIN NOW His body, on his back the door he drew END
BEGIN NOW (The door, a rib of living rock; with pains END
BEGIN NOW His father hew'd it out, and bound with iron chains): END
BEGIN NOW He broke the heavy links, the mountain clos'd, END
BEGIN NOW And bars and levers to his foe oppos'd. END
BEGIN NOW The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast; END
BEGIN NOW The fierce avenger came with bounding haste; END
BEGIN NOW Survey'd the mouth of the forbidden hold, END
BEGIN NOW And here and there his raging eyes he roll'd. END
BEGIN NOW He gnash'd his teeth; and thrice he compass'd round END
BEGIN NOW With winged speed the circuit of the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Thrice at the cavern's mouth he pull'd in vain, END
BEGIN NOW And, panting, thrice desisted from his pain. END
BEGIN NOW A pointed flinty rock, all bare and black, END
BEGIN NOW Grew gibbous from behind the mountain's back; END
BEGIN NOW Owls, ravens, all ill omens of the night, END
BEGIN NOW Here built their nests, and hither wing'd their flight. END
BEGIN NOW The leaning head hung threat'ning o'er the flood, END
BEGIN NOW And nodded to the left. The hero stood END
BEGIN NOW Adverse, with planted feet, and, from the right, END
BEGIN NOW Tugg'd at the solid stone with all his might. END
BEGIN NOW Thus heav'd, the fix'd foundations of the rock END
BEGIN NOW Gave way; heav'n echo'd at the rattling shock. END
BEGIN NOW Tumbling, it chok'd the flood: on either side END
BEGIN NOW The banks leap backward, and the streams divide; END
BEGIN NOW The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread, END
BEGIN NOW And trembling Tiber div'd beneath his bed. END
BEGIN NOW The court of Cacus stands reveal'd to sight; END
BEGIN NOW The cavern glares with new-admitted light. END
BEGIN NOW So the pent vapors, with a rumbling sound, END
BEGIN NOW Heave from below, and rend the hollow ground; END
BEGIN NOW A sounding flaw succeeds; and, from on high, END
BEGIN NOW The gods with hate beheld the nether sky: END
BEGIN NOW The ghosts repine at violated night, END
BEGIN NOW And curse th' invading sun, and sicken at the sight. END
BEGIN NOW The graceless monster, caught in open day, END
BEGIN NOW Inclos'd, and in despair to fly away, END
BEGIN NOW Howls horrible from underneath, and fills END
BEGIN NOW His hollow palace with unmanly yells. END
BEGIN NOW The hero stands above, and from afar END
BEGIN NOW Plies him with darts, and stones, and distant war. END
BEGIN NOW He, from his nostrils huge mouth, expires END
BEGIN NOW Black clouds of smoke, amidst his father's fires, END
BEGIN NOW Gath'ring, with each repeated blast, the night, END
BEGIN NOW To make uncertain aim, and erring sight. END
BEGIN NOW The wrathful god then plunges from above, END
BEGIN NOW And, where in thickest waves the sparkles drove, END
BEGIN NOW There lights; and wades thro' fumes, and gropes his way, END
BEGIN NOW Half sing'd, half stifled, till he grasps his prey. END
BEGIN NOW The monster, spewing fruitless flames, he found; END
BEGIN NOW He squeez'd his throat; he writh'd his neck around, END
BEGIN NOW And in a knot his crippled members bound; END
BEGIN NOW Then from their sockets tore his burning eyes: END
BEGIN NOW Roll'd on a heap, the breathless robber lies. END
BEGIN NOW The doors, unbarr'd, receive the rushing day, END
BEGIN NOW And thoro' lights disclose the ravish'd prey. END
BEGIN NOW The bulls, redeem'd, breathe open air again. END
BEGIN NOW Next, by the feet, they drag him from his den. END
BEGIN NOW The wond'ring neighborhood, with glad surprise, END
BEGIN NOW Behold his shagged breast, his giant size, END
BEGIN NOW His mouth that flames no more, and his extinguish'd eyes. END
BEGIN NOW From that auspicious day, with rites divine, END
BEGIN NOW We worship at the hero's holy shrine. END
BEGIN NOW Potitius first ordain'd these annual vows: END
BEGIN NOW As priests, were added the Pinarian house, END
BEGIN NOW Who rais'd this altar in the sacred shade, END
BEGIN NOW Where honors, ever due, for ever shall be paid. END
BEGIN NOW For these deserts, and this high virtue shown, END
BEGIN NOW Ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown: END
BEGIN NOW Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood, END
BEGIN NOW And with deep draughts invoke our common god. END
BEGIN NOW This said, a double wreath Evander twin'd, END
BEGIN NOW And poplars black and white his temples bind. END
BEGIN NOW Then brims his ample bowl. With like design END
BEGIN NOW The rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime the sun descended from the skies, END
BEGIN NOW And the bright evening star began to rise. END
BEGIN NOW And now the priests, Potitius at their head, END
BEGIN NOW In skins of beasts involv'd, the long procession led; END
BEGIN NOW Held high the flaming tapers in their hands, END
BEGIN NOW As custom had prescrib'd their holy bands; END
BEGIN NOW Then with a second course the tables load, END
BEGIN NOW And with full chargers offer to the god. END
BEGIN NOW The Salii sing, and cense his altars round END
BEGIN NOW With Saban smoke, their heads with poplar bound- END
BEGIN NOW One choir of old, another of the young, END
BEGIN NOW To dance, and bear the burthen of the song. END
BEGIN NOW The lay records the labors, and the praise, END
BEGIN NOW And all th' immortal acts of Hercules: END
BEGIN NOW First, how the mighty babe, when swath'd in bands, END
BEGIN NOW The serpents strangled with his infant hands; END
BEGIN NOW Then, as in years and matchless force he grew, END
BEGIN NOW Th' Oechalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, a thousand hazards they relate, END
BEGIN NOW Procur'd by Juno's and Eurystheus' hate: END
BEGIN NOW Thy hands, unconquer'd hero, could subdue END
BEGIN NOW The cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew: END
BEGIN NOW Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood, END
BEGIN NOW Nor he, the roaring terror of the wood. END
BEGIN NOW The triple porter of the Stygian seat, END
BEGIN NOW With lolling tongue, lay fawning at thy feet, END
BEGIN NOW And, seiz'd with fear, forgot his mangled meat. END
BEGIN NOW Th' infernal waters trembled at thy sight; END
BEGIN NOW Thee, god, no face of danger could affright; END
BEGIN NOW Not huge Typhoeus, nor th' unnumber'd snake, END
BEGIN NOW Increas'd with hissing heads, in Lerna's lake. END
BEGIN NOW Hail, Jove's undoubted son! an added grace END
BEGIN NOW To heav'n and the great author of thy race! END
BEGIN NOW Receive the grateful off'rings which we pay, END
BEGIN NOW And smile propitious on thy solemn day! END
BEGIN NOW In numbers thus they sung; above the rest, END
BEGIN NOW The den and death of Cacus crown the feast. END
BEGIN NOW The woods to hollow vales convey the sound, END
BEGIN NOW The vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound. END
BEGIN NOW The rites perform'd, the cheerful train retire. END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire, END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan pass'd, the city to survey, END
BEGIN NOW And pleasing talk beguil'd the tedious way. END
BEGIN NOW The stranger cast around his curious eyes, END
BEGIN NOW New objects viewing still, with new surprise; END
BEGIN NOW With greedy joy enquires of various things, END
BEGIN NOW And acts and monuments of ancient kings. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus the founder of the Roman tow'rs: END
BEGIN NOW These woods were first the seat of sylvan pow'rs, END
BEGIN NOW Of Nymphs and Fauns, and salvage men, who took END
BEGIN NOW Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak. END
BEGIN NOW Nor laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care END
BEGIN NOW Of lab'ring oxen, or the shining share, END
BEGIN NOW Nor arts of gain, nor what they gain'd to spare. END
BEGIN NOW Their exercise the chase; the running flood END
BEGIN NOW Supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food. END
BEGIN NOW Then Saturn came, who fled the pow'r of Jove, END
BEGIN NOW Robb'd of his realms, and banish'd from above. END
BEGIN NOW The men, dispers'd on hills, to towns he brought, END
BEGIN NOW And laws ordain'd, and civil customs taught, END
BEGIN NOW And Latium call'd the land where safe he lay END
BEGIN NOW From his unduteous son, and his usurping sway. END
BEGIN NOW With his mild empire, peace and plenty came; END
BEGIN NOW And hence the golden times deriv'd their name. END
BEGIN NOW A more degenerate and discolor'd age END
BEGIN NOW Succeeded this, with avarice and rage. END
BEGIN NOW Th' Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians came; END
BEGIN NOW And Saturn's empire often chang'd the name. END
BEGIN NOW Then kings, gigantic Tybris, and the rest, END
BEGIN NOW With arbitrary sway the land oppress'd: END
BEGIN NOW For Tiber's flood was Albula before, END
BEGIN NOW Till, from the tyrant's fate, his name it bore. END
BEGIN NOW I last arriv'd, driv'n from my native home END
BEGIN NOW By fortune's pow'r, and fate's resistless doom. END
BEGIN NOW Long toss'd on seas, I sought this happy land, END
BEGIN NOW Warn'd by my mother nymph, and call'd by Heav'n's command. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, walking on, he spoke, and shew'd the gate, END
BEGIN NOW Since call'd Carmental by the Roman state; END
BEGIN NOW Where stood an altar, sacred to the name END
BEGIN NOW Of old Carmenta, the prophetic dame, END
BEGIN NOW Who to her son foretold th' Aenean race, END
BEGIN NOW Sublime in fame, and Rome's imperial place: END
BEGIN NOW Then shews the forest, which, in after times, END
BEGIN NOW Fierce Romulus for perpetrated crimes END
BEGIN NOW A sacred refuge made; with this, the shrine END
BEGIN NOW Where Pan below the rock had rites divine: END
BEGIN NOW Then tells of Argus' death, his murder'd guest, END
BEGIN NOW Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest. END
BEGIN NOW Thence, to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads; END
BEGIN NOW Now roof'd with gold, then thatch'd with homely reeds. END
BEGIN NOW A reverent fear (such superstition reigns END
BEGIN NOW Among the rude) ev'n then possess'd the swains. END
BEGIN NOW Some god, they knew- what god, they could not tell- END
BEGIN NOW Did there amidst the sacred horror dwell. END
BEGIN NOW Th' Arcadians thought him Jove; and said they saw END
BEGIN NOW The mighty Thund'rer with majestic awe, END
BEGIN NOW Who took his shield, and dealt his bolts around, END
BEGIN NOW And scatter'd tempests on the teeming ground. END
BEGIN NOW Then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood END
BEGIN NOW Two stately towns, on either side the flood,) END
BEGIN NOW Saturnia's and Janicula's remains; END
BEGIN NOW And either place the founder's name retains. END
BEGIN NOW Discoursing thus together, they resort END
BEGIN NOW Where poor Evander kept his country court. END
BEGIN NOW They view'd the ground of Rome's litigious hall; END
BEGIN NOW (Once oxen low'd, where now the lawyers bawl;) END
BEGIN NOW Then, stooping, thro' the narrow gate they press'd, END
BEGIN NOW When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest: END
BEGIN NOW Mean as it is, this palace, and this door, END
BEGIN NOW Receiv'd Alcides, then a conqueror. END
BEGIN NOW Dare to be poor; accept our homely food, END
BEGIN NOW Which feasted him, and emulate a god. END
BEGIN NOW Then underneath a lowly roof he led END
BEGIN NOW The weary prince, and laid him on a bed; END
BEGIN NOW The stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o'erspread. END
BEGIN NOW Now Night had shed her silver dews around, END
BEGIN NOW And with her sable wings embrac'd the ground, END
BEGIN NOW When love's fair goddess, anxious for her son, END
BEGIN NOW (New tumults rising, and new wars begun,) END
BEGIN NOW Couch'd with her husband in his golden bed, END
BEGIN NOW With these alluring words invokes his aid; END
BEGIN NOW And, that her pleasing speech his mind may move, END
BEGIN NOW Inspires each accent with the charms of love: END
BEGIN NOW While cruel fate conspir'd with Grecian pow'rs, END
BEGIN NOW To level with the ground the Trojan tow'rs, END
BEGIN NOW I ask'd not aid th' unhappy to restore, END
BEGIN NOW Nor did the succor of thy skill implore; END
BEGIN NOW Nor urg'd the labors of my lord in vain, END
BEGIN NOW A sinking empire longer to sustain, END
BEGIN NOW Tho'much I ow'd to Priam's house, and more END
BEGIN NOW The dangers of Aeneas did deplore. END
BEGIN NOW But now, by Jove's command, and fate's decree, END
BEGIN NOW His race is doom'd to reign in Italy: END
BEGIN NOW With humble suit I beg thy needful art, END
BEGIN NOW O still propitious pow'r, that rules my heart! END
BEGIN NOW A mother kneels a suppliant for her son. END
BEGIN NOW By Thetis and Aurora thou wert won END
BEGIN NOW To forge impenetrable shields, and grace END
BEGIN NOW With fated arms a less illustrious race. END
BEGIN NOW Behold, what haughty nations are combin'd END
BEGIN NOW Against the relics of the Phrygian kind, END
BEGIN NOW With fire and sword my people to destroy, END
BEGIN NOW And conquer Venus twice, in conqu'ring Troy. END
BEGIN NOW She said; and straight her arms, of snowy hue, END
BEGIN NOW About her unresolving husband threw. END
BEGIN NOW Her soft embraces soon infuse desire; END
BEGIN NOW His bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire; END
BEGIN NOW And all the godhead feels the wonted fire. END
BEGIN NOW Not half so swift the rattling thunder flies, END
BEGIN NOW Or forky lightnings flash along the skies. END
BEGIN NOW The goddess, proud of her successful wiles, END
BEGIN NOW And conscious of her form, in secret smiles. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus the pow'r, obnoxious to her charms, END
BEGIN NOW Panting, and half dissolving in her arms: END
BEGIN NOW Why seek you reasons for a cause so just, END
BEGIN NOW Or your own beauties or my love distrust? END
BEGIN NOW Long since, had you requir'd my helpful hand, END
BEGIN NOW Th' artificer and art you might command, END
BEGIN NOW To labor arms for Troy: nor Jove, nor fate, END
BEGIN NOW Confin'd their empire to so short a date. END
BEGIN NOW And, if you now desire new wars to wage, END
BEGIN NOW My skill I promise, and my pains engage. END
BEGIN NOW Whatever melting metals can conspire, END
BEGIN NOW Or breathing bellows, or the forming fire, END
BEGIN NOW Is freely yours: your anxious fears remove, END
BEGIN NOW And think no task is difficult to love. END
BEGIN NOW Trembling he spoke; and, eager of her charms, END
BEGIN NOW He snatch'd the willing goddess to his arms; END
BEGIN NOW Till in her lap infus'd, he lay possess'd END
BEGIN NOW Of full desire, and sunk to pleasing rest. END
BEGIN NOW Now when the Night her middle race had rode, END
BEGIN NOW And his first slumber had refresh'd the god- END
BEGIN NOW The time when early housewives leave the bed; END
BEGIN NOW When living embers on the hearth they spread, END
BEGIN NOW Supply the lamp, and call the maids to rise- END
BEGIN NOW With yawning mouths, and with half-open'd eyes, END
BEGIN NOW They ply the distaff by the winking light, END
BEGIN NOW And to their daily labor add the night: END
BEGIN NOW Thus frugally they earn their children's bread, END
BEGIN NOW And uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed- END
BEGIN NOW Not less concern'd, nor at a later hour, END
BEGIN NOW Rose from his downy couch the forging pow'r. END
BEGIN NOW Sacred to Vulcan's name, an isle there lay, END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt Sicilia's coasts and Lipare, END
BEGIN NOW Rais'd high on smoking rocks; and, deep below, END
BEGIN NOW In hollow caves the fires of Aetna glow. END
BEGIN NOW The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal; END
BEGIN NOW Loud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel, END
BEGIN NOW Are heard around; the boiling waters roar, END
BEGIN NOW And smoky flames thro' fuming tunnels soar. END
BEGIN NOW Hether the Father of the Fire, by night, END
BEGIN NOW Thro' the brown air precipitates his flight. END
BEGIN NOW On their eternal anvils here he found END
BEGIN NOW The brethren beating, and the blows go round. END
BEGIN NOW A load of pointless thunder now there lies END
BEGIN NOW Before their hands, to ripen for the skies: END
BEGIN NOW These darts, for angry Jove, they daily cast; END
BEGIN NOW Consum'd on mortals with prodigious waste. END
BEGIN NOW Three rays of writhen rain, of fire three more, END
BEGIN NOW Of winged southern winds and cloudy store END
BEGIN NOW As many parts, the dreadful mixture frame; END
BEGIN NOW And fears are added, and avenging flame. END
BEGIN NOW Inferior ministers, for Mars, repair END
BEGIN NOW His broken axletrees and blunted war, END
BEGIN NOW And send him forth again with furbish'd arms, END
BEGIN NOW To wake the lazy war with trumpets' loud alarms. END
BEGIN NOW The rest refresh the scaly snakes that fold END
BEGIN NOW The shield of Pallas, and renew their gold. END
BEGIN NOW Full on the crest the Gorgon's head they place, END
BEGIN NOW With eyes that roll in death, and with distorted face. END
BEGIN NOW My sons," said Vulcan, "set your tasks aside; END
BEGIN NOW Your strength and master-skill must now be tried. END
BEGIN NOW Arms for a hero forge; arms that require END
BEGIN NOW Your force, your speed, and all your forming fire. END
BEGIN NOW He said. They set their former work aside, END
BEGIN NOW And their new toils with eager haste divide. END
BEGIN NOW A flood of molten silver, brass, and gold, END
BEGIN NOW And deadly steel, in the large furnace roll'd; END
BEGIN NOW Of this, their artful hands a shield prepare, END
BEGIN NOW Alone sufficient to sustain the war. END
BEGIN NOW Sev'n orbs within a spacious round they close: END
BEGIN NOW One stirs the fire, and one the bellows blows. END
BEGIN NOW The hissing steel is in the smithy drown'd; END
BEGIN NOW The grot with beaten anvils groans around. END
BEGIN NOW By turns their arms advance, in equal time; END
BEGIN NOW By turns their hands descend, and hammers chime. END
BEGIN NOW They turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs; END
BEGIN NOW The fiery work proceeds, with rustic songs. END
BEGIN NOW While, at the Lemnian god's command, they urge END
BEGIN NOW Their labors thus, and ply th' Aeolian forge, END
BEGIN NOW The cheerful morn salutes Evander's eyes, END
BEGIN NOW And songs of chirping birds invite to rise. END
BEGIN NOW He leaves his lowly bed: his buskins meet END
BEGIN NOW Above his ankles; sandals sheathe his feet: END
BEGIN NOW He sets his trusty sword upon his side, END
BEGIN NOW And o'er his shoulder throws a panther's hide. END
BEGIN NOW Two menial dogs before their master press'd. END
BEGIN NOW Thus clad, and guarded thus, he seeks his kingly guest. END
BEGIN NOW Mindful of promis'd aid, he mends his pace, END
BEGIN NOW But meets Aeneas in the middle space. END
BEGIN NOW Young Pallas did his father's steps attend, END
BEGIN NOW And true Achates waited on his friend. END
BEGIN NOW They join their hands; a secret seat they choose; END
BEGIN NOW Th' Arcadian first their former talk renews: END
BEGIN NOW Undaunted prince, I never can believe END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan empire lost, while you survive. END
BEGIN NOW Command th' assistance of a faithful friend; END
BEGIN NOW But feeble are the succors I can send. END
BEGIN NOW Our narrow kingdom here the Tiber bounds; END
BEGIN NOW That other side the Latian state surrounds, END
BEGIN NOW Insults our walls, and wastes our fruitful grounds. END
BEGIN NOW But mighty nations I prepare, to join END
BEGIN NOW Their arms with yours, and aid your just design. END
BEGIN NOW You come, as by your better genius sent, END
BEGIN NOW And fortune seems to favor your intent. END
BEGIN NOW Not far from hence there stands a hilly town, END
BEGIN NOW Of ancient building, and of high renown, END
BEGIN NOW Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race, END
BEGIN NOW Who gave the name of Caere to the place, END
BEGIN NOW Once Agyllina call'd. It flourish'd long, END
BEGIN NOW In pride of wealth and warlike people strong, END
BEGIN NOW Till curs'd Mezentius, in a fatal hour, END
BEGIN NOW Assum'd the crown, with arbitrary pow'r. END
BEGIN NOW What words can paint those execrable times, END
BEGIN NOW The subjects' suff'rings, and the tyrant's crimes! END
BEGIN NOW That blood, those murthers, O ye gods, replace END
BEGIN NOW On his own head, and on his impious race! END
BEGIN NOW The living and the dead at his command END
BEGIN NOW Were coupled, face to face, and hand to hand, END
BEGIN NOW Till, chok'd with stench, in loath'd embraces tied, END
BEGIN NOW The ling'ring wretches pin'd away and died. END
BEGIN NOW Thus plung'd in ills, and meditating more- END
BEGIN NOW The people's patience, tir'd, no longer bore END
BEGIN NOW The raging monster; but with arms beset END
BEGIN NOW His house, and vengeance and destruction threat. END
BEGIN NOW They fire his palace: while the flame ascends, END
BEGIN NOW They force his guards, and execute his friends. END
BEGIN NOW He cleaves the crowd, and, favor'd by the night, END
BEGIN NOW To Turnus' friendly court directs his flight. END
BEGIN NOW By just revenge the Tuscans set on fire, END
BEGIN NOW With arms, their king to punishment require: END
BEGIN NOW Their num'rous troops, now muster'd on the strand, END
BEGIN NOW My counsel shall submit to your command. END
BEGIN NOW Their navy swarms upon the coasts; they cry END
BEGIN NOW To hoist their anchors, but the gods deny. END
BEGIN NOW An ancient augur, skill'd in future fate, END
BEGIN NOW With these foreboding words restrains their hate: END
BEGIN NOW 'Ye brave in arms, ye Lydian blood, the flow'r END
BEGIN NOW Of Tuscan youth, and choice of all their pow'r, END
BEGIN NOW Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms, END
BEGIN NOW To seek your tyrant's death by lawful arms; END
BEGIN NOW Know this: no native of our land may lead END
BEGIN NOW This pow'rful people; seek a foreign head.' END
BEGIN NOW Aw'd with these words, in camps they still abide, END
BEGIN NOW And wait with longing looks their promis'd guide. END
BEGIN NOW Tarchon, the Tuscan chief, to me has sent END
BEGIN NOW Their crown, and ev'ry regal ornament: END
BEGIN NOW The people join their own with his desire; END
BEGIN NOW And all my conduct, as their king, require. END
BEGIN NOW But the chill blood that creeps within my veins, END
BEGIN NOW And age, and listless limbs unfit for pains, END
BEGIN NOW And a soul conscious of its own decay, END
BEGIN NOW Have forc'd me to refuse imperial sway. END
BEGIN NOW My Pallas were more fit to mount the throne, END
BEGIN NOW And should, but he's a Sabine mother's son, END
BEGIN NOW And half a native; but, in you, combine END
BEGIN NOW A manly vigor, and a foreign line. END
BEGIN NOW Where Fate and smiling Fortune shew the way, END
BEGIN NOW Pursue the ready path to sov'reign sway. END
BEGIN NOW The staff of my declining days, my son, END
BEGIN NOW Shall make your good or ill success his own; END
BEGIN NOW In fighting fields from you shall learn to dare, END
BEGIN NOW And serve the hard apprenticeship of war; END
BEGIN NOW Your matchless courage and your conduct view, END
BEGIN NOW And early shall begin t' admire and copy you. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, two hundred horse he shall command; END
BEGIN NOW Tho' few, a warlike and well-chosen band. END
BEGIN NOW These in my name are listed; and my son END
BEGIN NOW As many more has added in his own. END
BEGIN NOW Scarce had he said; Achates and his guest, END
BEGIN NOW With downcast eyes, their silent grief express'd; END
BEGIN NOW Who, short of succors, and in deep despair, END
BEGIN NOW Shook at the dismal prospect of the war. END
BEGIN NOW But his bright mother, from a breaking cloud, END
BEGIN NOW To cheer her issue, thunder'd thrice aloud; END
BEGIN NOW Thrice forky lightning flash'd along the sky, END
BEGIN NOW And Tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high. END
BEGIN NOW Then, gazing up, repeated peals they hear; END
BEGIN NOW And, in a heav'n serene, refulgent arms appear: END
BEGIN NOW Redd'ning the skies, and glitt'ring all around, END
BEGIN NOW The temper'd metals clash, and yield a silver sound. END
BEGIN NOW The rest stood trembling, struck with awe divine; END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas only, conscious to the sign, END
BEGIN NOW Presag'd th' event, and joyful view'd, above, END
BEGIN NOW Th' accomplish'd promise of the Queen of Love. END
BEGIN NOW Then, to th' Arcadian king: "This prodigy END
BEGIN NOW (Dismiss your fear) belongs alone to me. END
BEGIN NOW Heav'n calls me to the war: th' expected sign END
BEGIN NOW Is giv'n of promis'd aid, and arms divine. END
BEGIN NOW My goddess mother, whose indulgent care END
BEGIN NOW Foresaw the dangers of the growing war, END
BEGIN NOW This omen gave, when bright Vulcanian arms, END
BEGIN NOW Fated from force of steel by Stygian charms, END
BEGIN NOW Suspended, shone on high: she then foreshow'd END
BEGIN NOW Approaching fights, and fields to float in blood. END
BEGIN NOW Turnus shall dearly pay for faith forsworn; END
BEGIN NOW And corps, and swords, and shields, on Tiber borne, END
BEGIN NOW Shall choke his flood: now sound the loud alarms; END
BEGIN NOW And, Latian troops, prepare your perjur'd arms. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and, rising from his homely throne, END
BEGIN NOW The solemn rites of Hercules begun, END
BEGIN NOW And on his altars wak'd the sleeping fires; END
BEGIN NOW Then cheerful to his household gods retires; END
BEGIN NOW There offers chosen sheep. Th' Arcadian king END
BEGIN NOW And Trojan youth the same oblations bring. END
BEGIN NOW Next, of his men and ships he makes review; END
BEGIN NOW Draws out the best and ablest of the crew. END
BEGIN NOW Down with the falling stream the refuse run, END
BEGIN NOW To raise with joyful news his drooping son. END
BEGIN NOW Steeds are prepar'd to mount the Trojan band, END
BEGIN NOW Who wait their leader to the Tyrrhene land. END
BEGIN NOW A sprightly courser, fairer than the rest, END
BEGIN NOW The king himself presents his royal guest: END
BEGIN NOW A lion's hide his back and limbs infold, END
BEGIN NOW Precious with studded work, and paws of gold. END
BEGIN NOW Fame thro' the little city spreads aloud END
BEGIN NOW Th' intended march, amid the fearful crowd: END
BEGIN NOW The matrons beat their breasts, dissolve in tears, END
BEGIN NOW And double their devotion in their fears. END
BEGIN NOW The war at hand appears with more affright, END
BEGIN NOW And rises ev'ry moment to the sight. END
BEGIN NOW Then old Evander, with a close embrace, END
BEGIN NOW Strain'd his departing friend; and tears o'erflow his face. END
BEGIN NOW Would Heav'n," said he, "my strength and youth recall, END
BEGIN NOW Such as I was beneath Praeneste's wall; END
BEGIN NOW Then when I made the foremost foes retire, END
BEGIN NOW And set whole heaps of conquer'd shields on fire; END
BEGIN NOW When Herilus in single fight I slew, END
BEGIN NOW Whom with three lives Feronia did endue; END
BEGIN NOW And thrice I sent him to the Stygian shore, END
BEGIN NOW Till the last ebbing soul return'd no more- END
BEGIN NOW Such if I stood renew'd, not these alarms, END
BEGIN NOW Nor death, should rend me from my Pallas' arms; END
BEGIN NOW Nor proud Mezentius, thus unpunish'd, boast END
BEGIN NOW His rapes and murthers on the Tuscan coast. END
BEGIN NOW Ye gods, and mighty Jove, in pity bring END
BEGIN NOW Relief, and hear a father and a king! END
BEGIN NOW If fate and you reserve these eyes, to see END
BEGIN NOW My son return with peace and victory; END
BEGIN NOW If the lov'd boy shall bless his father's sight; END
BEGIN NOW If we shall meet again with more delight; END
BEGIN NOW Then draw my life in length; let me sustain, END
BEGIN NOW In hopes of his embrace, the worst of pain. END
BEGIN NOW But if your hard decrees- which, O! I dread- END
BEGIN NOW Have doom'd to death his undeserving head; END
BEGIN NOW This, O this very moment, let me die! END
BEGIN NOW While hopes and fears in equal balance lie; END
BEGIN NOW While, yet possess'd of all his youthful charms, END
BEGIN NOW I strain him close within these aged arms; END
BEGIN NOW Before that fatal news my soul shall wound! END
BEGIN NOW He said, and, swooning, sunk upon the ground. END
BEGIN NOW His servants bore him off, and softly laid END
BEGIN NOW His languish'd limbs upon his homely bed. END
BEGIN NOW The horsemen march; the gates are open'd wide; END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas at their head, Achates by his side. END
BEGIN NOW Next these, the Trojan leaders rode along; END
BEGIN NOW Last follows in the rear th' Arcadian throng. END
BEGIN NOW Young Pallas shone conspicuous o'er the rest; END
BEGIN NOW Gilded his arms, embroider'd was his vest. END
BEGIN NOW So, from the seas, exerts his radiant head END
BEGIN NOW The star by whom the lights of heav'n are led; END
BEGIN NOW Shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews, END
BEGIN NOW Dispels the darkness, and the day renews. END
BEGIN NOW The trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd, END
BEGIN NOW And follow, with their eyes, the dusty cloud, END
BEGIN NOW Which winds disperse by fits, and shew from far END
BEGIN NOW The blaze of arms, and shields, and shining war. END
BEGIN NOW The troops, drawn up in beautiful array, END
BEGIN NOW O'er heathy plains pursue the ready way. END
BEGIN NOW Repeated peals of shouts are heard around; END
BEGIN NOW The neighing coursers answer to the sound, END
BEGIN NOW And shake with horny hoofs the solid ground. END
BEGIN NOW A greenwood shade, for long religion known, END
BEGIN NOW Stands by the streams that wash the Tuscan town, END
BEGIN NOW Incompass'd round with gloomy hills above, END
BEGIN NOW Which add a holy horror to the grove. END
BEGIN NOW The first inhabitants of Grecian blood, END
BEGIN NOW That sacred forest to Silvanus vow'd, END
BEGIN NOW The guardian of their flocks and fields; and pay END
BEGIN NOW Their due devotions on his annual day. END
BEGIN NOW Not far from hence, along the river's side, END
BEGIN NOW In tents secure, the Tuscan troops abide, END
BEGIN NOW By Tarchon led. Now, from a rising ground, END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas cast his wond'ring eyes around, END
BEGIN NOW And all the Tyrrhene army had in sight, END
BEGIN NOW Stretch'd on the spacious plain from left to right. END
BEGIN NOW Thether his warlike train the Trojan led, END
BEGIN NOW Refresh'd his men, and wearied horses fed. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime the mother goddess, crown'd with charms, END
BEGIN NOW Breaks thro' the clouds, and brings the fated arms. END
BEGIN NOW Within a winding vale she finds her son, END
BEGIN NOW On the cool river's banks, retir'd alone. END
BEGIN NOW She shews her heav'nly form without disguise, END
BEGIN NOW And gives herself to his desiring eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Behold, she said, "perform'd in ev'ry part, END
BEGIN NOW My promise made, and Vulcan's labor'd art. END
BEGIN NOW Now seek, secure, the Latian enemy, END
BEGIN NOW And haughty Turnus to the field defy. END
BEGIN NOW She said; and, having first her son embrac'd, END
BEGIN NOW The radiant arms beneath an oak she plac'd, END
BEGIN NOW Proud of the gift, he roll'd his greedy sight END
BEGIN NOW Around the work, and gaz'd with vast delight. END
BEGIN NOW He lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires END
BEGIN NOW The crested helm, that vomits radiant fires: END
BEGIN NOW His hands the fatal sword and corslet hold, END
BEGIN NOW One keen with temper'd steel, one stiff with gold: END
BEGIN NOW Both ample, flaming both, and beamy bright; END
BEGIN NOW So shines a cloud, when edg'd with adverse light. END
BEGIN NOW He shakes the pointed spear, and longs to try END
BEGIN NOW The plated cuishes on his manly thigh; END
BEGIN NOW But most admires the shield's mysterious mold, END
BEGIN NOW And Roman triumphs rising on the gold: END
BEGIN NOW For these, emboss'd, the heav'nly smith had wrought END
BEGIN NOW (Not in the rolls of future fate untaught) END
BEGIN NOW The wars in order, and the race divine END
BEGIN NOW Of warriors issuing from the Julian line. END
BEGIN NOW The cave of Mars was dress'd with mossy greens: END
BEGIN NOW There, by the wolf, were laid the martial twins. END
BEGIN NOW Intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung; END
BEGIN NOW The foster dam loll'd out her fawning tongue: END
BEGIN NOW They suck'd secure, while, bending back her head, END
BEGIN NOW She lick'd their tender limbs, and form'd them as they fed. END
BEGIN NOW Not far from thence new Rome appears, with games END
BEGIN NOW Projected for the rape of Sabine dames. END
BEGIN NOW The pit resounds with shrieks; a war succeeds, END
BEGIN NOW For breach of public faith, and unexampled deeds. END
BEGIN NOW Here for revenge the Sabine troops contend; END
BEGIN NOW The Romans there with arms the prey defend. END
BEGIN NOW Wearied with tedious war, at length they cease; END
BEGIN NOW And both the kings and kingdoms plight the peace. END
BEGIN NOW The friendly chiefs before Jove's altar stand, END
BEGIN NOW Both arm'd, with each a charger in his hand: END
BEGIN NOW A fatted sow for sacrifice is led, END
BEGIN NOW With imprecations on the perjur'd head. END
BEGIN NOW Near this, the traitor Metius, stretch'd between END
BEGIN NOW Four fiery steeds, is dragg'd along the green, END
BEGIN NOW By Tullus' doom: the brambles drink his blood, END
BEGIN NOW And his torn limbs are left the vulture's food. END
BEGIN NOW There, Porsena to Rome proud Tarquin brings, END
BEGIN NOW And would by force restore the banish'd kings. END
BEGIN NOW One tyrant for his fellow-tyrant fights; END
BEGIN NOW The Roman youth assert their native rights. END
BEGIN NOW Before the town the Tuscan army lies, END
BEGIN NOW To win by famine, or by fraud surprise. END
BEGIN NOW Their king, half-threat'ning, half-disdaining stood, END
BEGIN NOW While Cocles broke the bridge, and stemm'd the flood. END
BEGIN NOW The captive maids there tempt the raging tide, END
BEGIN NOW Scap'd from their chains, with Cloelia for their guide. END
BEGIN NOW High on a rock heroic Manlius stood, END
BEGIN NOW To guard the temple, and the temple's god. END
BEGIN NOW Then Rome was poor; and there you might behold END
BEGIN NOW The palace thatch'd with straw, now roof'd with gold. END
BEGIN NOW The silver goose before the shining gate END
BEGIN NOW There flew, and, by her cackle, sav'd the state. END
BEGIN NOW She told the Gauls' approach; th' approaching Gauls, END
BEGIN NOW Obscure in night, ascend, and seize the walls. END
BEGIN NOW The gold dissembled well their yellow hair, END
BEGIN NOW And golden chains on their white necks they wear. END
BEGIN NOW Gold are their vests; long Alpine spears they wield, END
BEGIN NOW And their left arm sustains a length of shield. END
BEGIN NOW Hard by, the leaping Salian priests advance; END
BEGIN NOW And naked thro' the streets the mad Luperci dance, END
BEGIN NOW In caps of wool; the targets dropp'd from heav'n. END
BEGIN NOW Here modest matrons, in soft litters driv'n, END
BEGIN NOW To pay their vows in solemn pomp appear, END
BEGIN NOW And odorous gums in their chaste hands they bear. END
BEGIN NOW Far hence remov'd, the Stygian seats are seen; END
BEGIN NOW Pains of the damn'd, and punish'd Catiline END
BEGIN NOW Hung on a rock- the traitor; and, around, END
BEGIN NOW The Furies hissing from the nether ground. END
BEGIN NOW Apart from these, the happy souls he draws, END
BEGIN NOW And Cato's holy ghost dispensing laws. END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt the quarters flows a golden sea; END
BEGIN NOW But foaming surges there in silver play. END
BEGIN NOW The dancing dolphins with their tails divide END
BEGIN NOW The glitt'ring waves, and cut the precious tide. END
BEGIN NOW Amid the main, two mighty fleets engage END
BEGIN NOW Their brazen beaks, oppos'd with equal rage. END
BEGIN NOW Actium surveys the well-disputed prize; END
BEGIN NOW Leucate's wat'ry plain with foamy billows fries. END
BEGIN NOW Young Caesar, on the stern, in armor bright, END
BEGIN NOW Here leads the Romans and their gods to fight: END
BEGIN NOW His beamy temples shoot their flames afar, END
BEGIN NOW And o'er his head is hung the Julian star. END
BEGIN NOW Agrippa seconds him, with prosp'rous gales, END
BEGIN NOW And, with propitious gods, his foes assails: END
BEGIN NOW A naval crown, that binds his manly brows, END
BEGIN NOW The happy fortune of the fight foreshows. END
BEGIN NOW Rang'd on the line oppos'd, Antonius brings END
BEGIN NOW Barbarian aids, and troops of Eastern kings; END
BEGIN NOW Th' Arabians near, and Bactrians from afar, END
BEGIN NOW Of tongues discordant, and a mingled war: END
BEGIN NOW And, rich in gaudy robes, amidst the strife, END
BEGIN NOW Moving they fight; with oars and forky prows END
BEGIN NOW The froth is gather'd, and the water glows. END
BEGIN NOW It seems, as if the Cyclades again END
BEGIN NOW Were rooted up, and justled in the main; END
BEGIN NOW Or floating mountains floating mountains meet; END
BEGIN NOW Such is the fierce encounter of the fleet. END
BEGIN NOW Fireballs are thrown, and pointed jav'lins fly; END
BEGIN NOW The fields of Neptune take a purple dye. END
BEGIN NOW The queen herself, amidst the loud alarms, END
BEGIN NOW With cymbals toss'd her fainting soldiers warms- END
BEGIN NOW Fool as she was! who had not yet divin'd END
BEGIN NOW Her cruel fate, nor saw the snakes behind. END
BEGIN NOW Her country gods, the monsters of the sky, END
BEGIN NOW Great Neptune, Pallas, and Love's Queen defy: END
BEGIN NOW The dog Anubis barks, but barks in vain, END
BEGIN NOW Nor longer dares oppose th' ethereal train. END
BEGIN NOW Mars in the middle of the shining shield END
BEGIN NOW Is grav'd, and strides along the liquid field. END
BEGIN NOW The Dirae souse from heav'n with swift descent; END
BEGIN NOW And Discord, dyed in blood, with garments rent, END
BEGIN NOW Divides the prease: her steps Bellona treads, END
BEGIN NOW And shakes her iron rod above their heads. END
BEGIN NOW This seen, Apollo, from his Actian height, END
BEGIN NOW Pours down his arrows; at whose winged flight END
BEGIN NOW And soft Sabaeans quit the wat'ry field. END
BEGIN NOW The fatal mistress hoists her silken sails, END
BEGIN NOW And, shrinking from the fight, invokes the gales. END
BEGIN NOW Aghast she looks, and heaves her breast for breath, END
BEGIN NOW Panting, and pale with fear of future death. END
BEGIN NOW The god had figur'd her as driv'n along END
BEGIN NOW By winds and waves, and scudding thro' the throng. END
BEGIN NOW Just opposite, sad Nilus opens wide END
BEGIN NOW His arms and ample bosom to the tide, END
BEGIN NOW And spreads his mantle o'er the winding coast, END
BEGIN NOW In which he wraps his queen, and hides the flying host. END
BEGIN NOW The victor to the gods his thanks express'd, END
BEGIN NOW And Rome, triumphant, with his presence bless'd. END
BEGIN NOW Three hundred temples in the town he plac'd; END
BEGIN NOW With spoils and altars ev'ry temple grac'd. END
BEGIN NOW Three shining nights, and three succeeding days, END
BEGIN NOW The fields resound with shouts, the streets with praise, END
BEGIN NOW The domes with songs, the theaters with plays. END
BEGIN NOW All altars flame: before each altar lies, END
BEGIN NOW Drench'd in his gore, the destin'd sacrifice. END
BEGIN NOW Great Caesar sits sublime upon his throne, END
BEGIN NOW Before Apollo's porch of Parian stone; END
BEGIN NOW Accepts the presents vow'd for victory, END
BEGIN NOW And hangs the monumental crowns on high. END
BEGIN NOW Vast crowds of vanquish'd nations march along, END
BEGIN NOW Various in arms, in habit, and in tongue. END
BEGIN NOW Here, Mulciber assigns the proper place END
BEGIN NOW For Carians, and th' ungirt Numidian race; END
BEGIN NOW Then ranks the Thracians in the second row, END
BEGIN NOW With Scythians, expert in the dart and bow. END
BEGIN NOW And here the tam'd Euphrates humbly glides, END
BEGIN NOW And there the Rhine submits her swelling tides, END
BEGIN NOW And proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind; END
BEGIN NOW The Danes' unconquer'd offspring march behind, END
BEGIN NOW And Morini, the last of humankind. END
BEGIN NOW These figures, on the shield divinely wrought, END
BEGIN NOW By Vulcan labor'd, and by Venus brought, END
BEGIN NOW With joy and wonder fill the hero's thought. END
BEGIN NOW Unknown the names, he yet admires the grace, END
BEGIN NOW And bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race. END
BEGIN NOW While these affairs in distant places pass'd, END
BEGIN NOW The various Iris Juno sends with haste, END
BEGIN NOW To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought, END
BEGIN NOW The secret shade of his great grandsire sought. END
BEGIN NOW Retir'd alone she found the daring man, END
BEGIN NOW And op'd her rosy lips, and thus began: END
BEGIN NOW What none of all the gods could grant thy vows, END
BEGIN NOW That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows. END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas, gone to seek th' Arcadian prince, END
BEGIN NOW Has left the Trojan camp without defense; END
BEGIN NOW And, short of succors there, employs his pains END
BEGIN NOW In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains. END
BEGIN NOW Now snatch an hour that favors thy designs; END
BEGIN NOW Unite thy forces, and attack their lines. END
BEGIN NOW This said, on equal wings she pois'd her weight, END
BEGIN NOW And form'd a radiant rainbow in her flight. END
BEGIN NOW The Daunian hero lifts his hands eyes, END
BEGIN NOW And thus invokes the goddess as she flies: END
BEGIN NOW Iris, the grace of heav'n, what pow'r divine END
BEGIN NOW Has sent thee down, thro' dusky clouds to shine? END
BEGIN NOW See, they divide; immortal day appears, END
BEGIN NOW And glitt'ring planets dancing in their spheres! END
BEGIN NOW With joy, these happy omens I obey, END
BEGIN NOW And follow to the war the god that leads the way. END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, as by the brook he stood, END
BEGIN NOW He scoop'd the water from the crystal flood; END
BEGIN NOW Then with his hands the drops to heav'n he throws, END
BEGIN NOW And loads the pow'rs above with offer'd vows. END
BEGIN NOW Now march the bold confed'rates thro' the plain, END
BEGIN NOW Well hors'd, well clad; a rich and shining train. END
BEGIN NOW Messapus leads the van; and, in the rear, END
BEGIN NOW The sons of Tyrrheus in bright arms appear. END
BEGIN NOW In the main battle, with his flaming crest, END
BEGIN NOW The mighty Turnus tow'rs above the rest. END
BEGIN NOW Silent they move, majestically slow, END
BEGIN NOW Like ebbing Nile, or Ganges in his flow. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojans view the dusty cloud from far, END
BEGIN NOW And the dark menace of the distant war. END
BEGIN NOW Caicus from the rampire saw it rise, END
BEGIN NOW Black'ning the fields, and thick'ning thro' the skies. END
BEGIN NOW Then to his fellows thus aloud he calls: END
BEGIN NOW What rolling clouds, my friends, approach the walls? END
BEGIN NOW Arm! arm! and man the works! prepare your spears END
BEGIN NOW And pointed darts! the Latian host appears. END
BEGIN NOW Thus warn'd, they shut their gates; with shouts ascend END
BEGIN NOW The bulwarks, and, secure, their foes attend: END
BEGIN NOW For their wise gen'ral, with foreseeing care, END
BEGIN NOW Had charg'd them not to tempt the doubtful war, END
BEGIN NOW Nor, tho' provok'd, in open fields advance, END
BEGIN NOW But close within their lines attend their chance. END
BEGIN NOW Unwilling, yet they keep the strict command, END
BEGIN NOW And sourly wait in arms the hostile band. END
BEGIN NOW The fiery Turnus flew before the rest: END
BEGIN NOW A piebald steed of Thracian strain he press'd; END
BEGIN NOW His helm of massy gold, and crimson was his crest. END
BEGIN NOW With twenty horse to second his designs, END
BEGIN NOW An unexpected foe, he fac'd the lines. END
BEGIN NOW Is there," he said, "in arms, who bravely dare END
BEGIN NOW His leader's honor and his danger share? END
BEGIN NOW Then spurring on, his brandish'd dart he threw, END
BEGIN NOW In sign of war: applauding shouts ensue. END
BEGIN NOW Behind the rampires and the battle shun, END
BEGIN NOW He rides around the camp, with rolling eyes, END
BEGIN NOW And stops at ev'ry post, and ev'ry passage tries. END
BEGIN NOW So roams the nightly wolf about the fold: END
BEGIN NOW Wet with descending show'rs, and stiff with cold, END
BEGIN NOW He howls for hunger, and he grins for pain, END
BEGIN NOW (His gnashing teeth are exercis'd in vain,) END
BEGIN NOW And, impotent of anger, finds no way END
BEGIN NOW In his distended paws to grasp the prey. END
BEGIN NOW The mothers listen; but the bleating lambs END
BEGIN NOW Securely swig the dug, beneath the dams. END
BEGIN NOW Thus ranges eager Turnus o'er the plain. END
BEGIN NOW Sharp with desire, and furious with disdain; END
BEGIN NOW Surveys each passage with a piercing sight, END
BEGIN NOW To force his foes in equal field to fight. END
BEGIN NOW Thus while he gazes round, at length he spies, END
BEGIN NOW Where, fenc'd with strong redoubts, their navy lies, END
BEGIN NOW Close underneath the walls; the washing tide END
BEGIN NOW Secures from all approach this weaker side. END
BEGIN NOW He takes the wish'd occasion, fills his hand END
BEGIN NOW With ready fires, and shakes a flaming brand. END
BEGIN NOW Urg'd by his presence, ev'ry soul is warm'd, END
BEGIN NOW And ev'ry hand with kindled firs is arm'd. END
BEGIN NOW From the fir'd pines the scatt'ring sparkles fly; END
BEGIN NOW Fat vapors, mix'd with flames, involve the sky. END
BEGIN NOW What pow'r, O Muses, could avert the flame END
BEGIN NOW Which threaten'd, in the fleet, the Trojan name? END
BEGIN NOW Tell: for the fact, thro' length of time obscure, END
BEGIN NOW Is hard to faith; yet shall the fame endure. END
BEGIN NOW 'T is said that, when the chief prepar'd his flight, END
BEGIN NOW And fell'd his timber from Mount Ida's height, END
BEGIN NOW The grandam goddess then approach'd her son, END
BEGIN NOW And with a mother's majesty begun: END
BEGIN NOW Grant me," she said, "the sole request I bring, END
BEGIN NOW Since conquer'd heav'n has own'd you for its king. END
BEGIN NOW On Ida's brows, for ages past, there stood, END
BEGIN NOW With firs and maples fill'd, a shady wood; END
BEGIN NOW And on the summit rose a sacred grove, END
BEGIN NOW Where I was worship'd with religious love. END
BEGIN NOW Those woods, that holy grove, my long delight, END
BEGIN NOW I gave the Trojan prince, to speed his flight. END
BEGIN NOW Now, fill'd with fear, on their behalf I come; END
BEGIN NOW Let neither winds o'erset, nor waves intomb END
BEGIN NOW The floating forests of the sacred pine; END
BEGIN NOW But let it be their safety to be mine. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus replied her awful son, who rolls END
BEGIN NOW The radiant stars, and heav'n and earth controls: END
BEGIN NOW How dare you, mother, endless date demand END
BEGIN NOW For vessels molded by a mortal hand? END
BEGIN NOW What then is fate? Shall bold Aeneas ride, END
BEGIN NOW Of safety certain, on th' uncertain tide? END
BEGIN NOW Yet, what I can, I grant; when, wafted o'er, END
BEGIN NOW The chief is landed on the Latian shore, END
BEGIN NOW Whatever ships escape the raging storms, END
BEGIN NOW At my command shall change their fading forms END
BEGIN NOW To nymphs divine, and plow the wat'ry way, END
BEGIN NOW Like Dotis and the daughters of the sea. END
BEGIN NOW To seal his sacred vow, by Styx he swore, END
BEGIN NOW The lake of liquid pitch, the dreary shore, END
BEGIN NOW And Phlegethon's innavigable flood, END
BEGIN NOW And the black regions of his brother god. END
BEGIN NOW He said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod. END
BEGIN NOW And now at length the number'd hours were come, END
BEGIN NOW Prefix'd by fate's irrevocable doom, END
BEGIN NOW When the great Mother of the Gods was free END
BEGIN NOW To save her ships, and finish Jove's decree. END
BEGIN NOW First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung END
BEGIN NOW A light that sign'd the heav'ns, and shot along; END
BEGIN NOW Then from a cloud, fring'd round with golden fires, END
BEGIN NOW Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs; END
BEGIN NOW And, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds, END
BEGIN NOW Both hosts, in arms oppos'd, with equal horror wounds: END
BEGIN NOW O Trojan race, your needless aid forbear, END
BEGIN NOW And know, my ships are my peculiar care. END
BEGIN NOW With greater ease the bold Rutulian may, END
BEGIN NOW With hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea, END
BEGIN NOW Than singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge, END
BEGIN NOW Loos'd from your crooked anchors, launch at large, END
BEGIN NOW Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand, END
BEGIN NOW And swim the seas, at Cybele's command. END
BEGIN NOW No sooner had the goddess ceas'd to speak, END
BEGIN NOW When, lo! th' obedient ships their haulsers break; END
BEGIN NOW And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main END
BEGIN NOW They plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again: END
BEGIN NOW As many beauteous maids the billows sweep, END
BEGIN NOW As rode before tall vessels on the deep. END
BEGIN NOW The foes, surpris'd with wonder, stood aghast; END
BEGIN NOW Messapus curb'd his fiery courser's haste; END
BEGIN NOW Old Tiber roar'd, and, raising up his head, END
BEGIN NOW Call'd back his waters to their oozy bed. END
BEGIN NOW Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock, END
BEGIN NOW And with these words his trembling troops bespoke: END
BEGIN NOW These monsters for the Trojans' fate are meant, END
BEGIN NOW And are by Jove for black presages sent. END
BEGIN NOW He takes the cowards' last relief away; END
BEGIN NOW For fly they cannot, and, constrain'd to stay, END
BEGIN NOW Must yield unfought, a base inglorious prey. END
BEGIN NOW The liquid half of all the globe is lost; END
BEGIN NOW Heav'n shuts the seas, and we secure the coast. END
BEGIN NOW Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground END
BEGIN NOW Which myriads of our martial men surround. END
BEGIN NOW Their fates I fear not, or vain oracles. END
BEGIN NOW 'T was giv'n to Venus they should cross the seas, END
BEGIN NOW And land secure upon the Latian plains: END
BEGIN NOW Their promis'd hour is pass'd, and mine remains. END
BEGIN NOW 'T is in the fate of Turnus to destroy, END
BEGIN NOW With sword and fire, the faithless race of Troy. END
BEGIN NOW Shall such affronts as these alone inflame END
BEGIN NOW The Grecian brothers, and the Grecian name? END
BEGIN NOW My cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife, END
BEGIN NOW And final ruin, for a ravish'd wife. END
BEGIN NOW Was 't not enough, that, punish'd for the crime, END
BEGIN NOW They fell; but will they fall a second time? END
BEGIN NOW One would have thought they paid enough before, END
BEGIN NOW To curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more. END
BEGIN NOW Can they securely trust their feeble wall, END
BEGIN NOW A slight partition, a thin interval, END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt their fate and them; when Troy, tho' built END
BEGIN NOW By hands divine, yet perish'd by their guilt? END
BEGIN NOW Lend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands, END
BEGIN NOW Less than a thousand ships will end this war, END
BEGIN NOW Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare. END
BEGIN NOW Let all the Tuscans, all th' Arcadians, join! END
BEGIN NOW Nor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design. END
BEGIN NOW Let them not fear the treasons of the night, END
BEGIN NOW The robb'd Palladium, the pretended flight: END
BEGIN NOW Our onset shall be made in open light. END
BEGIN NOW No wooden engine shall their town betray; END
BEGIN NOW Fires they shall have around, but fires by day. END
BEGIN NOW No Grecian babes before their camp appear, END
BEGIN NOW Now, since the sun is rolling to the west, END
BEGIN NOW Give we the silent night to needful rest: END
BEGIN NOW Refresh your bodies, and your arms prepare; END
BEGIN NOW The morn shall end the small remains of war. END
BEGIN NOW The post of honor to Messapus falls, END
BEGIN NOW To keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls, END
BEGIN NOW To pitch the fires at distances around, END
BEGIN NOW And close the Trojans in their scanty ground. END
BEGIN NOW Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand, END
BEGIN NOW And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command; END
BEGIN NOW All clad in shining arms the works invest, END
BEGIN NOW Each with a radiant helm and waving crest. END
BEGIN NOW Stretch'd at their length, they press the grassy ground; END
BEGIN NOW They laugh, they sing, (the jolly bowls go round,) END
BEGIN NOW With lights and cheerful fires renew the day, END
BEGIN NOW And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojans, from above, their foes beheld, END
BEGIN NOW And with arm'd legions all the rampires fill'd. END
BEGIN NOW Seiz'd with affright, their gates they first explore; END
BEGIN NOW Join works to works with bridges, tow'r to tow'r: END
BEGIN NOW Thus all things needful for defense abound. END
BEGIN NOW Mnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round, END
BEGIN NOW Commission'd by their absent prince to share END
BEGIN NOW The common danger, and divide the care. END
BEGIN NOW The soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall, END
BEGIN NOW By turns relieve each other on the wall. END
BEGIN NOW Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance, END
BEGIN NOW To watch the gate was warlike Nisus' chance. END
BEGIN NOW His father Hyrtacus of noble blood; END
BEGIN NOW His mother was a huntress of the wood, END
BEGIN NOW And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear END
BEGIN NOW His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear, END
BEGIN NOW But better skill'd unerring shafts to send. END
BEGIN NOW Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend: END
BEGIN NOW Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host END
BEGIN NOW No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast- END
BEGIN NOW Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun. END
BEGIN NOW One was their care, and their delight was one: END
BEGIN NOW One common hazard in the war they shar'd, END
BEGIN NOW And now were both by choice upon the guard. END
BEGIN NOW Then Nisus thus: "Or do the gods inspire END
BEGIN NOW This warmth, or make we gods of our desire? END
BEGIN NOW A gen'rous ardor boils within my breast, END
BEGIN NOW Eager of action, enemy to rest: END
BEGIN NOW This urges me to fight, and fires my mind END
BEGIN NOW To leave a memorable name behind. END
BEGIN NOW Thou see'st the foe secure; how faintly shine END
BEGIN NOW Their scatter'd fires! the most, in sleep supine END
BEGIN NOW Along the ground, an easy conquest lie: END
BEGIN NOW The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply; END
BEGIN NOW All hush'd around. Now hear what I revolve- END
BEGIN NOW A thought unripe- and scarcely yet resolve. END
BEGIN NOW Our absent prince both camp and council mourn; END
BEGIN NOW By message both would hasten his return: END
BEGIN NOW If they confer what I demand on thee, END
BEGIN NOW (For fame is recompense enough for me,) END
BEGIN NOW Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied END
BEGIN NOW A way that safely will my passage guide. END
BEGIN NOW Euryalus stood list'ning while he spoke, END
BEGIN NOW With love of praise and noble envy struck; END
BEGIN NOW Then to his ardent friend expos'd his mind: END
BEGIN NOW All this, alone, and leaving me behind! END
BEGIN NOW Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be join'd? END
BEGIN NOW Thinkist thou I can my share of glory yield, END
BEGIN NOW Or send thee unassisted to the field? END
BEGIN NOW Not so my father taught my childhood arms; END
BEGIN NOW Born in a siege, and bred among alarms! END
BEGIN NOW Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend, END
BEGIN NOW Nor of the heav'n-born hero I attend. END
BEGIN NOW The thing call'd life, with ease I can disclaim, END
BEGIN NOW And think it over-sold to purchase fame. END
BEGIN NOW Then Nisus thus: "Alas! thy tender years END
BEGIN NOW Would minister new matter to my fears. END
BEGIN NOW So may the gods, who view this friendly strife, END
BEGIN NOW Restore me to thy lov'd embrace with life, END
BEGIN NOW Condemn'd to pay my vows, (as sure I trust,) END
BEGIN NOW This thy request is cruel and unjust. END
BEGIN NOW But if some chance- as many chances are, END
BEGIN NOW And doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war- END
BEGIN NOW If one should reach my head, there let it fall, END
BEGIN NOW And spare thy life; I would not perish all. END
BEGIN NOW Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date: END
BEGIN NOW Live thou to mourn thy love's unhappy fate; END
BEGIN NOW To bear my mangled body from the foe, END
BEGIN NOW Or buy it back, and fun'ral rites bestow. END
BEGIN NOW Or, if hard fortune shall those dues deny, END
BEGIN NOW Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply. END
BEGIN NOW O let not me the widow's tears renew! END
BEGIN NOW Nor let a mother's curse my name pursue: END
BEGIN NOW Thy pious parent, who, for love of thee, END
BEGIN NOW Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily, END
BEGIN NOW Her age committing to the seas and wind, END
BEGIN NOW When ev'ry weary matron stay'd behind. END
BEGIN NOW To this, Euryalus: "You plead in vain, END
BEGIN NOW And but protract the cause you cannot gain. END
BEGIN NOW No more delays, but haste!" With that, he wakes END
BEGIN NOW The nodding watch; each to his office takes. END
BEGIN NOW The guard reliev'd, the gen'rous couple went END
BEGIN NOW To find the council at the royal tent. END
BEGIN NOW All creatures else forgot their daily care, END
BEGIN NOW And sleep, the common gift of nature, share; END
BEGIN NOW Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate END
BEGIN NOW In nightly council for th' indanger'd state. END
BEGIN NOW They vote a message to their absent chief, END
BEGIN NOW Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief. END
BEGIN NOW Amid the camp a silent seat they chose, END
BEGIN NOW Remote from clamor, and secure from foes. END
BEGIN NOW On their left arms their ample shields they bear, END
BEGIN NOW The right reclin'd upon the bending spear. END
BEGIN NOW Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard, END
BEGIN NOW And beg admission, eager to be heard: END
BEGIN NOW Th' affair important, not to be deferr'd. END
BEGIN NOW Ascanius bids 'em be conducted in, END
BEGIN NOW Ord'ring the more experienc'd to begin. END
BEGIN NOW Then Nisus thus: "Ye fathers, lend your ears; END
BEGIN NOW Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years. END
BEGIN NOW The foe, securely drench'd in sleep and wine, END
BEGIN NOW Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine; END
BEGIN NOW And where the smoke in cloudy vapors flies, END
BEGIN NOW Cov'ring the plain, and curling to the skies, END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide, END
BEGIN NOW Close by the sea, a passage we have spied, END
BEGIN NOW Which will our way to great Aeneas guide. END
BEGIN NOW Expect each hour to see him safe again, END
BEGIN NOW Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain. END
BEGIN NOW Snatch we the lucky minute while we may; END
BEGIN NOW Nor can we be mistaken in the way; END
BEGIN NOW For, hunting in the vale, we both have seen END
BEGIN NOW The rising turrets, and the stream between, END
BEGIN NOW And know the winding course, with ev'ry ford. END
BEGIN NOW He ceas'd; and old Alethes took the word: END
BEGIN NOW Our country gods, in whom our trust we place, END
BEGIN NOW Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race, END
BEGIN NOW While we behold such dauntless worth appear END
BEGIN NOW In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear. END
BEGIN NOW Then into tears of joy the father broke; END
BEGIN NOW Each in his longing arms by turns he took; END
BEGIN NOW Panted and paus'd; and thus again he spoke: END
BEGIN NOW Ye brave young men, what equal gifts can we, END
BEGIN NOW In recompense of such desert, decree? END
BEGIN NOW The greatest, sure, and best you can receive, END
BEGIN NOW The gods and your own conscious worth will give. END
BEGIN NOW The rest our grateful gen'ral will bestow, END
BEGIN NOW And young Ascanius till his manhood owe. END
BEGIN NOW And I, whose welfare in my father lies, END
BEGIN NOW Ascanius adds, "by the great deities, END
BEGIN NOW By my dear country, by my household gods, END
BEGIN NOW By hoary Vesta's rites and dark abodes, END
BEGIN NOW Adjure you both, (on you my fortune stands; END
BEGIN NOW That and my faith I plight into your hands,) END
BEGIN NOW Make me but happy in his safe return, END
BEGIN NOW Whose wanted presence I can only mourn; END
BEGIN NOW Your common gift shall two large goblets be END
BEGIN NOW Of silver, wrought with curious imagery, END
BEGIN NOW And high emboss'd, which, when old Priam reign'd, END
BEGIN NOW My conqu'ring sire at sack'd Arisba gain'd; END
BEGIN NOW And more, two tripods cast in antic mold, END
BEGIN NOW With two great talents of the finest gold; END
BEGIN NOW Beside a costly bowl, ingrav'd with art, END
BEGIN NOW Which Dido gave, when first she gave her heart. END
BEGIN NOW But, if in conquer'd Italy we reign, END
BEGIN NOW When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain- END
BEGIN NOW Thou saw'st the courser by proud Turnus press'd: END
BEGIN NOW That, Nisus, and his arms, and nodding crest, END
BEGIN NOW And shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy share: END
BEGIN NOW Twelve lab'ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair END
BEGIN NOW All clad in rich attire, and train'd with care; END
BEGIN NOW And, last, a Latian field with fruitful plains, END
BEGIN NOW And a large portion of the king's domains. END
BEGIN NOW But thou, whose years are more to mine allied- END
BEGIN NOW No fate my vow'd affection shall divide END
BEGIN NOW From thee, heroic youth! Be wholly mine; END
BEGIN NOW Take full possession; all my soul is thine. END
BEGIN NOW One faith, one fame, one fate, shall both attend; END
BEGIN NOW My life's companion, and my bosom friend: END
BEGIN NOW My peace shall be committed to thy care, END
BEGIN NOW And to thy conduct my concerns in war. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus the young Euryalus replied: END
BEGIN NOW Whatever fortune, good or bad, betide, END
BEGIN NOW The same shall be my age, as now my youth; END
BEGIN NOW No time shall find me wanting to my truth. END
BEGIN NOW This only from your goodness let me gain END
BEGIN NOW (And, this ungranted, all rewards are vain) END
BEGIN NOW Of Priam's royal race my mother came- END
BEGIN NOW And sure the best that ever bore the name- END
BEGIN NOW Whom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold END
BEGIN NOW From me departing, but, o'erspent and old, END
BEGIN NOW My fate she follow'd. Ignorant of this END
BEGIN NOW (Whatever) danger, neither parting kiss, END
BEGIN NOW Nor pious blessing taken, her I leave, END
BEGIN NOW And in this only act of all my life deceive. END
BEGIN NOW By this right hand and conscious Night I swear, END
BEGIN NOW My soul so sad a farewell could not bear. END
BEGIN NOW Be you her comfort; fill my vacant place END
BEGIN NOW (Permit me to presume so great a grace) END
BEGIN NOW Support her age, forsaken and distress'd. END
BEGIN NOW That hope alone will fortify my breast END
BEGIN NOW Against the worst of fortunes, and of fears. END
BEGIN NOW He said. The mov'd assistants melt in tears. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus Ascanius, wonderstruck to see END
BEGIN NOW That image of his filial piety: END
BEGIN NOW So great beginnings, in so green an age, END
BEGIN NOW Exact the faith which I again ingage. END
BEGIN NOW Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim, END
BEGIN NOW Creusa had, and only want the name. END
BEGIN NOW Whate'er event thy bold attempt shall have, END
BEGIN NOW 'T is merit to have borne a son so brave. END
BEGIN NOW Now by my head, a sacred oath, I swear, END
BEGIN NOW (My father us'd it,) what, returning here END
BEGIN NOW Crown'd with success, I for thyself prepare, END
BEGIN NOW That, if thou fail, shall thy lov'd mother share. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and weeping, while he spoke the word, END
BEGIN NOW From his broad belt he drew a shining sword, END
BEGIN NOW Magnificent with gold. Lycaon made, END
BEGIN NOW And in an ivory scabbard sheath'd the blade. END
BEGIN NOW This was his gift. Great Mnestheus gave his friend END
BEGIN NOW A lion's hide, his body to defend; END
BEGIN NOW And good Alethes furnish'd him, beside, END
BEGIN NOW With his own trusty helm, of temper tried. END
BEGIN NOW Thus arm'd they went. The noble Trojans wait END
BEGIN NOW Their issuing forth, and follow to the gate END
BEGIN NOW With prayers and vows. Above the rest appears END
BEGIN NOW Ascanius, manly far beyond his years, END
BEGIN NOW And messages committed to their care, END
BEGIN NOW Which all in winds were lost, and flitting air. END
BEGIN NOW The trenches first they pass'd; then took their way END
BEGIN NOW Where their proud foes in pitch'd pavilions lay; END
BEGIN NOW To many fatal, ere themselves were slain. END
BEGIN NOW They found the careless host dispers'd upon the plain, END
BEGIN NOW Who, gorg'd, and drunk with wine, supinely snore. END
BEGIN NOW Unharness'd chariots stand along the shore: END
BEGIN NOW Amidst the wheels and reins, the goblet by, END
BEGIN NOW A medley of debauch and war, they lie. END
BEGIN NOW Observing Nisus shew'd his friend the sight: END
BEGIN NOW Behold a conquest gain'd without a fight. END
BEGIN NOW Occasion offers, and I stand prepar'd; END
BEGIN NOW There lies our way; be thou upon the guard, END
BEGIN NOW And look around, while I securely go, END
BEGIN NOW And hew a passage thro' the sleeping foe. END
BEGIN NOW Softly he spoke; then striding took his way, END
BEGIN NOW With his drawn sword, where haughty Rhamnes lay; END
BEGIN NOW His head rais'd high on tapestry beneath, END
BEGIN NOW And heaving from his breast, he drew his breath; END
BEGIN NOW A king and prophet, by King Turnus lov'd: END
BEGIN NOW But fate by prescience cannot be remov'd. END
BEGIN NOW Him and his sleeping slaves he slew; then spies END
BEGIN NOW Where Remus, with his rich retinue, lies. END
BEGIN NOW His armor-bearer first, and next he kills END
BEGIN NOW His charioteer, intrench'd betwixt the wheels END
BEGIN NOW And his lov'd horses; last invades their lord; END
BEGIN NOW Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword: END
BEGIN NOW The gasping head flies off; a purple flood END
BEGIN NOW Flows from the trunk, that welters in the blood, END
BEGIN NOW Which, by the spurning heels dispers'd around, END
BEGIN NOW The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Lamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong, END
BEGIN NOW He slew, and then Serranus fair and young. END
BEGIN NOW From dice and wine the youth retir'd to rest, END
BEGIN NOW And puff'd the fumy god from out his breast: END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play- END
BEGIN NOW More lucky, had it lasted till the day. END
BEGIN NOW The famish'd lion thus, with hunger bold, END
BEGIN NOW O'erleaps the fences of the nightly fold, END
BEGIN NOW And tears the peaceful flocks: with silent awe END
BEGIN NOW Trembling they lie, and pant beneath his paw. END
BEGIN NOW Nor with less rage Euryalus employs END
BEGIN NOW The wrathful sword, or fewer foes destroys; END
BEGIN NOW But on th' ignoble crowd his fury flew; END
BEGIN NOW He Fadus, Hebesus, and Rhoetus slew. END
BEGIN NOW Oppress'd with heavy sleep the former fell, END
BEGIN NOW But Rhoetus wakeful, and observing all: END
BEGIN NOW Behind a spacious jar he slink'd for fear; END
BEGIN NOW The fatal iron found and reach'd him there; END
BEGIN NOW For, as he rose, it pierc'd his naked side, END
BEGIN NOW And, reeking, thence return'd in crimson dyed. END
BEGIN NOW The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood; END
BEGIN NOW The purple soul comes floating in the flood. END
BEGIN NOW Now, where Messapus quarter'd, they arrive. END
BEGIN NOW The fires were fainting there, and just alive; END
BEGIN NOW The warrior-horses, tied in order, fed. END
BEGIN NOW Nisus observ'd the discipline, and said: END
BEGIN NOW Our eager thirst of blood may both betray; END
BEGIN NOW And see the scatter'd streaks of dawning day, END
BEGIN NOW Foe to nocturnal thefts. No more, my friend; END
BEGIN NOW Here let our glutted execution end. END
BEGIN NOW A lane thro' slaughter'd bodies we have made. END
BEGIN NOW The bold Euryalus, tho' loth, obey'd. END
BEGIN NOW Of arms, and arras, and of plate, they find END
BEGIN NOW A precious load; but these they leave behind. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, fond of gaudy spoils, the boy would stay END
BEGIN NOW To make the rich caparison his prey, END
BEGIN NOW Which on the steed of conquer'd Rhamnes lay. END
BEGIN NOW Nor did his eyes less longingly behold END
BEGIN NOW The girdle-belt, with nails of burnish'd gold. END
BEGIN NOW This present Caedicus the rich bestow'd END
BEGIN NOW On Remulus, when friendship first they vow'd, END
BEGIN NOW And, absent, join'd in hospitable ties: END
BEGIN NOW He, dying, to his heir bequeath'd the prize; END
BEGIN NOW Till, by the conqu'ring Ardean troops oppress'd, END
BEGIN NOW He fell; and they the glorious gift possess'd. END
BEGIN NOW These glitt'ring spoils (now made the victor's gain) END
BEGIN NOW He to his body suits, but suits in vain: END
BEGIN NOW Messapus' helm he finds among the rest, END
BEGIN NOW And laces on, and wears the waving crest. END
BEGIN NOW Proud of their conquest, prouder of their prey, END
BEGIN NOW They leave the camp, and take the ready way. END
BEGIN NOW But far they had not pass'd, before they spied END
BEGIN NOW Three hundred horse, with Volscens for their guide. END
BEGIN NOW The queen a legion to King Turnus sent; END
BEGIN NOW But the swift horse the slower foot prevent, END
BEGIN NOW And now, advancing, sought the leader's tent. END
BEGIN NOW They saw the pair; for, thro' the doubtful shade, END
BEGIN NOW His shining helm Euryalus betray'd, END
BEGIN NOW On which the moon with full reflection play'd. END
BEGIN NOW 'T is not for naught," cried Volscens from the crowd, END
BEGIN NOW These men go there;" then rais'd his voice aloud: END
BEGIN NOW Stand! stand! why thus in arms? And whither bent? END
BEGIN NOW From whence, to whom, and on what errand sent? END
BEGIN NOW Silent they scud away, and haste their flight END
BEGIN NOW To neighb'ring woods, and trust themselves to night. END
BEGIN NOW The speedy horse all passages belay, END
BEGIN NOW And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way, END
BEGIN NOW And watch each entrance of the winding wood. END
BEGIN NOW Black was the forest: thick with beech it stood, END
BEGIN NOW Horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn; END
BEGIN NOW Few paths of human feet, or tracks of beasts, were worn. END
BEGIN NOW The darkness of the shades, his heavy prey, END
BEGIN NOW And fear, misled the younger from his way. END
BEGIN NOW But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste, END
BEGIN NOW And, thoughtless of his friend, the forest pass'd, END
BEGIN NOW And Alban plains, from Alba's name so call'd, END
BEGIN NOW Where King Latinus then his oxen stall'd; END
BEGIN NOW Till, turning at the length, he stood his ground, END
BEGIN NOW And miss'd his friend, and cast his eyes around: END
BEGIN NOW Ah wretch!" he cried, "where have I left behind END
BEGIN NOW Th' unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find? END
BEGIN NOW Or what way take?" Again he ventures back, END
BEGIN NOW And treads the mazes of his former track. END
BEGIN NOW He winds the wood, and, list'ning, hears the noise END
BEGIN NOW Of tramping coursers, and the riders' voice. END
BEGIN NOW The sound approach'd; and suddenly he view'd END
BEGIN NOW The foes inclosing, and his friend pursued, END
BEGIN NOW Forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain END
BEGIN NOW The shelter of the friendly shades to gain. END
BEGIN NOW What should he next attempt? what arms employ, END
BEGIN NOW What fruitless force, to free the captive boy? END
BEGIN NOW Or desperate should he rush and lose his life, END
BEGIN NOW With odds oppress'd, in such unequal strife? END
BEGIN NOW Resolv'd at length, his pointed spear he shook; END
BEGIN NOW And, casting on the moon a mournful look: END
BEGIN NOW Guardian of groves, and goddess of the night, END
BEGIN NOW Fair queen," he said, "direct my dart aright. END
BEGIN NOW If e'er my pious father, for my sake, END
BEGIN NOW Did grateful off'rings on thy altars make, END
BEGIN NOW Or I increas'd them with my sylvan toils, END
BEGIN NOW And hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils, END
BEGIN NOW Give me to scatter these." Then from his ear END
BEGIN NOW He pois'd, and aim'd, and launch'd the trembling spear. END
BEGIN NOW The deadly weapon, hissing from the grove, END
BEGIN NOW Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove; END
BEGIN NOW Pierc'd his thin armor, drank his vital blood, END
BEGIN NOW And in his body left the broken END
BEGIN NOW He staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death, END
BEGIN NOW And with short sobs he gasps away his breath. END
BEGIN NOW All stand amaz'd- a second jav'lin flies END
BEGIN NOW With equal strength, and quivers thro' the skies. END
BEGIN NOW This thro' thy temples, Tagus, forc'd the way, END
BEGIN NOW And in the brainpan warmly buried lay. END
BEGIN NOW Fierce Volscens foams with rage, and, gazing round, END
BEGIN NOW Descried not him who gave the fatal wound, END
BEGIN NOW Nor knew to fix revenge: "But thou," he cries, END
BEGIN NOW Shalt pay for both," and at the pris'ner flies END
BEGIN NOW With his drawn sword. Then, struck with deep despair, END
BEGIN NOW That cruel sight the lover could not bear; END
BEGIN NOW But from his covert rush'd in open view, END
BEGIN NOW And sent his voice before him as he flew: END
BEGIN NOW Me! me!" he cried- "turn all your swords alone END
BEGIN NOW On me- the fact confess'd, the fault my own. END
BEGIN NOW He neither could nor durst, the guiltless youth: END
BEGIN NOW Ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth! END
BEGIN NOW His only crime (if friendship can offend) END
BEGIN NOW Is too much love to his unhappy friend. END
BEGIN NOW Too late he speaks: the sword, which fury guides, END
BEGIN NOW Driv'n with full force, had pierc'd his tender sides. END
BEGIN NOW Down fell the beauteous youth: the yawning wound END
BEGIN NOW Gush'd out a purple stream, and stain'd the ground. END
BEGIN NOW His snowy neck reclines upon his breast, END
BEGIN NOW Like a fair flow'r by the keen share oppress'd; END
BEGIN NOW Like a white poppy sinking on the plain, END
BEGIN NOW Whose heavy head is overcharg'd with rain. END
BEGIN NOW Despair, and rage, and vengeance justly vow'd, END
BEGIN NOW Drove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd. END
BEGIN NOW Volscens he seeks; on him alone he bends: END
BEGIN NOW Borne back and bor'd by his surrounding friends, END
BEGIN NOW Onward he press'd, and kept him still in sight; END
BEGIN NOW Then whirl'd aloft his sword with all his might: END
BEGIN NOW Th' unerring steel descended while he spoke, END
BEGIN NOW Piered his wide mouth, and thro' his weazon broke. END
BEGIN NOW Dying, he slew; and, stagg'ring on the plain, END
BEGIN NOW With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain; END
BEGIN NOW Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell, END
BEGIN NOW Content, in death, to be reveng'd so well. END
BEGIN NOW O happy friends! for, if my verse can give END
BEGIN NOW Immortal life, your fame shall ever live, END
BEGIN NOW Fix'd as the Capitol's foundation lies, END
BEGIN NOW And spread, where'er the Roman eagle flies! END
BEGIN NOW The conqu'ring party first divide the prey, END
BEGIN NOW Then their slain leader to the camp convey. END
BEGIN NOW With wonder, as they went, the troops were fill'd, END
BEGIN NOW To see such numbers whom so few had kill'd. END
BEGIN NOW Serranus, Rhamnes, and the rest, they found: END
BEGIN NOW Vast crowds the dying and the dead surround; END
BEGIN NOW And the yet reeking blood o'erflows the ground. END
BEGIN NOW All knew the helmet which Messapus lost, END
BEGIN NOW But mourn'd a purchase that so dear had cost. END
BEGIN NOW Now rose the ruddy morn from Tithon's bed, END
BEGIN NOW And with the dawn of day the skies o'erspread; END
BEGIN NOW Nor long the sun his daily course withheld, END
BEGIN NOW But added colors to the world reveal'd: END
BEGIN NOW When early Turnus, wak'ning with the light, END
BEGIN NOW All clad in armor, calls his troops to fight. END
BEGIN NOW His martial men with fierce harangue he fir'd, END
BEGIN NOW And his own ardor in their souls inspir'd. END
BEGIN NOW This done- to give new terror to his foes, END
BEGIN NOW The heads of Nisus and his friend he shows, END
BEGIN NOW Rais'd high on pointed spears- a ghastly sight: END
BEGIN NOW Loud peals of shouts ensue, and barbarous delight. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime the Trojans run, where danger calls; END
BEGIN NOW They line their trenches, and they man their walls. END
BEGIN NOW In front extended to the left they stood; END
BEGIN NOW Safe was the right, surrounded by the flood. END
BEGIN NOW But, casting from their tow'rs a frightful view, END
BEGIN NOW They saw the faces, which too well they knew, END
BEGIN NOW Tho' then disguis'd in death, and smear'd all o'er END
BEGIN NOW With filth obscene, and dropping putrid gore. END
BEGIN NOW Soon hasty fame thro' the sad city bears END
BEGIN NOW The mournful message to the mother's ears. END
BEGIN NOW An icy cold benumbs her limbs; she shakes; END
BEGIN NOW Her cheeks the blood, her hand the web forsakes. END
BEGIN NOW She runs the rampires round amidst the war, END
BEGIN NOW Nor fears the flying darts; she rends her hair, END
BEGIN NOW And fills with loud laments the liquid air. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, then, my lov'd Euryalus appears! END
BEGIN NOW Thus looks the prop my declining years! END
BEGIN NOW Was't on this face my famish'd eyes I fed? END
BEGIN NOW Ah! how unlike the living is the dead! END
BEGIN NOW And could'st thou leave me, cruel, thus alone? END
BEGIN NOW Not one kind kiss from a departing son! END
BEGIN NOW No look, no last adieu before he went, END
BEGIN NOW In an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent! END
BEGIN NOW Cold on the ground, and pressing foreign clay, END
BEGIN NOW To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey! END
BEGIN NOW Nor was I near to close his dying eyes, END
BEGIN NOW To wash his wounds, to weep his obsequies, END
BEGIN NOW To call about his corpse his crying friends, END
BEGIN NOW Or spread the mantle (made for other ends) END
BEGIN NOW On his dear body, which I wove with care, END
BEGIN NOW Nor did my daily pains or nightly labor spare. END
BEGIN NOW Where shall I find his corpse? what earth sustains END
BEGIN NOW His trunk dismember'd, and his cold remains? END
BEGIN NOW For this, alas! I left my needful ease, END
BEGIN NOW Expos'd my life to winds and winter seas! END
BEGIN NOW If any pity touch Rutulian hearts, END
BEGIN NOW Here empty all your quivers, all your darts; END
BEGIN NOW Or, if they fail, thou, Jove, conclude my woe, END
BEGIN NOW And send me thunderstruck to shades below! END
BEGIN NOW Her shrieks and clamors pierce the Trojans' ears, END
BEGIN NOW Unman their courage, and augment their fears; END
BEGIN NOW Nor young Ascanius could the sight sustain, END
BEGIN NOW Nor old Ilioneus his tears restrain, END
BEGIN NOW But Actor and Idaeus jointly sent, END
BEGIN NOW To bear the madding mother to her tent. END
BEGIN NOW And now the trumpets terribly, from far, END
BEGIN NOW With rattling clangor, rouse the sleepy war. END
BEGIN NOW The soldiers' shouts succeed the brazen sounds; END
BEGIN NOW And heav'n, from pole to pole, the noise rebounds. END
BEGIN NOW The Volscians bear their shields upon their head, END
BEGIN NOW And, rushing forward, form a moving shed. END
BEGIN NOW These fill the ditch; those pull the bulwarks down: END
BEGIN NOW Some raise the ladders; others scale the town. END
BEGIN NOW But, where void spaces on the walls appear, END
BEGIN NOW Or thin defense, they pour their forces there. END
BEGIN NOW With poles and missive weapons, from afar, END
BEGIN NOW The Trojans keep aloof the rising war. END
BEGIN NOW Taught, by their ten years' siege, defensive fight, END
BEGIN NOW They roll down ribs of rocks, an unresisted weight, END
BEGIN NOW To break the penthouse with the pond'rous blow, END
BEGIN NOW Which yet the patient Volscians undergo: END
BEGIN NOW But could not bear th' unequal combat long; END
BEGIN NOW For, where the Trojans find the thickest throng, END
BEGIN NOW The ruin falls: their shatter'd shields give way, END
BEGIN NOW And their crush'd heads become an easy prey. END
BEGIN NOW They shrink for fear, abated of their rage, END
BEGIN NOW Nor longer dare in a blind fight engage; END
BEGIN NOW Contented now to gall them from below END
BEGIN NOW With darts and slings, and with the distant bow. END
BEGIN NOW Elsewhere Mezentius, terrible to view, END
BEGIN NOW A blazing pine within the trenches threw. END
BEGIN NOW But brave Messapus, Neptune's warlike son, END
BEGIN NOW Broke down the palisades, the trenches won, END
BEGIN NOW And loud for ladders calls, to scale the town. END
BEGIN NOW Calliope, begin! Ye sacred Nine, END
BEGIN NOW Inspire your poet in his high design, END
BEGIN NOW To sing what slaughter manly Turnus made, END
BEGIN NOW What souls he sent below the Stygian shade, END
BEGIN NOW What fame the soldiers with their captain share, END
BEGIN NOW And the vast circuit of the fatal war; END
BEGIN NOW For you in singing martial facts excel; END
BEGIN NOW You best remember, and alone can tell. END
BEGIN NOW There stood a tow'r, amazing to the sight, END
BEGIN NOW Built up of beams, and of stupendous height: END
BEGIN NOW Art, and the nature of the place, conspir'd END
BEGIN NOW To furnish all the strength that war requir'd. END
BEGIN NOW To level this, the bold Italians join; END
BEGIN NOW The wary Trojans obviate their design; END
BEGIN NOW With weighty stones o'erwhelm their troops below, END
BEGIN NOW Shoot thro' the loopholes, and sharp jav'lins throw. END
BEGIN NOW Turnus, the chief, toss'd from his thund'ring hand END
BEGIN NOW Against the wooden walls, a flaming brand: END
BEGIN NOW It stuck, the fiery plague; the winds were high; END
BEGIN NOW The planks were season'd, and the timber dry. END
BEGIN NOW Contagion caught the posts; it spread along, END
BEGIN NOW Scorch'd, and to distance drove the scatter'd throng. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojans fled; the fire pursued amain, END
BEGIN NOW Still gath'ring fast upon the trembling train; END
BEGIN NOW Till, crowding to the corners of the wall, END
BEGIN NOW Down the defense and the defenders fall. END
BEGIN NOW The mighty flaw makes heav'n itself resound: END
BEGIN NOW The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground. END
BEGIN NOW The tow'r, that follow'd on the fallen crew, END
BEGIN NOW Whelm'd o'er their heads, and buried whom it slew: END
BEGIN NOW Some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent; END
BEGIN NOW All the same equal ruin underwent. END
BEGIN NOW Young Lycus and Helenor only scape; END
BEGIN NOW Sav'd- how, they know not- from the steepy leap. END
BEGIN NOW Helenor, elder of the two: by birth, END
BEGIN NOW On one side royal, one a son of earth, END
BEGIN NOW Whom to the Lydian king Licymnia bare, END
BEGIN NOW (A privilege which none but freemen share). END
BEGIN NOW Slight were his arms, a sword and silver shield: END
BEGIN NOW No marks of honor charg'd its empty field. END
BEGIN NOW Light as he fell, so light the youth arose, END
BEGIN NOW And rising, found himself amidst his foes; END
BEGIN NOW Nor flight was left, nor hopes to force his way. END
BEGIN NOW Embolden'd by despair, he stood at bay; END
BEGIN NOW And- like a stag, whom all the troop surrounds END
BEGIN NOW Of eager huntsmen and invading hounds- END
BEGIN NOW Resolv'd on death, he dissipates his fears, END
BEGIN NOW And bounds aloft against the pointed spears: END
BEGIN NOW So dares the youth, secure of death; and throws END
BEGIN NOW His dying body on his thickest foes. END
BEGIN NOW But Lycus, swifter of his feet by far, END
BEGIN NOW Runs, doubles, winds and turns, amidst the war; END
BEGIN NOW Springs to the walls, and leaves his foes behind, END
BEGIN NOW And snatches at the beam he first can find; END
BEGIN NOW Looks up, and leaps aloft at all the stretch, END
BEGIN NOW In hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to reach. END
BEGIN NOW But Turnus follow'd hard his hunted prey END
BEGIN NOW (His spear had almost reach'd him in the way, END
BEGIN NOW Short of his reins, and scarce a span behind) END
BEGIN NOW Fool! said the chief, "tho' fleeter than the wind, END
BEGIN NOW Couldst thou presume to scape, when I pursue? END
BEGIN NOW He said, and downward by the feet he drew END
BEGIN NOW Vast ruins come along, rent from the smoking walls. END
BEGIN NOW Thus on some silver swan, or tim'rous hare, END
BEGIN NOW Jove's bird comes sousing down from upper air; END
BEGIN NOW Her crooked talons truss the fearful prey: END
BEGIN NOW Then out of sight she soars, and wings her way. END
BEGIN NOW So seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb, END
BEGIN NOW In vain lamented by the bleating dam. END
BEGIN NOW Then rushing onward with a barb'rous cry, END
BEGIN NOW The troops of Turnus to the combat fly. END
BEGIN NOW Toss'd firebrands to the steepy turrets throw. END
BEGIN NOW Ilioneus, as bold Lucetius came END
BEGIN NOW To force the gate, and feed the kindling flame, END
BEGIN NOW Roll'd down the fragment of a rock so right, END
BEGIN NOW It crush'd him double underneath the weight. END
BEGIN NOW Two more young Liger and Asylas slew: END
BEGIN NOW To bend the bow young Liger better knew; END
BEGIN NOW Asylas best the pointed jav'lin threw. END
BEGIN NOW Brave Caeneus laid Ortygius on the plain; END
BEGIN NOW The victor Caeneus was by Turnus slain. END
BEGIN NOW By the same hand, Clonius and Itys fall, END
BEGIN NOW Sagar, and Ida, standing on the wall. END
BEGIN NOW From Capys' arms his fate Privernus found: END
BEGIN NOW Hurt by Themilla first-but slight the wound- END
BEGIN NOW His shield thrown by, to mitigate the smart, END
BEGIN NOW He clapp'd his hand upon the wounded part: END
BEGIN NOW The second shaft came swift and unespied, END
BEGIN NOW And pierc'd his hand, and nail'd it to his side, END
BEGIN NOW Transfix'd his breathing lungs and beating heart: END
BEGIN NOW The soul came issuing out, and hiss'd against the dart. END
BEGIN NOW The son of Arcens shone amid the rest, END
BEGIN NOW In glitt'ring armor and a purple vest, END
BEGIN NOW (Fair was his face, his eyes inspiring love,) END
BEGIN NOW Bred by his father in the Martian grove, END
BEGIN NOW Where the fat altars of Palicus flame, END
BEGIN NOW And send in arms to purchase early fame. END
BEGIN NOW Him when he spied from far, the Tuscan king END
BEGIN NOW Laid by the lance, and took him to the sling, END
BEGIN NOW Thrice whirl'd the thong around his head, and threw: END
BEGIN NOW The heated lead half melted as it flew; END
BEGIN NOW It pierc'd his hollow temples and his brain; END
BEGIN NOW The youth came tumbling down, and spurn'd the plain. END
BEGIN NOW Then young Ascanius, who, before this day, END
BEGIN NOW Was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey, END
BEGIN NOW First bent in martial strife the twanging bow, END
BEGIN NOW And exercis'd against a human foe- END
BEGIN NOW With this bereft Numanus of his life, END
BEGIN NOW Who Turnus' younger sister took to wife. END
BEGIN NOW Proud of his realm, and of his royal bride, END
BEGIN NOW Vaunting before his troops, and lengthen'd with a stride, END
BEGIN NOW In these insulting terms the Trojans he defied: END
BEGIN NOW Twice-conquer'd cowards, now your shame is shown- END
BEGIN NOW Coop'd up a second time within your town! END
BEGIN NOW Who dare not issue forth in open field, END
BEGIN NOW But hold your walls before you for a shield. END
BEGIN NOW Thus threat you war? thus our alliance force? END
BEGIN NOW What gods, what madness, hether steer'd your course? END
BEGIN NOW You shall not find the sons of Atreus here, END
BEGIN NOW Nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear. END
BEGIN NOW Strong from the cradle, of a sturdy brood, END
BEGIN NOW We bear our newborn infants to the flood; END
BEGIN NOW There bath'd amid the stream, our boys we hold, END
BEGIN NOW With winter harden'd, and inur'd to cold. END
BEGIN NOW They wake before the day to range the wood, END
BEGIN NOW Kill ere they eat, nor taste unconquer'd food. END
BEGIN NOW No sports, but what belong to war, they know: END
BEGIN NOW To break the stubborn colt, to bend the bow. END
BEGIN NOW Our youth, of labor patient, earn their bread; END
BEGIN NOW Hardly they work, with frugal diet fed. END
BEGIN NOW From plows and harrows sent to seek renown, END
BEGIN NOW They fight in fields, and storm the shaken town. END
BEGIN NOW No part of life from toils of war is free, END
BEGIN NOW No change in age, or diff'rence in degree. END
BEGIN NOW We plow and till in arms; our oxen feel, END
BEGIN NOW Instead of goads, the spur and pointed steel; END
BEGIN NOW Th' inverted lance makes furrows in the plain. END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n time, that changes all, yet changes us in vain: END
BEGIN NOW The body, not the mind; nor can control END
BEGIN NOW Th' immortal vigor, or abate the soul. END
BEGIN NOW Our helms defend the young, disguise the gray: END
BEGIN NOW We live by plunder, and delight in prey. END
BEGIN NOW Your vests embroider'd with rich purple shine; END
BEGIN NOW In sloth you glory, and in dances join. END
BEGIN NOW Your vests have sweeping sleeves; with female pride END
BEGIN NOW Your turbants underneath your chins are tied. END
BEGIN NOW Go, Phrygians, to your Dindymus again! END
BEGIN NOW Go, less than women, in the shapes of men! END
BEGIN NOW Go, mix'd with eunuchs, in the Mother's rites, END
BEGIN NOW Where with unequal sound the flute invites; END
BEGIN NOW Sing, dance, and howl, by turns, in Ida's shade: END
BEGIN NOW Resign the war to men, who know the martial trade! END
BEGIN NOW This foul reproach Ascanius could not hear END
BEGIN NOW With patience, or a vow'd revenge forbear. END
BEGIN NOW At the full stretch of both his hands he drew, END
BEGIN NOW And almost join'd the horns of the tough yew. END
BEGIN NOW But, first, before the throne of Jove he stood, END
BEGIN NOW And thus with lifted hands invok'd the god: END
BEGIN NOW My first attempt, great Jupiter, succeed! END
BEGIN NOW An annual off'ring in thy grove shall bleed; END
BEGIN NOW A snow-white steer, before thy altar led, END
BEGIN NOW Who, like his mother, bears aloft his head, END
BEGIN NOW Butts with his threat'ning brows, and bellowing stands, END
BEGIN NOW And dares the fight, and spurns the yellow sands. END
BEGIN NOW Jove bow'd the heav'ns, and lent a gracious ear, END
BEGIN NOW And thunder'd on the left, amidst the clear. END
BEGIN NOW Sounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies END
BEGIN NOW The feather'd death, and hisses thro' the skies. END
BEGIN NOW The steel thro' both his temples forc'd the way: END
BEGIN NOW Extended on the ground, Numanus lay. END
BEGIN NOW Go now, vain boaster, and true valor scorn! END
BEGIN NOW The Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return. END
BEGIN NOW Ascanius said no more. The Trojans shake END
BEGIN NOW The heav'ns with shouting, and new vigor take. END
BEGIN NOW Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud, END
BEGIN NOW To view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd; END
BEGIN NOW And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud: END
BEGIN NOW Advance, illustrious youth, increase in fame, END
BEGIN NOW And wide from east to west extend thy name; END
BEGIN NOW Offspring of gods thyself; and Rome shall owe END
BEGIN NOW To thee a race of demigods below. END
BEGIN NOW This is the way to heav'n: the pow'rs divine END
BEGIN NOW From this beginning date the Julian line. END
BEGIN NOW To thee, to them, and their victorious heirs, END
BEGIN NOW The conquer'd war is due, and the vast world is theirs. END
BEGIN NOW Troy is too narrow for thy name." He said, END
BEGIN NOW And plunging downward shot his radiant head; END
BEGIN NOW Dispell'd the breathing air, that broke his flight: END
BEGIN NOW Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight. END
BEGIN NOW Old Butes' form he took, Anchises' squire, END
BEGIN NOW Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire: END
BEGIN NOW His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs, END
BEGIN NOW His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears, END
BEGIN NOW And thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years: END
BEGIN NOW Suffice it thee, thy father's worthy son, END
BEGIN NOW The warlike prize thou hast already won. END
BEGIN NOW The god of archers gives thy youth a part END
BEGIN NOW Of his own praise, nor envies equal art. END
BEGIN NOW Now tempt the war no more." He said, and flew END
BEGIN NOW Obscure in air, and vanish'd from their view. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojans, by his arms, their patron know, END
BEGIN NOW And hear the twanging of his heav'nly bow. END
BEGIN NOW Then duteous force they use, and Phoebus' name, END
BEGIN NOW To keep from fight the youth too fond of fame. END
BEGIN NOW Undaunted, they themselves no danger shun; END
BEGIN NOW From wall to wall the shouts and clamors run. END
BEGIN NOW They bend their bows; they whirl their slings around; END
BEGIN NOW Heaps of spent arrows fall, and strew the ground; END
BEGIN NOW And helms, and shields, and rattling arms resound. END
BEGIN NOW The combat thickens, like the storm that flies END
BEGIN NOW From westward, when the show'ry Kids arise; END
BEGIN NOW Or patt'ring hail comes pouring on the main, END
BEGIN NOW When Jupiter descends in harden'd rain, END
BEGIN NOW Or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound, END
BEGIN NOW And with an armed winter strew the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Pand'rus and Bitias, thunderbolts of war, END
BEGIN NOW Whom Hiera to bold Alcanor bare END
BEGIN NOW On Ida's top, two youths of height and size END
BEGIN NOW Like firs that on their mother mountain rise, END
BEGIN NOW Presuming on their force, the gates unbar, END
BEGIN NOW And of their own accord invite the war. END
BEGIN NOW With fates averse, against their king's command, END
BEGIN NOW Arm'd, on the right and on the left they stand, END
BEGIN NOW And flank the passage: shining steel they wear, END
BEGIN NOW And waving crests above their heads appear. END
BEGIN NOW Thus two tall oaks, that Padus' banks adorn, END
BEGIN NOW Lift up to heav'n their leafy heads unshorn, END
BEGIN NOW And, overpress'd with nature's heavy load, END
BEGIN NOW Dance to the whistling winds, and at each other nod. END
BEGIN NOW In flows a tide of Latians, when they see END
BEGIN NOW The gate set open, and the passage free; END
BEGIN NOW Bold Quercens, with rash Tmarus, rushing on, END
BEGIN NOW Equicolus, that in bright armor shone, END
BEGIN NOW And Haemon first; but soon repuls'd they fly, END
BEGIN NOW Or in the well-defended pass they die. END
BEGIN NOW These with success are fir'd, and those with rage, END
BEGIN NOW And each on equal terms at length ingage. END
BEGIN NOW Drawn from their lines, and issuing on the plain, END
BEGIN NOW The Trojans hand to hand the fight maintain. END
BEGIN NOW Fierce Turnus in another quarter fought, END
BEGIN NOW When suddenly th' unhop'd-for news was brought, END
BEGIN NOW The foes had left the fastness of their place, END
BEGIN NOW Prevail'd in fight, and had his men in chase. END
BEGIN NOW He quits th' attack, and, to prevent their fate, END
BEGIN NOW Runs where the giant brothers guard the gate. END
BEGIN NOW The first he met, Antiphates the brave, END
BEGIN NOW But base-begotten on a Theban slave, END
BEGIN NOW Sarpedon's son, he slew: the deadly dart END
BEGIN NOW Found passage thro' his breast, and pierc'd his heart. END
BEGIN NOW Fix'd in the wound th' Italian cornel stood, END
BEGIN NOW Warm'd in his lungs, and in his vital blood. END
BEGIN NOW Aphidnus next, and Erymanthus dies, END
BEGIN NOW And Meropes, and the gigantic size END
BEGIN NOW Of Bitias, threat'ning with his ardent eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Not by the feeble dart he fell oppress'd END
BEGIN NOW (A dart were lost within that roomy breast), END
BEGIN NOW But from a knotted lance, large, heavy, strong, END
BEGIN NOW Which roar'd like thunder as it whirl'd along: END
BEGIN NOW Not two bull hides th' impetuous force withhold, END
BEGIN NOW Nor coat of double mail, with scales of gold. END
BEGIN NOW Down sunk the monster bulk and press'd the ground; END
BEGIN NOW His arms and clatt'ring shield on the vast body sound, END
BEGIN NOW Not with less ruin than the Bajan mole, END
BEGIN NOW Rais'd on the seas, the surges to control- END
BEGIN NOW At once comes tumbling down the rocky wall; END
BEGIN NOW Prone to the deep, the stones disjointed fall END
BEGIN NOW Of the vast pile; the scatter'd ocean flies; END
BEGIN NOW Black sands, discolor'd froth, and mingled mud arise: END
BEGIN NOW The frighted billows roll, and seek the shores; END
BEGIN NOW Then trembles Prochyta, then Ischia roars: END
BEGIN NOW Typhoeus, thrown beneath, by Jove's command, END
BEGIN NOW Astonish'd at the flaw that shakes the land, END
BEGIN NOW Soon shifts his weary side, and, scarce awake, END
BEGIN NOW With wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back. END
BEGIN NOW The warrior god the Latian troops inspir'd, END
BEGIN NOW New strung their sinews, and their courage fir'd, END
BEGIN NOW But chills the Trojan hearts with cold affright: END
BEGIN NOW Then black despair precipitates their flight. END
BEGIN NOW When Pandarus beheld his brother kill'd, END
BEGIN NOW The town with fear and wild confusion fill'd, END
BEGIN NOW He turns the hinges of the heavy gate END
BEGIN NOW With both his hands, and adds his shoulders to the weight END
BEGIN NOW Some happier friends within the walls inclos'd; END
BEGIN NOW The rest shut out, to certain death expos'd: END
BEGIN NOW Fool as he was, and frantic in his care, END
BEGIN NOW T' admit young Turnus, and include the war! END
BEGIN NOW He thrust amid the crowd, securely bold, END
BEGIN NOW Like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold. END
BEGIN NOW Too late his blazing buckler they descry, END
BEGIN NOW And sparkling fires that shot from either eye, END
BEGIN NOW His mighty members, and his ample breast, END
BEGIN NOW His rattling armor, and his crimson crest. END
BEGIN NOW Far from that hated face the Trojans fly, END
BEGIN NOW All but the fool who sought his destiny. END
BEGIN NOW Mad Pandarus steps forth, with vengeance vow'd END
BEGIN NOW For Bitias' death, and threatens thus aloud: END
BEGIN NOW These are not Ardea's walls, nor this the town END
BEGIN NOW Amata proffers with Lavinia's crown: END
BEGIN NOW 'T is hostile earth you tread. Of hope bereft, END
BEGIN NOW No means of safe return by flight are left. END
BEGIN NOW To whom, with count'nance calm, and soul sedate, END
BEGIN NOW Thus Turnus: "Then begin, and try thy fate: END
BEGIN NOW My message to the ghost of Priam bear; END
BEGIN NOW Tell him a new Achilles sent thee there. END
BEGIN NOW A lance of tough ground ash the Trojan threw, END
BEGIN NOW Rough in the rind, and knotted as it grew: END
BEGIN NOW With his full force he whirl'd it first around; END
BEGIN NOW But the soft yielding air receiv'd the wound: END
BEGIN NOW Imperial Juno turn'd the course before, END
BEGIN NOW And fix'd the wand'ring weapon in the door. END
BEGIN NOW But hope not thou," said Turnus, "when I strike, END
BEGIN NOW To shun thy fate: our force is not alike, END
BEGIN NOW Nor thy steel temper'd by the Lemnian god. END
BEGIN NOW Then rising, on his utmost stretch he stood, END
BEGIN NOW And aim'd from high: the full descending blow END
BEGIN NOW Cleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in two. END
BEGIN NOW Down sinks the giant with a thund'ring sound: END
BEGIN NOW His pond'rous limbs oppress the trembling ground; END
BEGIN NOW Blood, brains, and foam gush from the gaping wound: END
BEGIN NOW Scalp, face, and shoulders the keen steel divides, END
BEGIN NOW And the shar'd visage hangs on equal sides. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojans fly from their approaching fate; END
BEGIN NOW And, had the victor then secur'd the gate, END
BEGIN NOW And to his troops without unclos'd the bars, END
BEGIN NOW One lucky day had ended all his wars. END
BEGIN NOW But boiling youth, and blind desire of blood, END
BEGIN NOW Push'd on his fury, to pursue the crowd. END
BEGIN NOW Hamstring'd behind, unhappy Gyges died; END
BEGIN NOW Then Phalaris is added to his side. END
BEGIN NOW The pointed jav'lins from the dead he drew, END
BEGIN NOW And their friends' arms against their fellows threw. END
BEGIN NOW Strong Halys stands in vain; weak Phlegys flies; END
BEGIN NOW Saturnia, still at hand, new force and fire supplies. END
BEGIN NOW Then Halius, Prytanis, Alcander fall- END
BEGIN NOW Ingag'd against the foes who scal'd the wall: END
BEGIN NOW But, whom they fear'd without, they found within. END
BEGIN NOW At last, tho' late, by Lynceus he was seen. END
BEGIN NOW He calls new succors, and assaults the prince: END
BEGIN NOW But weak his force, and vain is their defense. END
BEGIN NOW Turn'd to the right, his sword the hero drew, END
BEGIN NOW And at one blow the bold aggressor slew. END
BEGIN NOW He joints the neck; and, with a stroke so strong, END
BEGIN NOW The helm flies off, and bears the head along. END
BEGIN NOW Next him, the huntsman Amycus he kill'd, END
BEGIN NOW In darts invenom'd and in poison skill'd. END
BEGIN NOW Then Clytius fell beneath his fatal spear, END
BEGIN NOW And Creteus, whom the Muses held so dear: END
BEGIN NOW He fought with courage, and he sung the fight; END
BEGIN NOW Arms were his bus'ness, verses his delight. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan chiefs behold, with rage and grief, END
BEGIN NOW Their slaughter'd friends, and hasten their relief. END
BEGIN NOW Bold Mnestheus rallies first the broken train, END
BEGIN NOW Whom brave Seresthus and his troop sustain. END
BEGIN NOW To save the living, and revenge the dead, END
BEGIN NOW Against one warrior's arms all Troy they led. END
BEGIN NOW O, void of sense and courage!" Mnestheus cried, END
BEGIN NOW Where can you hope your coward heads to hide? END
BEGIN NOW Ah! where beyond these rampires can you run? END
BEGIN NOW One man, and in your camp inclos'd, you shun! END
BEGIN NOW Shall then a single sword such slaughter boast, END
BEGIN NOW And pass unpunish'd from a num'rous host? END
BEGIN NOW Forsaking honor, and renouncing fame, END
BEGIN NOW Your gods, your country, and your king you shame! END
BEGIN NOW This just reproach their virtue does excite: END
BEGIN NOW They stand, they join, they thicken to the fight. END
BEGIN NOW Now Turnus doubts, and yet disdains to yield, END
BEGIN NOW But with slow paces measures back the field, END
BEGIN NOW And inches to the walls, where Tiber's tide, END
BEGIN NOW Washing the camp, defends the weaker side. END
BEGIN NOW The more he loses, they advance the more, END
BEGIN NOW And tread in ev'ry step he trod before. END
BEGIN NOW They shout: they bear him back; and, whom by might END
BEGIN NOW They cannot conquer, they oppress with weight. END
BEGIN NOW As, compass'd with a wood of spears around, END
BEGIN NOW The lordly lion still maintains his ground; END
BEGIN NOW Grins horrible, retires, and turns again; END
BEGIN NOW Threats his distended paws, and shakes his mane; END
BEGIN NOW He loses while in vain he presses on, END
BEGIN NOW Nor will his courage let him dare to run: END
BEGIN NOW So Turnus fares, and, unresolved of flight, END
BEGIN NOW Yet twice, inrag'd, the combat he renews, END
BEGIN NOW Twice breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues. END
BEGIN NOW But now they swarm, and, with fresh troops supplied, END
BEGIN NOW Come rolling on, and rush from ev'ry side: END
BEGIN NOW Nor Juno, who sustain'd his arms before, END
BEGIN NOW Dares with new strength suffice th' exhausted store; END
BEGIN NOW For Jove, with sour commands, sent Iris down, END
BEGIN NOW To force th' invader from the frighted town. END
BEGIN NOW With labor spent, no longer can he wield END
BEGIN NOW The heavy fanchion, or sustain the shield, END
BEGIN NOW O'erwhelm'd with darts, which from afar they fling: END
BEGIN NOW The weapons round his hollow temples ring; END
BEGIN NOW His golden helm gives way, with stony blows END
BEGIN NOW Batter'd, and flat, and beaten to his brows. END
BEGIN NOW His crest is rash'd away; his ample shield END
BEGIN NOW Is falsified, and round with jav'lins fill'd. END
BEGIN NOW The foe, now faint, the Trojans overwhelm; END
BEGIN NOW And Mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm. END
BEGIN NOW Sick sweat succeeds; he drops at ev'ry pore; END
BEGIN NOW With driving dust his cheeks are pasted o'er; END
BEGIN NOW Shorter and shorter ev'ry gasp he takes; END
BEGIN NOW And vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes. END
BEGIN NOW Plung'd in the flood, and made the waters fly. END
BEGIN NOW The yellow god the welcome burthen bore, END
BEGIN NOW And wip'd the sweat, and wash'd away the gore; END
BEGIN NOW Then gently wafts him to the farther coast, END
BEGIN NOW And sends him safe to cheer his anxious host. END
BEGIN NOW The gates of heav'n unfold: Jove summons all END
BEGIN NOW The gods to council in the common hall. END
BEGIN NOW Sublimely seated, he surveys from far END
BEGIN NOW The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war, END
BEGIN NOW And all th' inferior world. From first to last, END
BEGIN NOW The sov'reign senate in degrees are plac'd. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus th' almighty sire began: "Ye gods, END
BEGIN NOW Natives or denizens of blest abodes, END
BEGIN NOW From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind, END
BEGIN NOW This backward fate from what was first design'd? END
BEGIN NOW Why this protracted war, when my commands END
BEGIN NOW Pronounc'd a peace, and gave the Latian lands? END
BEGIN NOW What fear or hope on either part divides END
BEGIN NOW Our heav'ns, and arms our powers on diff'rent sides? END
BEGIN NOW A lawful time of war at length will come, END
BEGIN NOW (Nor need your haste anticipate the doom), END
BEGIN NOW When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome, END
BEGIN NOW Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains, END
BEGIN NOW And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains. END
BEGIN NOW Then is your time for faction and debate, END
BEGIN NOW For partial favor, and permitted hate. END
BEGIN NOW Let now your immature dissension cease; END
BEGIN NOW Sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge; END
BEGIN NOW But lovely Venus thus replies at large: END
BEGIN NOW O pow'r immense, eternal energy, END
BEGIN NOW (For to what else protection can we fly?) END
BEGIN NOW Seest thou the proud Rutulians, how they dare END
BEGIN NOW In fields, unpunish'd, and insult my care? END
BEGIN NOW How lofty Turnus vaunts amidst his train, END
BEGIN NOW In shining arms, triumphant on the plain? END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n in their lines and trenches they contend, END
BEGIN NOW And scarce their walls the Trojan troops defend: END
BEGIN NOW The town is fill'd with slaughter, and o'erfloats, END
BEGIN NOW With a red deluge, their increasing moats. END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas, ignorant, and far from thence, END
BEGIN NOW Has left a camp expos'd, without defense. END
BEGIN NOW This endless outrage shall they still sustain? END
BEGIN NOW Shall Troy renew'd be forc'd and fir'd again? END
BEGIN NOW A second siege my banish'd issue fears, END
BEGIN NOW And a new Diomede in arms appears. END
BEGIN NOW One more audacious mortal will be found; END
BEGIN NOW And I, thy daughter, wait another wound. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, if with fates averse, without thy leave, END
BEGIN NOW The Latian lands my progeny receive, END
BEGIN NOW Bear they the pains of violated law, END
BEGIN NOW And thy protection from their aid withdraw. END
BEGIN NOW But, if the gods their sure success foretell; END
BEGIN NOW If those of heav'n consent with those of hell, END
BEGIN NOW To promise Italy; who dare debate END
BEGIN NOW The pow'r of Jove, or fix another fate? END
BEGIN NOW What should I tell of tempests on the main, END
BEGIN NOW Of Aeolus usurping Neptune's reign? END
BEGIN NOW Of Iris sent, with Bacchanalian heat END
BEGIN NOW T' inspire the matrons, and destroy the fleet? END
BEGIN NOW Now Juno to the Stygian sky descends, END
BEGIN NOW Solicits hell for aid, and arms the fiends. END
BEGIN NOW That new example wanted yet above: END
BEGIN NOW An act that well became the wife of Jove! END
BEGIN NOW Alecto, rais'd by her, with rage inflames END
BEGIN NOW The peaceful bosoms of the Latian dames. END
BEGIN NOW Imperial sway no more exalts my mind; END
BEGIN NOW (Such hopes I had indeed, while Heav'n was kind;) END
BEGIN NOW Now let my happier foes possess my place, END
BEGIN NOW Whom Jove prefers before the Trojan race; END
BEGIN NOW And conquer they, whom you with conquest grace. END
BEGIN NOW Since you can spare, from all your wide command, END
BEGIN NOW No spot of earth, no hospitable land, END
BEGIN NOW Which may my wand'ring fugitives receive; END
BEGIN NOW (Since haughty Juno will not give you leave;) END
BEGIN NOW Then, father, (if I still may use that name,) END
BEGIN NOW By ruin'd Troy, yet smoking from the flame, END
BEGIN NOW I beg you, let Ascanius, by my care, END
BEGIN NOW Be freed from danger, and dismiss'd the war: END
BEGIN NOW Inglorious let him live, without a crown. END
BEGIN NOW The father may be cast on coasts unknown, END
BEGIN NOW Struggling with fate; but let me save the son. END
BEGIN NOW Mine is Cythera, mine the Cyprian tow'rs: END
BEGIN NOW In those recesses, and those sacred bow'rs, END
BEGIN NOW Obscurely let him rest; his right resign END
BEGIN NOW To promis'd empire, and his Julian line. END
BEGIN NOW Then Carthage may th' Ausonian towns destroy, END
BEGIN NOW Nor fear the race of a rejected boy. END
BEGIN NOW What profits it my son to scape the fire, END
BEGIN NOW Arm'd with his gods, and loaded with his sire; END
BEGIN NOW To pass the perils of the seas and wind; END
BEGIN NOW Evade the Greeks, and leave the war behind; END
BEGIN NOW To reach th' Italian shores; if, after all, END
BEGIN NOW Our second Pergamus is doom'd to fall? END
BEGIN NOW Much better had he curb'd his high desires, END
BEGIN NOW And hover'd o'er his ill-extinguish'd fires. END
BEGIN NOW To Simois' banks the fugitives restore, END
BEGIN NOW And give them back to war, and all the woes before. END
BEGIN NOW Deep indignation swell'd Saturnia's heart: END
BEGIN NOW And must I own," she said, "my secret smart- END
BEGIN NOW What with more decence were in silence kept, END
BEGIN NOW And, but for this unjust reproach, had slept? END
BEGIN NOW Did god or man your fav'rite son advise, END
BEGIN NOW With war unhop'd the Latians to surprise? END
BEGIN NOW By fate, you boast, and by the gods' decree, END
BEGIN NOW He left his native land for Italy! END
BEGIN NOW Confess the truth; by mad Cassandra, more END
BEGIN NOW Than Heav'n inspir'd, he sought a foreign shore! END
BEGIN NOW Did I persuade to trust his second Troy END
BEGIN NOW To the raw conduct of a beardless boy, END
BEGIN NOW With walls unfinish'd, which himself forsakes, END
BEGIN NOW And thro' the waves a wand'ring voyage takes? END
BEGIN NOW When have I urg'd him meanly to demand END
BEGIN NOW The Tuscan aid, and arm a quiet land? END
BEGIN NOW Did I or Iris give this mad advice, END
BEGIN NOW Or made the fool himself the fatal choice? END
BEGIN NOW You think it hard, the Latians should destroy END
BEGIN NOW With swords your Trojans, and with fires your Troy! END
BEGIN NOW Hard and unjust indeed, for men to draw END
BEGIN NOW Their native air, nor take a foreign law! END
BEGIN NOW That Turnus is permitted still to live, END
BEGIN NOW To whom his birth a god and goddess give! END
BEGIN NOW But yet is just and lawful for your line END
BEGIN NOW To drive their fields, and force with fraud to join; END
BEGIN NOW Realms, not your own, among your clans divide, END
BEGIN NOW And from the bridegroom tear the promis'd bride; END
BEGIN NOW Petition, while you public arms prepare; END
BEGIN NOW Pretend a peace, and yet provoke a war! END
BEGIN NOW 'T was giv'n to you, your darling son to shroud, END
BEGIN NOW And, for a man, obtend an empty cloud. END
BEGIN NOW From flaming fleets you turn'd the fire away, END
BEGIN NOW And chang'd the ships to daughters of the sea. END
BEGIN NOW But is my crime- the Queen of Heav'n offends, END
BEGIN NOW If she presume to save her suff'ring friends! END
BEGIN NOW Your son, not knowing what his foes decree, END
BEGIN NOW You say, is absent: absent let him be. END
BEGIN NOW Yours is Cythera, yours the Cyprian tow'rs, END
BEGIN NOW The soft recesses, and the sacred bow'rs. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you then these needless arms prepare, END
BEGIN NOW And thus provoke a people prone to war? END
BEGIN NOW Did I with fire the Trojan town deface, END
BEGIN NOW Or hinder from return your exil'd race? END
BEGIN NOW Was I the cause of mischief, or the man END
BEGIN NOW Whose lawless lust the fatal war began? END
BEGIN NOW Think on whose faith th' adult'rous youth relied; END
BEGIN NOW Who promis'd, who procur'd, the Spartan bride? END
BEGIN NOW When all th' united states of Greece combin'd, END
BEGIN NOW To purge the world of the perfidious kind, END
BEGIN NOW Then was your time to fear the Trojan fate: END
BEGIN NOW Your quarrels and complaints are now too late. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Juno. Murmurs rise, with mix'd applause, END
BEGIN NOW Just as they favor or dislike the cause. END
BEGIN NOW So winds, when yet unfledg'd in woods they lie, END
BEGIN NOW In whispers first their tender voices try, END
BEGIN NOW Then issue on the main with bellowing rage, END
BEGIN NOW And storms to trembling mariners presage. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus to both replied th' imperial god, END
BEGIN NOW Who shakes heav'n's axles with his awful nod. END
BEGIN NOW (When he begins, the silent senate stand END
BEGIN NOW With rev'rence, list'ning to the dread command: END
BEGIN NOW The clouds dispel; the winds their breath restrain; END
BEGIN NOW And the hush'd waves lie flatted on the main.) END
BEGIN NOW Celestials, your attentive ears incline! END
BEGIN NOW Since, said the god, "the Trojans must not join END
BEGIN NOW In wish'd alliance with the Latian line; END
BEGIN NOW Since endless jarrings and immortal hate END
BEGIN NOW Tend but to discompose our happy state; END
BEGIN NOW The war henceforward be resign'd to fate: END
BEGIN NOW Each to his proper fortune stand or fall; END
BEGIN NOW Equal and unconcern'd I look on all. END
BEGIN NOW Rutulians, Trojans, are the same to me; END
BEGIN NOW And both shall draw the lots their fates decree. END
BEGIN NOW Let these assault, if Fortune be their friend; END
BEGIN NOW And, if she favors those, let those defend: END
BEGIN NOW The Fates will find their way." The Thund'rer said, END
BEGIN NOW And shook the sacred honors of his head, END
BEGIN NOW Attesting Styx, th' inviolable flood, END
BEGIN NOW And the black regions of his brother god. END
BEGIN NOW Trembled the poles of heav'n, and earth confess'd the nod. END
BEGIN NOW This end the sessions had: the senate rise, END
BEGIN NOW And to his palace wait their sov'reign thro' the skies. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime, intent upon their siege, the foes END
BEGIN NOW Within their walls the Trojan host inclose: END
BEGIN NOW They wound, they kill, they watch at ev'ry gate; END
BEGIN NOW Renew the fires, and urge their happy fate. END
BEGIN NOW Th' Aeneans wish in vain their wanted chief, END
BEGIN NOW Hopeless of flight, more hopeless of relief. END
BEGIN NOW Thin on the tow'rs they stand; and ev'n those few END
BEGIN NOW A feeble, fainting, and dejected crew. END
BEGIN NOW Yet in the face of danger some there stood: END
BEGIN NOW The two bold brothers of Sarpedon's blood, END
BEGIN NOW Asius and Acmon; both th' Assaraci; END
BEGIN NOW Young Haemon, and tho' young, resolv'd to die. END
BEGIN NOW With these were Clarus and Thymoetes join'd; END
BEGIN NOW Tibris and Castor, both of Lycian kind. END
BEGIN NOW From Acmon's hands a rolling stone there came, END
BEGIN NOW So large, it half deserv'd a mountain's name: END
BEGIN NOW Strong-sinew'd was the youth, and big of bone; END
BEGIN NOW His brother Mnestheus could not more have done, END
BEGIN NOW Or the great father of th' intrepid son. END
BEGIN NOW Some firebrands throw, some flights of arrows send; END
BEGIN NOW And some with darts, and some with stones defend. END
BEGIN NOW Amid the press appears the beauteous boy, END
BEGIN NOW The care of Venus, and the hope of Troy. END
BEGIN NOW His lovely face unarm'd, his head was bare; END
BEGIN NOW In ringlets o'er his shoulders hung his hair. END
BEGIN NOW His forehead circled with a diadem; END
BEGIN NOW Distinguish'd from the crowd, he shines a gem, END
BEGIN NOW Enchas'd in gold, or polish'd iv'ry set, END
BEGIN NOW Amidst the meaner foil of sable jet. END
BEGIN NOW Nor Ismarus was wanting to the war, END
BEGIN NOW Directing pointed arrows from afar, END
BEGIN NOW And death with poison arm'd- in Lydia born, END
BEGIN NOW Where plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn; END
BEGIN NOW Where proud Pactolus floats the fruitful lands, END
BEGIN NOW And leaves a rich manure of golden sands. END
BEGIN NOW There Capys, author of the Capuan name, END
BEGIN NOW And there was Mnestheus too, increas'd in fame, END
BEGIN NOW Since Turnus from the camp he cast with shame. END
BEGIN NOW Thus mortal war was wag'd on either side. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide: END
BEGIN NOW For, anxious, from Evander when he went, END
BEGIN NOW He sought the Tyrrhene camp, and Tarchon's tent; END
BEGIN NOW Expos'd the cause of coming to the chief; END
BEGIN NOW His name and country told, and ask'd relief; END
BEGIN NOW Propos'd the terms; his own small strength declar'd; END
BEGIN NOW What vengeance proud Mezentius had prepar'd: END
BEGIN NOW What Turnus, bold and violent, design'd; END
BEGIN NOW Then shew'd the slipp'ry state of humankind, END
BEGIN NOW And fickle fortune; warn'd him to beware, END
BEGIN NOW And to his wholesome counsel added pray'r. END
BEGIN NOW Tarchon, without delay, the treaty signs, END
BEGIN NOW And to the Trojan troops the Tuscan joins. END
BEGIN NOW They soon set sail; nor now the fates withstand; END
BEGIN NOW Their forces trusted with a foreign hand. END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas leads; upon his stern appear END
BEGIN NOW Two lions carv'd, which rising Ida bear- END
BEGIN NOW Ida, to wand'ring Trojans ever dear. END
BEGIN NOW Under their grateful shade Aeneas sate, END
BEGIN NOW Revolving war's events, and various fate. END
BEGIN NOW His left young Pallas kept, fix'd to his side, END
BEGIN NOW And oft of winds enquir'd, and of the tide; END
BEGIN NOW Oft of the stars, and of their wat'ry way; END
BEGIN NOW And what he suffer'd both by land and sea. END
BEGIN NOW Now, sacred sisters, open all your spring! END
BEGIN NOW The Tuscan leaders, and their army sing, END
BEGIN NOW Which follow'd great Aeneas to the war: END
BEGIN NOW Their arms, their numbers, and their names declare. END
BEGIN NOW A thousand youths brave Massicus obey, END
BEGIN NOW Borne in the Tiger thro' the foaming sea; END
BEGIN NOW From Asium brought, and Cosa, by his care: END
BEGIN NOW For arms, light quivers, bows and shafts, they bear. END
BEGIN NOW Fierce Abas next: his men bright armor wore; END
BEGIN NOW His stern Apollo's golden statue bore. END
BEGIN NOW Six hundred Populonia sent along, END
BEGIN NOW All skill'd in martial exercise, and strong. END
BEGIN NOW Three hundred more for battle Ilva joins, END
BEGIN NOW An isle renown'd for steel, and unexhausted mines. END
BEGIN NOW Asylas on his prow the third appears, END
BEGIN NOW Who heav'n interprets, and the wand'ring stars; END
BEGIN NOW From offer'd entrails prodigies expounds, END
BEGIN NOW And peals of thunder, with presaging sounds. END
BEGIN NOW A thousand spears in warlike order stand, END
BEGIN NOW Sent by the Pisans under his command. END
BEGIN NOW Fair Astur follows in the wat'ry field, END
BEGIN NOW Proud of his manag'd horse and painted shield. END
BEGIN NOW Gravisca, noisome from the neighb'ring fen, END
BEGIN NOW And his own Caere, sent three hundred men; END
BEGIN NOW With those which Minio's fields and Pyrgi gave, END
BEGIN NOW All bred in arms, unanimous, and brave. END
BEGIN NOW Thou, Muse, the name of Cinyras renew, END
BEGIN NOW And brave Cupavo follow'd but by few; END
BEGIN NOW Whose helm confess'd the lineage of the man, END
BEGIN NOW And bore, with wings display'd, a silver swan. END
BEGIN NOW Love was the fault of his fam'd ancestry, END
BEGIN NOW Whose forms and fortunes in his ensigns fly. END
BEGIN NOW For Cycnus lov'd unhappy Phaeton, END
BEGIN NOW And sung his loss in poplar groves, alone, END
BEGIN NOW Beneath the sister shades, to soothe his grief. END
BEGIN NOW Heav'n heard his song, and hasten'd his relief, END
BEGIN NOW And chang'd to snowy plumes his hoary hair, END
BEGIN NOW And wing'd his flight, to chant aloft in air. END
BEGIN NOW His son Cupavo brush'd the briny flood: END
BEGIN NOW Upon his stern a brawny Centaur stood, END
BEGIN NOW Who heav'd a rock, and, threat'ning still to throw, END
BEGIN NOW With lifted hands alarm'd the seas below: END
BEGIN NOW They seem'd to fear the formidable sight, END
BEGIN NOW And roll'd their billows on, to speed his flight. END
BEGIN NOW Ocnus was next, who led his native train END
BEGIN NOW Of hardy warriors thro' the wat'ry plain: END
BEGIN NOW The son of Manto by the Tuscan stream, END
BEGIN NOW From whence the Mantuan town derives the name- END
BEGIN NOW An ancient city, but of mix'd descent: END
BEGIN NOW Three sev'ral tribes compose the government; END
BEGIN NOW Four towns are under each; but all obey END
BEGIN NOW The Mantuan laws, and own the Tuscan sway. END
BEGIN NOW Hate to Mezentius arm'd five hundred more, END
BEGIN NOW Whom Mincius from his sire Benacus bore: END
BEGIN NOW Mincius, with wreaths of reeds his forehead cover'd o'er. END
BEGIN NOW These grave Auletes leads: a hundred sweep END
BEGIN NOW With stretching oars at once the glassy deep. END
BEGIN NOW Him and his martial train the Triton bears; END
BEGIN NOW High on his poop the sea-green god appears: END
BEGIN NOW Frowning he seems his crooked shell to sound, END
BEGIN NOW And at the blast the billows dance around. END
BEGIN NOW A hairy man above the waist he shows; END
BEGIN NOW A porpoise tail beneath his belly grows; END
BEGIN NOW And ends a fish: his breast the waves divides, END
BEGIN NOW And froth and foam augment the murm'ring tides. END
BEGIN NOW Full thirty ships transport the chosen train END
BEGIN NOW For Troy's relief, and scour the briny main. END
BEGIN NOW Now was the world forsaken by the sun, END
BEGIN NOW And Phoebe half her nightly race had run. END
BEGIN NOW The careful chief, who never clos'd his eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Himself the rudder holds, the sails supplies. END
BEGIN NOW A choir of Nereids meet him on the flood, END
BEGIN NOW Once his own galleys, hewn from Ida's wood; END
BEGIN NOW But now, as many nymphs, the sea they sweep, END
BEGIN NOW As rode, before, tall vessels on the deep. END
BEGIN NOW They know him from afar; and in a ring END
BEGIN NOW Inclose the ship that bore the Trojan king. END
BEGIN NOW Cymodoce, whose voice excell'd the rest, END
BEGIN NOW Above the waves advanc'd her snowy breast; END
BEGIN NOW Her right hand stops the stern; her left divides END
BEGIN NOW The curling ocean, and corrects the tides. END
BEGIN NOW She spoke for all the choir, and thus began END
BEGIN NOW With pleasing words to warn th' unknowing man: END
BEGIN NOW Sleeps our lov'd lord? O goddess-born, awake! END
BEGIN NOW Spread ev'ry sail, pursue your wat'ry track, END
BEGIN NOW And haste your course. Your navy once were we, END
BEGIN NOW From Ida's height descending to the sea; END
BEGIN NOW Till Turnus, as at anchor fix'd we stood, END
BEGIN NOW Presum'd to violate our holy wood. END
BEGIN NOW Then, loos'd from shore, we fled his fires profane END
BEGIN NOW (Unwillingly we broke our master's chain), END
BEGIN NOW And since have sought you thro' the Tuscan main. END
BEGIN NOW The mighty Mother chang'd our forms to these, END
BEGIN NOW And gave us life immortal in the seas. END
BEGIN NOW But young Ascanius, in his camp distress'd, END
BEGIN NOW By your insulting foes is hardly press'd. END
BEGIN NOW Th' Arcadian horsemen, and Etrurian host, END
BEGIN NOW Advance in order on the Latian coast: END
BEGIN NOW To cut their way the Daunian chief designs, END
BEGIN NOW Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines. END
BEGIN NOW Thou, when the rosy morn restores the light, END
BEGIN NOW First arm thy soldiers for th' ensuing fight: END
BEGIN NOW Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield, END
BEGIN NOW And bear aloft th' impenetrable shield. END
BEGIN NOW To-morrow's sun, unless my skill be vain, END
BEGIN NOW Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain. END
BEGIN NOW Parting, she spoke; and with immortal force END
BEGIN NOW Push'd on the vessel in her wat'ry course; END
BEGIN NOW For well she knew the way. Impell'd behind, END
BEGIN NOW The ship flew forward, and outstripp'd the wind. END
BEGIN NOW The rest make up. Unknowing of the cause, END
BEGIN NOW The chief admires their speed, and happy omens draws. END
BEGIN NOW Then thus he pray'd, and fix'd on heav'n his eyes: END
BEGIN NOW Hear thou, great Mother of the deities. END
BEGIN NOW With turrets crown'd! (on Ida's holy hill END
BEGIN NOW Fierce tigers, rein'd and curb'd, obey thy will.) END
BEGIN NOW Firm thy own omens; lead us on to fight; END
BEGIN NOW And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right. END
BEGIN NOW He said no more. And now renewing day END
BEGIN NOW Had chas'd the shadows of the night away. END
BEGIN NOW He charg'd the soldiers, with preventing care, END
BEGIN NOW Their flags to follow, and their arms prepare; END
BEGIN NOW Warn'd of th' ensuing fight, and bade 'em hope the war. END
BEGIN NOW Now, his lofty poop, he view'd below END
BEGIN NOW His camp incompass'd, and th' inclosing foe. END
BEGIN NOW His blazing shield, imbrac'd, he held on high; END
BEGIN NOW The camp receive the sign, and with loud shouts reply. END
BEGIN NOW Hope arms their courage: from their tow'rs they throw END
BEGIN NOW Their darts with double force, and drive the foe. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, at the signal giv'n, the cranes arise END
BEGIN NOW Before the stormy south, and blacken all the skies. END
BEGIN NOW King Turnus wonder'd at the fight renew'd, END
BEGIN NOW Till, looking back, the Trojan fleet he view'd, END
BEGIN NOW The seas with swelling canvas cover'd o'er, END
BEGIN NOW And the swift ships descending on the shore. END
BEGIN NOW The Latians saw from far, with dazzled eyes, END
BEGIN NOW The radiant crest that seem'd in flames to rise, END
BEGIN NOW And dart diffusive fires around the field, END
BEGIN NOW And the keen glitt'ring the golden shield. END
BEGIN NOW Thus threat'ning comets, when by night they rise, END
BEGIN NOW Shoot sanguine streams, and sadden all the skies: END
BEGIN NOW So Sirius, flashing forth sinister lights, END
BEGIN NOW Pale humankind with plagues and with dry famine fright: END
BEGIN NOW Yet Turnus with undaunted mind is bent END
BEGIN NOW To man the shores, and hinder their descent, END
BEGIN NOW And thus awakes the courage of his friends: END
BEGIN NOW What you so long have wish'd, kind Fortune sends; END
BEGIN NOW In ardent arms to meet th' invading foe: END
BEGIN NOW You find, and find him at advantage now. END
BEGIN NOW Yours is the day: you need but only dare; END
BEGIN NOW Your swords will make you masters of the war. END
BEGIN NOW Your sires, your sons, your houses, and your lands, END
BEGIN NOW And dearest wifes, are all within your hands. END
BEGIN NOW Be mindful of the race from whence you came, END
BEGIN NOW And emulate in arms your fathers' fame. END
BEGIN NOW Now take the time, while stagg'ring yet they stand END
BEGIN NOW With feet unfirm, and prepossess the strand: END
BEGIN NOW Fortune befriends the bold." Nor more he said, END
BEGIN NOW But balanc'd whom to leave, and whom to lead; END
BEGIN NOW Then these elects, the landing to prevent; END
BEGIN NOW And those he leaves, to keep the city pent. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore: END
BEGIN NOW Some are by boats expos'd, by bridges more. END
BEGIN NOW With lab'ring oars they bear along the strand, END
BEGIN NOW Where the tide languishes, and leap aland. END
BEGIN NOW Tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes, END
BEGIN NOW And, where no ford he finds, no water fries, END
BEGIN NOW Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar, END
BEGIN NOW But smoothly slide along, and swell the shore, END
BEGIN NOW That course he steer'd, and thus he gave command: END
BEGIN NOW Here ply your oars, and at all hazard land: END
BEGIN NOW Force on the vessel, that her keel may wound END
BEGIN NOW This hated soil, and furrow hostile ground. END
BEGIN NOW Let me securely land- I ask no more; END
BEGIN NOW Then sink my ships, or shatter on the shore. END
BEGIN NOW This fiery speech inflames his fearful friends: END
BEGIN NOW They tug at ev'ry oar, and ev'ry stretcher bends; END
BEGIN NOW They run their ships aground; the vessels knock, END
BEGIN NOW (Thus forc'd ashore,) and tremble with the shock. END
BEGIN NOW Tarchon's alone was lost, that stranded stood, END
BEGIN NOW Stuck on a bank, and beaten by the flood: END
BEGIN NOW She breaks her back; the loosen'd sides give way, END
BEGIN NOW And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea. END
BEGIN NOW Their broken oars and floating planks withstand END
BEGIN NOW Their passage, while they labor to the land, END
BEGIN NOW And ebbing tides bear back upon th' uncertain sand. END
BEGIN NOW Now Turnus leads his troops without delay, END
BEGIN NOW Advancing to the margin of the sea. END
BEGIN NOW The trumpets sound: Aeneas first assail'd END
BEGIN NOW The clowns new-rais'd and raw, and soon prevail'd. END
BEGIN NOW Great Theron fell, an omen of the fight; END
BEGIN NOW Great Theron, large of limbs, of giant height. END
BEGIN NOW He first in open field defied the prince: END
BEGIN NOW But armor scal'd with gold was no defense END
BEGIN NOW Against the fated sword, which open'd wide END
BEGIN NOW His plated shield, and pierc'd his naked side. END
BEGIN NOW Next, Lichas fell, who, not like others born, END
BEGIN NOW Was from his wretched mother ripp'd and torn; END
BEGIN NOW Sacred, O Phoebus, from his birth to thee; END
BEGIN NOW For his beginning life from biting steel was free. END
BEGIN NOW Not far from him was Gyas laid along, END
BEGIN NOW Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong: END
BEGIN NOW Vain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assail'd, END
BEGIN NOW Nor valor nor Herculean arms avail'd, END
BEGIN NOW Nor their fam'd father, wont in war to go END
BEGIN NOW With great Alcides, while he toil'd below. END
BEGIN NOW The noisy Pharos next receiv'd his death: END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas writh'd his dart, and stopp'd his bawling breath. END
BEGIN NOW Then wretched Cydon had receiv'd his doom, END
BEGIN NOW Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom, END
BEGIN NOW And sought with lust obscene polluted joys: END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan sword had curd his love of boys, END
BEGIN NOW Had not his sev'n bold brethren stopp'd the course END
BEGIN NOW Of the fierce champions, with united force. END
BEGIN NOW Sev'n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound END
BEGIN NOW From his bright shield, some on his helmet sound: END
BEGIN NOW The rest had reach'd him; but his mother's care END
BEGIN NOW Prevented those, and turn'd aside in air. END
BEGIN NOW The prince then call'd Achates, to supply END
BEGIN NOW The spears that knew the way to victory- END
BEGIN NOW Those fatal weapons, which, inur'd to blood, END
BEGIN NOW In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood: END
BEGIN NOW Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain END
BEGIN NOW Against our foes, on this contended plain. END
BEGIN NOW He said; then seiz'd a mighty spear, and threw; END
BEGIN NOW Which, wing'd with fate, thro' Maeon's buckler flew, END
BEGIN NOW Pierc'd all the brazen plates, and reach'd his heart: END
BEGIN NOW He stagger'd with intolerable smart. END
BEGIN NOW Alcanor saw; and reach'd, but reach'd in vain, END
BEGIN NOW His helping hand, his brother to sustain. END
BEGIN NOW A second spear, which kept the former course, END
BEGIN NOW From the same hand, and sent with equal force, END
BEGIN NOW His right arm pierc'd, and holding on, bereft END
BEGIN NOW His use of both, and pinion'd down his left. END
BEGIN NOW Then Numitor from his dead brother drew END
BEGIN NOW Th' ill-omen'd spear, and at the Trojan threw: END
BEGIN NOW Preventing fate directs the lance awry, END
BEGIN NOW Which, glancing, only mark'd Achates' thigh. END
BEGIN NOW In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came, END
BEGIN NOW And, from afar, at Dryops took his aim. END
BEGIN NOW The spear flew hissing thro' the middle space, END
BEGIN NOW And pierc'd his throat, directed at his face; END
BEGIN NOW It stopp'd at once the passage of his wind, END
BEGIN NOW And the free soul to flitting air resign'd: END
BEGIN NOW His forehead was the first that struck the ground; END
BEGIN NOW Lifeblood and life rush'd mingled thro' the wound. END
BEGIN NOW He slew three brothers of the Borean race, END
BEGIN NOW And three, whom Ismarus, their native place, END
BEGIN NOW Had sent to war, but all the sons of Thrace. END
BEGIN NOW Halesus, next, the bold Aurunci leads: END
BEGIN NOW The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds, END
BEGIN NOW Conspicuous on his horse. On either hand, END
BEGIN NOW These fight to keep, and those to win, the land. END
BEGIN NOW With mutual blood th' Ausonian soil is dyed, END
BEGIN NOW While on its borders each their claim decide. END
BEGIN NOW As wintry winds, contending in the sky, END
BEGIN NOW With equal force of lungs their titles try: END
BEGIN NOW They rage, they roar; the doubtful rack of heav'n END
BEGIN NOW Stands without motion, and the tide undriv'n: END
BEGIN NOW Each bent to conquer, neither side to yield, END
BEGIN NOW They long suspend the fortune of the field. END
BEGIN NOW Both armies thus perform what courage can; END
BEGIN NOW Foot set to foot, and mingled man to man. END
BEGIN NOW But, in another part, th' Arcadian horse END
BEGIN NOW With ill success ingage the Latin force: END
BEGIN NOW For, where th' impetuous torrent, rushing down, END
BEGIN NOW Huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown, END
BEGIN NOW They left their coursers, and, unus'd to fight END
BEGIN NOW On foot, were scatter'd in a shameful flight. END
BEGIN NOW Pallas, who with disdain and grief had view'd END
BEGIN NOW His foes pursuing, and his friends pursued, END
BEGIN NOW Us'd threat'nings mix'd with pray'rs, his last resource, END
BEGIN NOW With these to move their minds, with those to fire their force END
BEGIN NOW Which way, companions? whether would you run? END
BEGIN NOW By you yourselves, and mighty battles won, END
BEGIN NOW By my great sire, by his establish'd name, END
BEGIN NOW And early promise of my future fame; END
BEGIN NOW By my youth, emulous of equal right END
BEGIN NOW To share his honors- shun ignoble flight! END
BEGIN NOW Trust not your feet: your hands must hew way END
BEGIN NOW Thro' yon black body, and that thick array: END
BEGIN NOW 'T is thro' that forward path that we must come; END
BEGIN NOW There lies our way, and that our passage home. END
BEGIN NOW Nor pow'rs above, nor destinies below END
BEGIN NOW Oppress our arms: with equal strength we go, END
BEGIN NOW With mortal hands to meet a mortal foe. END
BEGIN NOW See on what foot we stand: a scanty shore, END
BEGIN NOW The sea behind, our enemies before; END
BEGIN NOW No passage left, unless we swim the main; END
BEGIN NOW Or, forcing these, the Trojan trenches gain. END
BEGIN NOW This said, he strode with eager haste along, END
BEGIN NOW And bore amidst the thickest of the throng. END
BEGIN NOW Lagus, the first he met, with fate to foe, END
BEGIN NOW Had heav'd a stone of mighty weight, to throw: END
BEGIN NOW Stooping, the spear descended on his chine, END
BEGIN NOW Just where the bone distinguished either loin: END
BEGIN NOW It stuck so fast, so deeply buried lay, END
BEGIN NOW That scarce the victor forc'd the steel away. END
BEGIN NOW Hisbon came on: but, while he mov'd too slow END
BEGIN NOW To wish'd revenge, the prince prevents his blow; END
BEGIN NOW For, warding his at once, at once he press'd, END
BEGIN NOW And plung'd the fatal weapon in his breast. END
BEGIN NOW Then lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust, END
BEGIN NOW Who stain'd his stepdam's bed with impious lust. END
BEGIN NOW And, after him, the Daucian twins were slain, END
BEGIN NOW Laris and Thymbrus, on the Latian plain; END
BEGIN NOW So wondrous like in feature, shape, and size, END
BEGIN NOW As caus'd an error in their parents' eyes- END
BEGIN NOW Grateful mistake! but soon the sword decides END
BEGIN NOW The nice distinction, and their fate divides: END
BEGIN NOW For Thymbrus' head was lopp'd; and Laris' hand, END
BEGIN NOW Dismember'd, sought its owner on the strand: END
BEGIN NOW The trembling fingers yet the fauchion strain, END
BEGIN NOW And threaten still th' intended stroke in vain. END
BEGIN NOW Now, to renew the charge, th' Arcadians came: END
BEGIN NOW Sight of such acts, and sense of honest shame, END
BEGIN NOW And grief, with anger mix'd, their minds inflame. END
BEGIN NOW Then, with a casual blow was Rhoeteus slain, END
BEGIN NOW Who chanc'd, as Pallas threw, to cross the plain: END
BEGIN NOW The flying spear was after Ilus sent; END
BEGIN NOW But Rhoeteus happen'd on a death unmeant: END
BEGIN NOW From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled, END
BEGIN NOW The lance, athwart his body, laid him dead: END
BEGIN NOW Roll'd from his chariot with a mortal wound, END
BEGIN NOW And intercepted fate, he spurn'd the ground. END
BEGIN NOW As when, in summer, welcome winds arise, END
BEGIN NOW The watchful shepherd to the forest flies, END
BEGIN NOW And fires the midmost plants; contagion spreads, END
BEGIN NOW And catching flames infect the neighb'ring heads; END
BEGIN NOW Around the forest flies the furious blast, END
BEGIN NOW And all the leafy nation sinks at last, END
BEGIN NOW And Vulcan rides in triumph o'er the waste; END
BEGIN NOW The pastor, pleas'd with his dire victory, END
BEGIN NOW Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky: END
BEGIN NOW So Pallas' troops their scatter'd strength unite, END
BEGIN NOW And, pouring on their foes, their prince delight. END
BEGIN NOW Halesus came, fierce with desire of blood; END
BEGIN NOW But first collected in his arms he stood: END
BEGIN NOW Advancing then, he plied the spear so well, END
BEGIN NOW Ladon, Demodocus, and Pheres fell. END
BEGIN NOW Around his head he toss'd his glitt'ring brand, END
BEGIN NOW And from Strymonius hew'd his better hand, END
BEGIN NOW Held up to guard his throat; then hurl'd a stone END
BEGIN NOW At Thoas' ample front, and pierc'd the bone: END
BEGIN NOW It struck beneath the space of either eye; END
BEGIN NOW And blood, and mingled brains, together fly. END
BEGIN NOW Deep skill'd in future fates, Halesus' sire END
BEGIN NOW Did with the youth to lonely groves retire: END
BEGIN NOW But, when the father's mortal race was run, END
BEGIN NOW Dire destiny laid hold upon the son, END
BEGIN NOW And haul'd him to the war, to find, beneath END
BEGIN NOW Th' Evandrian spear, a memorable death. END
BEGIN NOW Pallas th' encounter seeks, but, ere he throws, END
BEGIN NOW To Tuscan Tiber thus address'd his vows: END
BEGIN NOW O sacred stream, direct my flying dart, END
BEGIN NOW And give to pass the proud Halesus' heart! END
BEGIN NOW His arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear. END
BEGIN NOW Pleas'd with the bribe, the god receiv'd his pray'r: END
BEGIN NOW For, while his shield protects a friend distress'd, END
BEGIN NOW The dart came driving on, and pierc'd his breast. END
BEGIN NOW But Lausus, no small portion of the war, END
BEGIN NOW Permits not panic fear to reign too far, END
BEGIN NOW Caus'd by the death of so renown'd a knight; END
BEGIN NOW But by his own example cheers the fight. END
BEGIN NOW Fierce Abas first he slew; Abas, the stay END
BEGIN NOW Of Trojan hopes, and hindrance of the day. END
BEGIN NOW The Phrygian troops escap'd the Greeks in vain: END
BEGIN NOW They, and their mix'd allies, now load the plain. END
BEGIN NOW To the rude shock of war both armies came; END
BEGIN NOW Their leaders equal, and their strength the same. END
BEGIN NOW The rear so press'd the front, they could not wield END
BEGIN NOW Their angry weapons, to dispute the field. END
BEGIN NOW Here Pallas urges on, and Lausus there: END
BEGIN NOW Of equal youth and beauty both appear, END
BEGIN NOW But both by fate forbid to breathe their native air. END
BEGIN NOW Their congress in the field great Jove withstands: END
BEGIN NOW Both doom'd to fall, but fall by greater hands. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief END
BEGIN NOW Of Lausus' danger, urging swift relief. END
BEGIN NOW With his driv'n chariot he divides the crowd, END
BEGIN NOW And, making to his friends, thus calls aloud: END
BEGIN NOW Let none presume his needless aid to join; END
BEGIN NOW Retire, and clear the field; the fight is mine: END
BEGIN NOW To this right hand is Pallas only due; END
BEGIN NOW O were his father here, my just revenge to view! END
BEGIN NOW From the forbidden space his men retir'd. END
BEGIN NOW Pallas their awe, and his stern words, admir'd; END
BEGIN NOW Survey'd him o'er and o'er with wond'ring sight, END
BEGIN NOW Struck with his haughty mien, and tow'ring height. END
BEGIN NOW Then to the king: "Your empty vaunts forbear; END
BEGIN NOW Success I hope, and fate I cannot fear; END
BEGIN NOW Alive or dead, I shall deserve a name; END
BEGIN NOW Jove is impartial, and to both the same. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and to the void advanc'd his pace: END
BEGIN NOW Pale horror sate on each Arcadian face. END
BEGIN NOW Then Turnus, from his chariot leaping light, END
BEGIN NOW Address'd himself on foot to single fight. END
BEGIN NOW And, as a lion- when he spies from far END
BEGIN NOW A bull that seems to meditate the war, END
BEGIN NOW Bending his neck, and spurning back the sand- END
BEGIN NOW Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand: END
BEGIN NOW Imagine eager Turnus not more slow, END
BEGIN NOW To rush from high on his unequal foe. END
BEGIN NOW Young Pallas, when he saw the chief advance END
BEGIN NOW Within due distance of his flying lance, END
BEGIN NOW Prepares to charge him first, resolv'd to try END
BEGIN NOW If fortune would his want of force supply; END
BEGIN NOW And thus to Heav'n and Hercules address'd: END
BEGIN NOW Alcides, once on earth Evander's guest, END
BEGIN NOW His son adjures you by those holy rites, END
BEGIN NOW That hospitable board, those genial nights; END
BEGIN NOW Assist my great attempt to gain this prize, END
BEGIN NOW And let proud Turnus view, with dying eyes, END
BEGIN NOW His ravish'd spoils." 'T was heard, the vain request; END
BEGIN NOW Alcides mourn'd, and stifled sighs within his breast. END
BEGIN NOW Then Jove, to soothe his sorrow, thus began: END
BEGIN NOW Short bounds of life are set to mortal man. END
BEGIN NOW 'T is virtue's work alone to stretch the narrow span. END
BEGIN NOW So many sons of gods, in bloody fight, END
BEGIN NOW Around the walls of Troy, have lost the light: END
BEGIN NOW My own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe; END
BEGIN NOW Nor I, his mighty sire, could ward the blow. END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n Turnus shortly shall resign his breath, END
BEGIN NOW And stands already on the verge of death. END
BEGIN NOW This said, the god permits the fatal fight, END
BEGIN NOW But from the Latian fields averts his sight. END
BEGIN NOW Now with full force his spear young Pallas threw, END
BEGIN NOW And, having thrown, his shining fauchion drew END
BEGIN NOW The steel just graz'd along the shoulder joint, END
BEGIN NOW And mark'd it slightly with the glancing point, END
BEGIN NOW Fierce Turnus first to nearer distance drew, END
BEGIN NOW And pois'd his pointed spear, before he threw: END
BEGIN NOW Then, as the winged weapon whizz'd along, END
BEGIN NOW See now," said he, "whose arm is better strung. END
BEGIN NOW The spear kept on the fatal course, unstay'd END
BEGIN NOW By plates of ir'n, which o'er the shield were laid: END
BEGIN NOW Thro' folded brass and tough bull hides it pass'd, END
BEGIN NOW His corslet pierc'd, and reach'd his heart at last. END
BEGIN NOW In vain the youth tugs at the broken wood; END
BEGIN NOW The soul comes issuing with the vital blood: END
BEGIN NOW He falls; his arms upon his body sound; END
BEGIN NOW And with his bloody teeth he bites the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Turnus bestrode the corpse: "Arcadians, hear, END
BEGIN NOW Said he; "my message to your master bear: END
BEGIN NOW Such as the sire deserv'd, the son I send; END
BEGIN NOW It costs him dear to be the Phrygians' friend. END
BEGIN NOW The lifeless body, tell him, I bestow, END
BEGIN NOW Unask'd, to rest his wand'ring ghost below. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and trampled down with all the force END
BEGIN NOW Of his left foot, and spurn'd the wretched corse; END
BEGIN NOW Then snatch'd the shining belt, with gold inlaid; END
BEGIN NOW The belt Eurytion's artful hands had made, END
BEGIN NOW Where fifty fatal brides, express'd to sight, END
BEGIN NOW All in the compass of one mournful night, END
BEGIN NOW Depriv'd their bridegrooms of returning light. END
BEGIN NOW In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore END
BEGIN NOW Those golden spoils, and in a worse he wore. END
BEGIN NOW O mortals, blind in fate, who never know END
BEGIN NOW To bear high fortune, or endure the low! END
BEGIN NOW The time shall come, when Turnus, but in vain, END
BEGIN NOW Shall wish untouch'd the trophies of the slain; END
BEGIN NOW Shall wish the fatal belt were far away, END
BEGIN NOW And curse the dire remembrance of the day. END
BEGIN NOW The sad Arcadians, from th' unhappy field, END
BEGIN NOW Bear back the breathless body on a shield. END
BEGIN NOW O grace and grief of war! at once restor'd, END
BEGIN NOW With praises, to thy sire, at once deplor'd! END
BEGIN NOW One day first sent thee to the fighting field, END
BEGIN NOW Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill'd; END
BEGIN NOW One day beheld thee dead, and borne upon thy shield. END
BEGIN NOW This dismal news, not from uncertain fame, END
BEGIN NOW But sad spectators, to the hero came: END
BEGIN NOW His friends upon the brink of ruin stand, END
BEGIN NOW Unless reliev'd by his victorious hand. END
BEGIN NOW He whirls his sword around, without delay, END
BEGIN NOW And hews thro' adverse foes an ample way, END
BEGIN NOW To find fierce Turnus, of his conquest proud: END
BEGIN NOW Evander, Pallas, all that friendship ow'd END
BEGIN NOW To large deserts, are present to his eyes; END
BEGIN NOW His plighted hand, and hospitable ties. END
BEGIN NOW Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred, END
BEGIN NOW He took in fight, and living victims led, END
BEGIN NOW To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire, END
BEGIN NOW In sacrifice, before his fun'ral fire. END
BEGIN NOW At Magus next he threw: he stoop'd below END
BEGIN NOW The flying spear, and shunn'd the promis'd blow; END
BEGIN NOW Then, creeping, clasp'd the hero's knees, and pray'd: END
BEGIN NOW By young Iulus, by thy father's shade, END
BEGIN NOW O spare my life, and send me back to see END
BEGIN NOW My longing sire, and tender progeny! END
BEGIN NOW A lofty house I have, and wealth untold, END
BEGIN NOW In silver ingots, and in bars of gold: END
BEGIN NOW All these, and sums besides, which see no day, END
BEGIN NOW The ransom of this one poor life shall pay. END
BEGIN NOW If I survive, will Troy the less prevail? END
BEGIN NOW A single soul's too light to turn the scale. END
BEGIN NOW He said. The hero sternly thus replied: END
BEGIN NOW Thy bars and ingots, and the sums beside, END
BEGIN NOW Leave for thy children's lot. Thy Turnus broke END
BEGIN NOW All rules of war by one relentless stroke, END
BEGIN NOW When Pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone END
BEGIN NOW My father's shadow, but my living son. END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, of kind remorse bereft, END
BEGIN NOW He seiz'd his helm, and dragg'd him with his left; END
BEGIN NOW Then with his right hand, while his neck he wreath'd, END
BEGIN NOW Up to the hilts his shining fauchion sheath'd. END
BEGIN NOW Apollo's priest, Emonides, was near; END
BEGIN NOW His holy fillets on his front appear; END
BEGIN NOW Glitt'ring in arms, he shone amidst the crowd; END
BEGIN NOW Much of his god, more of his purple, proud. END
BEGIN NOW Him the fierce Trojan follow'd thro' the field: END
BEGIN NOW The holy coward fell; and, forc'd to yield, END
BEGIN NOW The prince stood o'er the priest, and, at one blow, END
BEGIN NOW Sent him an off'ring to the shades below. END
BEGIN NOW His arms Seresthus on his shoulders bears, END
BEGIN NOW Design'd a trophy to the God of Wars. END
BEGIN NOW Vulcanian Caeculus renews the fight, END
BEGIN NOW And Umbro, born upon the mountains' height. END
BEGIN NOW The champion cheers his troops t' encounter those, END
BEGIN NOW And seeks revenge himself on other foes. END
BEGIN NOW At Anxur's shield he drove; and, at the blow, END
BEGIN NOW Both shield and arm to ground together go. END
BEGIN NOW Anxur had boasted much of magic charms, END
BEGIN NOW And thought he wore impenetrable arms, END
BEGIN NOW So made by mutter'd spells; and, from the spheres, END
BEGIN NOW Had life secur'd, in vain, for length of years. END
BEGIN NOW Then Tarquitus the field triumph trod; END
BEGIN NOW A nymph his mother, his sire a god. END
BEGIN NOW Exulting in bright arms, he braves the prince: END
BEGIN NOW With his protended lance he makes defense; END
BEGIN NOW Bears back his feeble foe; then, pressing on, END
BEGIN NOW Arrests his better hand, and drags him down; END
BEGIN NOW Stands o'er the prostrate wretch, and, as he lay, END
BEGIN NOW Vain tales inventing, and prepar'd to pray, END
BEGIN NOW Mows off his head: the trunk a moment stood, END
BEGIN NOW Then sunk, and roll'd along the sand in blood. END
BEGIN NOW The vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain: END
BEGIN NOW Lie there, proud man, unpitied, on the plain; END
BEGIN NOW Lie there, inglorious, and without a tomb, END
BEGIN NOW Far from thy mother and thy native home, END
BEGIN NOW Exposed to savage beasts, and birds of prey, END
BEGIN NOW Or thrown for food to monsters of the sea. END
BEGIN NOW On Lycas and Antaeus next he ran, END
BEGIN NOW Two chiefs of Turnus, and who led his van. END
BEGIN NOW They fled for fear; with these, he chas'd along END
BEGIN NOW Camers the yellow-lock'd, and Numa strong; END
BEGIN NOW Both great in arms, and both were fair and young. END
BEGIN NOW Camers was son to Volscens lately slain, END
BEGIN NOW In wealth surpassing all the Latian train, END
BEGIN NOW And in Amycla fix'd his silent easy reign. END
BEGIN NOW And, as Aegaeon, when with heav'n he strove, END
BEGIN NOW Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove; END
BEGIN NOW Mov'd all his hundred hands, provok'd the war, END
BEGIN NOW Defied the forky lightning from afar; END
BEGIN NOW At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires, END
BEGIN NOW And flash for flash returns, and fires for fires; END
BEGIN NOW In his right hand as many swords he wields, END
BEGIN NOW And takes the thunder on as many shields: END
BEGIN NOW With strength like his, the Trojan hero stood; END
BEGIN NOW And soon the fields with falling corps were strow'd, END
BEGIN NOW When once his fauchion found the taste of blood. END
BEGIN NOW With fury scarce to be conceiv'd, he flew END
BEGIN NOW Against Niphaeus, whom four coursers drew. END
BEGIN NOW They, when they see the fiery chief advance, END
BEGIN NOW And pushing at their chests his pointed lance, END
BEGIN NOW Wheel'd with so swift a motion, mad with fear, END
BEGIN NOW They threw their master headlong from the chair. END
BEGIN NOW They stare, they start, nor stop their course, before END
BEGIN NOW They bear the bounding chariot to the shore. END
BEGIN NOW Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains, END
BEGIN NOW With two white steeds; but Liger holds the reins, END
BEGIN NOW And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains: END
BEGIN NOW Bold brethren both. The former wav'd in air END
BEGIN NOW His flaming sword: Aeneas couch'd his spear, END
BEGIN NOW Unus'd to threats, and more unus'd to fear. END
BEGIN NOW Then Liger thus: "Thy confidence is vain END
BEGIN NOW To scape from hence, as from the Trojan plain: END
BEGIN NOW Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode, END
BEGIN NOW Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode; END
BEGIN NOW Nor Venus' veil is here, near Neptune's shield; END
BEGIN NOW Thy fatal hour is come, and this the field. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Liger vainly vaunts: the Trojan END
BEGIN NOW Return'd his answer with his flying spear. END
BEGIN NOW As Lucagus, to lash his horses, bends, END
BEGIN NOW Prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends, END
BEGIN NOW Prepar'd for fight; the fatal dart arrives, END
BEGIN NOW And thro' the borders of his buckler drives; END
BEGIN NOW Pass'd thro' and pierc'd his groin: the deadly wound, END
BEGIN NOW Cast from his chariot, roll'd him on the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite: END
BEGIN NOW Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight; END
BEGIN NOW Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat; END
BEGIN NOW But you yourself forsake your empty seat. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and seiz'd at once the loosen'd rein; END
BEGIN NOW For Liger lay already on the plain, END
BEGIN NOW By the same shock: then, stretching out his hands, END
BEGIN NOW The recreant thus his wretched life demands: END
BEGIN NOW Now, by thyself, O more than mortal man! END
BEGIN NOW By her and him from whom thy breath began, END
BEGIN NOW Who form'd thee thus divine, I beg thee, spare END
BEGIN NOW This forfeit life, and hear thy suppliant's pray'r. END
BEGIN NOW Thus much he spoke, and more he would have said; END
BEGIN NOW But the stern hero turn'd aside his head, END
BEGIN NOW And cut him short: "I hear another man; END
BEGIN NOW You talk'd not thus before the fight began. END
BEGIN NOW Now take your turn; and, as a brother should, END
BEGIN NOW Attend your brother to the Stygian flood. END
BEGIN NOW Then thro' his breast his fatal sword he sent, END
BEGIN NOW And the soul issued at the gaping vent. END
BEGIN NOW As storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground, END
BEGIN NOW Thus rag'd the prince, and scatter'd deaths around. END
BEGIN NOW At length Ascanius and the Trojan train END
BEGIN NOW Broke from the camp, so long besieg'd in vain. END
BEGIN NOW Held conference with his queen, and thus began: END
BEGIN NOW My sister goddess, and well-pleasing wife, END
BEGIN NOW Still think you Venus' aid supports the strife- END
BEGIN NOW Sustains her Trojans- or themselves, alone, END
BEGIN NOW With inborn valor force their fortune on? END
BEGIN NOW How fierce in fight, with courage undecay'd! END
BEGIN NOW Judge if such warriors want immortal aid. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the goddess with the charming eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Soft in her tone, submissively replies: END
BEGIN NOW Why, O my sov'reign lord, whose frown I fear, END
BEGIN NOW And cannot, unconcern'd, your anger bear; END
BEGIN NOW Why urge you thus my grief? when, if I still END
BEGIN NOW (As once I was) were mistress of your will, END
BEGIN NOW From your almighty pow'r your pleasing wife END
BEGIN NOW Might gain the grace of length'ning Turnus' life, END
BEGIN NOW Securely snatch him from the fatal fight, END
BEGIN NOW And give him to his aged father's sight. END
BEGIN NOW Now let him perish, since you hold it good, END
BEGIN NOW And glut the Trojans with his pious blood. END
BEGIN NOW Yet from our lineage he derives his name, END
BEGIN NOW And, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came; END
BEGIN NOW Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine, END
BEGIN NOW And offers daily incense at your shrine. END
BEGIN NOW Then shortly thus the sov'reign god replied: END
BEGIN NOW Since in my pow'r and goodness you confide, END
BEGIN NOW If for a little space, a lengthen'd span, END
BEGIN NOW You beg reprieve for this expiring man, END
BEGIN NOW I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence END
BEGIN NOW From instant fate, and can so far dispense. END
BEGIN NOW But, if some secret meaning lies beneath, END
BEGIN NOW To save the short-liv'd youth from destin'd death, END
BEGIN NOW Or if a farther thought you entertain, END
BEGIN NOW To change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes: END
BEGIN NOW And what if that request, your tongue denies, END
BEGIN NOW Your heart should grant; and not a short reprieve, END
BEGIN NOW But length of certain life, to Turnus give? END
BEGIN NOW Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth, END
BEGIN NOW If my presaging soul divines with truth; END
BEGIN NOW Which, O! I wish, might err thro' causeless fears, END
BEGIN NOW And you (for you have pow'r) prolong his years! END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, involv'd in clouds, she flies, END
BEGIN NOW And drives a storm before her thro' the skies. END
BEGIN NOW Swift she descends, alighting on the plain, END
BEGIN NOW Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain. END
BEGIN NOW Of air condens'd a specter soon she made; END
BEGIN NOW And, what Aeneas was, such seem'd the shade. END
BEGIN NOW Adorn'd with Dardan arms, the phantom bore END
BEGIN NOW His head aloft; a plumy crest he wore; END
BEGIN NOW This hand appear'd a shining sword to wield, END
BEGIN NOW And that sustain'd an imitated shield. END
BEGIN NOW With manly mien he stalk'd along the ground, END
BEGIN NOW Nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound. END
BEGIN NOW (Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight, END
BEGIN NOW Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night.) END
BEGIN NOW The specter seems the Daunian chief to dare, END
BEGIN NOW And flourishes his empty sword in air. END
BEGIN NOW At this, advancing, Turnus hurl'd his spear: END
BEGIN NOW The phantom wheel'd, and seem'd to fly for fear. END
BEGIN NOW Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled, END
BEGIN NOW And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed. END
BEGIN NOW Whether, O coward?" (thus he calls aloud, END
BEGIN NOW Nor found he spoke to wind, and chas'd a cloud,) END
BEGIN NOW Why thus forsake your bride! Receive from me END
BEGIN NOW The fated land you sought so long by sea. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and, brandishing at once his blade, END
BEGIN NOW With eager pace pursued the flying shade. END
BEGIN NOW By chance a ship was fasten'd to the shore, END
BEGIN NOW Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore: END
BEGIN NOW The plank was ready laid for safe ascent; END
BEGIN NOW For shelter there the trembling shadow bent, END
BEGIN NOW And skipp't and skulk'd, and under hatches went. END
BEGIN NOW Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste, END
BEGIN NOW Ascends the plank, and to the galley pass'd. END
BEGIN NOW Scarce had he reach'd the prow: Saturnia's hand END
BEGIN NOW The haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land. END
BEGIN NOW With wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea, END
BEGIN NOW And measures back with speed her former way. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe, END
BEGIN NOW And sends his slaughter'd troops to shades below. END
BEGIN NOW The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud, END
BEGIN NOW And flew sublime, and vanish'd in a cloud. END
BEGIN NOW Too late young Turnus the delusion found, END
BEGIN NOW Far on the sea, still making from the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Then, thankless for a life redeem'd by shame, END
BEGIN NOW With sense of honor stung, and forfeit fame, END
BEGIN NOW Fearful besides of what in fight had pass'd, END
BEGIN NOW His hands and haggard eyes to heav'n he cast; END
BEGIN NOW O Jove!" he cried, "for what offense have END
BEGIN NOW Deserv'd to bear this endless infamy? END
BEGIN NOW Whence am I forc'd, and whether am I borne? END
BEGIN NOW How, and with what reproach, shall I return? END
BEGIN NOW Shall ever I behold the Latian plain, END
BEGIN NOW Or see Laurentum's lofty tow'rs again? END
BEGIN NOW What will they say of their deserting chief END
BEGIN NOW The war was mine: I fly from their relief; END
BEGIN NOW I led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave; END
BEGIN NOW And ev'n from hence their dying groans receive. END
BEGIN NOW Here, overmatch'd in fight, in heaps they lie; END
BEGIN NOW There, scatter'd o'er the fields, ignobly fly. END
BEGIN NOW Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive! END
BEGIN NOW Or, O ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve! END
BEGIN NOW On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive; END
BEGIN NOW Or set me shipwrack'd on some desart shore, END
BEGIN NOW Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more, END
BEGIN NOW Unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious Fame, END
BEGIN NOW Lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Turnus rav'd, and various fates revolv'd: END
BEGIN NOW The choice was doubtful, but the death resolv'd. END
BEGIN NOW And now the sword, and now the sea took place, END
BEGIN NOW That to revenge, and this to purge disgrace. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main, END
BEGIN NOW By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain. END
BEGIN NOW Thrice he the sword assay'd, and thrice the flood; END
BEGIN NOW But Juno, mov'd with pity, both withstood. END
BEGIN NOW And thrice repress'd his rage; strong gales supplied, END
BEGIN NOW And push'd the vessel o'er the swelling tide. END
BEGIN NOW At length she lands him on his native shores, END
BEGIN NOW And to his father's longing arms restores. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime, by Jove's impulse, Mezentius arm'd, END
BEGIN NOW Succeeding Turnus, with his ardor warm'd END
BEGIN NOW His fainting friends, reproach'd their shameful flight, END
BEGIN NOW Repell'd the victors, and renew'd the fight. END
BEGIN NOW Against their king the Tuscan troops conspire; END
BEGIN NOW Such is their hate, and such their fierce desire END
BEGIN NOW Of wish'd revenge: on him, and him alone, END
BEGIN NOW All hands employ'd, and all their darts are thrown. END
BEGIN NOW He, like a solid rock by seas inclos'd, END
BEGIN NOW To raging winds and roaring waves oppos'd, END
BEGIN NOW From his proud summit looking down, disdains END
BEGIN NOW Their empty menace, and unmov'd remains. END
BEGIN NOW Beneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead, END
BEGIN NOW Then Latagus, and Palmus as he fled. END
BEGIN NOW At Latagus a weighty stone he flung: END
BEGIN NOW His face was flatted, and his helmet rung. END
BEGIN NOW But Palmus from behind receives his wound; END
BEGIN NOW Hamstring'd he falls, and grovels on the ground: END
BEGIN NOW His crest and armor, from his body torn, END
BEGIN NOW Thy shoulders, Lausus, and thy head adorn. END
BEGIN NOW Evas and Mimas, both of Troy, he slew. END
BEGIN NOW Mimas his birth from fair Theano drew, END
BEGIN NOW Born on that fatal night, when, big with fire, END
BEGIN NOW The queen produc'd young Paris to his sire: END
BEGIN NOW But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain, END
BEGIN NOW Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain. END
BEGIN NOW And, as a savage boar, on mountains bred, END
BEGIN NOW With forest mast and fatt'ning marshes fed, END
BEGIN NOW When once he sees himself in toils inclos'd, END
BEGIN NOW By huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos'd- END
BEGIN NOW He whets his tusks, and turns, and dares the war; END
BEGIN NOW Th' invaders dart their jav'lins from afar: END
BEGIN NOW All keep aloof, and safely shout around; END
BEGIN NOW But none presumes to give a nearer wound: END
BEGIN NOW He frets and froths, erects his bristled hide, END
BEGIN NOW And shakes a grove of lances from his side: END
BEGIN NOW Not otherwise the troops, with hate inspir'd, END
BEGIN NOW And just revenge against the tyrant fir'd, END
BEGIN NOW Their darts with clamor at a distance drive, END
BEGIN NOW And only keep the languish'd war alive. END
BEGIN NOW From Coritus came Acron to the fight, END
BEGIN NOW Who left his spouse betroth'd, and unconsummate night. END
BEGIN NOW Mezentius sees him thro' the squadrons ride, END
BEGIN NOW Proud of the purple favors of his bride. END
BEGIN NOW Then, as a hungry lion, who beholds END
BEGIN NOW A gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds, END
BEGIN NOW Or beamy stag, that grazes on the plain- END
BEGIN NOW He runs, he roars, he shakes his rising mane, END
BEGIN NOW He grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws; END
BEGIN NOW The prey lies panting underneath his paws: END
BEGIN NOW He fills his famish'd maw; his mouth runs o'er END
BEGIN NOW With unchew'd morsels, while he churns the gore: END
BEGIN NOW So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes, END
BEGIN NOW And first unhappy Acron overthrows: END
BEGIN NOW Stretch'd at his length, he spurns the swarthy ground; END
BEGIN NOW The lance, besmear'd with blood, lies broken in the wound. END
BEGIN NOW Then with disdain the haughty victor view'd END
BEGIN NOW Orodes flying, nor the wretch pursued, END
BEGIN NOW But, running, gain'd th' advantage of the ground: END
BEGIN NOW Then turning short, he met him face to face, END
BEGIN NOW To give his victor the better grace. END
BEGIN NOW Orodes falls, equal fight oppress'd: END
BEGIN NOW Mezentius fix'd his foot upon his breast, END
BEGIN NOW And rested lance; and thus aloud he cries: END
BEGIN NOW Lo! here the champion of my rebels lies! END
BEGIN NOW The fields around with Io Paean! ring; END
BEGIN NOW And peals of shouts applaud the conqu'ring king. END
BEGIN NOW At this the vanquish'd, with his dying breath, END
BEGIN NOW Thus faintly spoke, and prophesied in death: END
BEGIN NOW Nor thou, proud man, unpunish'd shalt remain: END
BEGIN NOW Like death attends thee on this fatal plain. END
BEGIN NOW Then, sourly smiling, thus the king replied: END
BEGIN NOW For what belongs to me, let Jove provide; END
BEGIN NOW But die thou first, whatever chance ensue. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and from the wound the weapon drew. END
BEGIN NOW A hov'ring mist came swimming o'er his sight, END
BEGIN NOW And seal'd his eyes in everlasting night. END
BEGIN NOW By Caedicus, Alcathous was slain; END
BEGIN NOW Sacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain; END
BEGIN NOW Orses the strong to greater strength must yield; END
BEGIN NOW He, with Parthenius, were by Rapo kill'd. END
BEGIN NOW Then brave Messapus Ericetes slew, END
BEGIN NOW Who from Lycaon's blood his lineage drew. END
BEGIN NOW But from his headstrong horse his fate he found, END
BEGIN NOW Who threw his master, as he made a bound: END
BEGIN NOW The chief, alighting, stuck him to the ground; END
BEGIN NOW Then Clonius, hand to hand, on foot assails: END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan sinks, and Neptune's son prevails. END
BEGIN NOW Agis the Lycian, stepping forth with pride, END
BEGIN NOW To single fight the boldest foe defied; END
BEGIN NOW Whom Tuscan Valerus by force o'ercame, END
BEGIN NOW And not belied his mighty father's fame. END
BEGIN NOW Salius to death the great Antronius sent: END
BEGIN NOW But the same fate the victor underwent, END
BEGIN NOW Slain by Nealces' hand, well-skill'd to throw END
BEGIN NOW The flying dart, and draw the far-deceiving bow. END
BEGIN NOW Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance; END
BEGIN NOW By turns they quit their ground, by turns advance: END
BEGIN NOW Victors and vanquish'd, in the various field, END
BEGIN NOW Nor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield. END
BEGIN NOW The gods from heav'n survey the fatal strife, END
BEGIN NOW And mourn the miseries of human life. END
BEGIN NOW Above the rest, two goddesses appear END
BEGIN NOW Concern'd for each: here Venus, Juno there. END
BEGIN NOW Amidst the crowd, infernal Ate shakes END
BEGIN NOW Her scourge aloft, and crest of hissing snakes. END
BEGIN NOW Once more the proud Mezentius, with disdain, END
BEGIN NOW Brandish'd his spear, and rush'd into the plain, END
BEGIN NOW Where tow'ring in the midmost rank she stood, END
BEGIN NOW Like tall Orion stalking o'er the flood. END
BEGIN NOW (When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves, END
BEGIN NOW His shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves), END
BEGIN NOW Or like a mountain ash, whose roots are spread, END
BEGIN NOW Deep fix'd in earth; in clouds he hides his head. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan prince beheld him from afar, END
BEGIN NOW And dauntless undertook the doubtful war. END
BEGIN NOW Collected in his strength, and like a rock, END
BEGIN NOW Pois'd on his base, Mezentius stood the shock. END
BEGIN NOW He stood, and, measuring first with careful eyes END
BEGIN NOW The space his spear could reach, aloud he cries: END
BEGIN NOW My strong right hand, and sword, assist my stroke! END
BEGIN NOW (Those only gods Mezentius will invoke.) END
BEGIN NOW His armor, from the Trojan pirate torn, END
BEGIN NOW By my triumphant Lausus shall be worn. END
BEGIN NOW He said; and with his utmost force he threw END
BEGIN NOW The massy spear, which, hissing as it flew, END
BEGIN NOW Reach'd the celestial shield, that stopp'd the course; END
BEGIN NOW But, glancing thence, the yet unbroken force END
BEGIN NOW Took a new bent obliquely, and betwixt END
BEGIN NOW The side and bowels fam'd Anthores fix'd. END
BEGIN NOW Anthores had from Argos travel'd far, END
BEGIN NOW Alcides' friend, and brother of the war; END
BEGIN NOW Till, tir'd with toils, fair Italy he chose, END
BEGIN NOW And in Evander's palace sought repose. END
BEGIN NOW Now, falling by another's wound, his eyes END
BEGIN NOW He cast to heav'n, on Argos thinks, and dies. END
BEGIN NOW The pious Trojan then his jav'lin sent; END
BEGIN NOW The shield gave way; thro' treble plates it went END
BEGIN NOW Of solid brass, of linen trebly roll'd, END
BEGIN NOW And three bull hides which round the buckler fold. END
BEGIN NOW All these it pass'd, resistless in the course, END
BEGIN NOW Transpierc'd his thigh, and spent its dying force. END
BEGIN NOW The gaping wound gush'd out a crimson flood. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan, glad with sight of hostile blood, END
BEGIN NOW His faunchion drew, to closer fight address'd, END
BEGIN NOW And with new force his fainting foe oppress'd. END
BEGIN NOW His father's peril Lausus view'd with grief; END
BEGIN NOW He sigh'd, he wept, he ran to his relief. END
BEGIN NOW And here, heroic youth, 't is here I must END
BEGIN NOW To thy immortal memory be just, END
BEGIN NOW And sing an act so noble and so new, END
BEGIN NOW Posterity will scarce believe 't is true. END
BEGIN NOW Pain'd with his wound, and useless for the fight, END
BEGIN NOW The father sought to save himself by flight: END
BEGIN NOW Incumber'd, slow he dragg'd the spear along, END
BEGIN NOW Which pierc'd his thigh, and in his buckler hung. END
BEGIN NOW The pious youth, resolv'd on death, below END
BEGIN NOW The lifted sword springs forth to face the foe; END
BEGIN NOW Protects his parent, and prevents the blow. END
BEGIN NOW Shouts of applause ran ringing thro' the field, END
BEGIN NOW To see the son the vanquish'd father shield. END
BEGIN NOW All, fir'd with gen'rous indignation, strive, END
BEGIN NOW And with a storm of darts to distance drive END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan chief, who, held at bay from far, END
BEGIN NOW On his Vulcanian orb sustain'd the war. END
BEGIN NOW As, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind, END
BEGIN NOW The plowman, passenger, and lab'ring hind END
BEGIN NOW For shelter to the neighb'ring covert fly, END
BEGIN NOW Or hous'd, or safe in hollow caverns lie; END
BEGIN NOW But, that o'erblown, when heav'n above 'em smiles, END
BEGIN NOW Return to travel, and renew their toils: END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas thus, o'erwhelmed on ev'ry side, END
BEGIN NOW The storm of darts, undaunted, did abide; END
BEGIN NOW And thus to Lausus loud with friendly threat'ning cried: END
BEGIN NOW Why wilt thou rush to certain death, and rage END
BEGIN NOW In rash attempts, beyond thy tender age, END
BEGIN NOW Betray'd by pious love?" Nor, thus forborne, END
BEGIN NOW The youth desists, but with insulting scorn END
BEGIN NOW Provokes the ling'ring prince, whose patience, tir'd, END
BEGIN NOW Gave place; and all his breast with fury fir'd. END
BEGIN NOW For now the Fates prepar'd their sharpen'd shears; END
BEGIN NOW And lifted high the flaming sword appears, END
BEGIN NOW Which, full descending with a frightful sway, END
BEGIN NOW Thro' shield and corslet forc'd th' impetuous way, END
BEGIN NOW And buried deep in his fair bosom lay. END
BEGIN NOW The purple streams thro' the thin armor strove, END
BEGIN NOW And drench'd th' imbroider'd coat his mother wove; END
BEGIN NOW And life at length forsook his heaving heart, END
BEGIN NOW Loth from so sweet a mansion to depart. END
BEGIN NOW But when, with blood and paleness all o'erspread, END
BEGIN NOW The pious prince beheld young Lausus dead, END
BEGIN NOW He griev'd; he wept; the sight an image brought END
BEGIN NOW Of his own filial love, a sadly pleasing thought: END
BEGIN NOW Then stretch'd his hand to hold him up, and said: END
BEGIN NOW Poor hapless youth! what praises can be paid END
BEGIN NOW To love so great, to such transcendent store END
BEGIN NOW Of early worth, and sure presage of more? END
BEGIN NOW Accept whate'er Aeneas can afford; END
BEGIN NOW Untouch'd thy arms, untaken be thy sword; END
BEGIN NOW And all that pleas'd thee living, still remain END
BEGIN NOW Inviolate, and sacred to the slain. END
BEGIN NOW Thy body on thy parents I bestow, END
BEGIN NOW To rest thy soul, at least, if shadows know, END
BEGIN NOW Or have a sense of human things below. END
BEGIN NOW There to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell: END
BEGIN NOW ''T was by the great Aeneas hand I fell.' END
BEGIN NOW With this, his distant friends he beckons near, END
BEGIN NOW Provokes their duty, and prevents their fear: END
BEGIN NOW Himself assists to lift him from the ground, END
BEGIN NOW With clotted locks, and blood that well'd from out the wound. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime, his father, now no father, stood, END
BEGIN NOW And wash'd his wounds by Tiber's yellow flood: END
BEGIN NOW Oppress'd with anguish, panting, and o'erspent, END
BEGIN NOW His fainting limbs against an oak he leant. END
BEGIN NOW A bough his brazen helmet did sustain; END
BEGIN NOW His heavier arms lay scatter'd on the plain: END
BEGIN NOW A chosen train of youth around him stand; END
BEGIN NOW His drooping head was rested on his hand: END
BEGIN NOW His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought; END
BEGIN NOW And all on Lausus ran his restless thought. END
BEGIN NOW Careful, concern'd his danger to prevent, END
BEGIN NOW He much enquir'd, and many a message sent END
BEGIN NOW To warn him from the field- alas! in vain! END
BEGIN NOW Behold, his mournful followers bear him slain! END
BEGIN NOW O'er his broad shield still gush'd the yawning wound, END
BEGIN NOW And drew a bloody trail along the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Far off he heard their cries, far off divin'd END
BEGIN NOW The dire event, with a foreboding mind. END
BEGIN NOW With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head; END
BEGIN NOW Then both his lifted hands to heav'n he spread; END
BEGIN NOW Last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said: END
BEGIN NOW What joys, alas! could this frail being give, END
BEGIN NOW That I have been so covetous to live? END
BEGIN NOW To see my son, and such a son, resign END
BEGIN NOW His life, a ransom for preserving mine! END
BEGIN NOW And am I then preserv'd, and art thou lost? END
BEGIN NOW How much too dear has that redemption cost! END
BEGIN NOW 'T is now my bitter banishment I feel: END
BEGIN NOW This is a wound too deep for time to heal. END
BEGIN NOW My guilt thy growing virtues did defame; END
BEGIN NOW My blackness blotted thy unblemish'd name. END
BEGIN NOW Chas'd from a throne, abandon'd, and exil'd END
BEGIN NOW For foul misdeeds, were punishments too mild: END
BEGIN NOW I ow'd my people these, and, from their hate, END
BEGIN NOW With less resentment could have borne my fate. END
BEGIN NOW And yet I live, and yet sustain the sight END
BEGIN NOW Of hated men, and of more hated light: END
BEGIN NOW But will not long." With that he rais'd from ground END
BEGIN NOW His fainting limbs, that stagger'd with his wound; END
BEGIN NOW Yet, with a mind resolv'd, and unappall'd END
BEGIN NOW With pains or perils, for his courser call'd END
BEGIN NOW Well-mouth'd, well-manag'd, whom himself did dress END
BEGIN NOW With daily care, and mounted with success; END
BEGIN NOW His aid in arms, his ornament in peace. END
BEGIN NOW Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke, END
BEGIN NOW The steed seem'd sensible, while thus he spoke: END
BEGIN NOW O Rhoebus, we have liv'd too long for me- END
BEGIN NOW If life and long were terms that could agree! END
BEGIN NOW This day thou either shalt bring back the head END
BEGIN NOW And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead; END
BEGIN NOW This day thou either shalt revenge my woe, END
BEGIN NOW For murther'd Lausus, on his cruel foe; END
BEGIN NOW Or, if inexorable fate deny END
BEGIN NOW Our conquest, with thy conquer'd master die: END
BEGIN NOW For, after such a lord, rest secure, END
BEGIN NOW Thou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load endure. END
BEGIN NOW He said; and straight th' officious courser kneels, END
BEGIN NOW To take his wonted weight. His hands he fills END
BEGIN NOW With pointed jav'lins; on his head he lac'd END
BEGIN NOW His glitt'ring helm, which terribly was grac'd END
BEGIN NOW With waving horsehair, nodding from afar; END
BEGIN NOW Then spurr'd his thund'ring steed amidst the war. END
BEGIN NOW Love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought, END
BEGIN NOW Despair, and secret shame, and conscious thought END
BEGIN NOW Of inborn worth, his lab'ring soul oppress'd, END
BEGIN NOW Roll'd in his eyes, and rag'd within his breast. END
BEGIN NOW Then loud he call'd Aeneas thrice by name: END
BEGIN NOW The loud repeated voice to glad Aeneas came. END
BEGIN NOW Great Jove," he said, "and the far-shooting god, END
BEGIN NOW Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good! END
BEGIN NOW He spoke no more; but hasten'd, void of fear, END
BEGIN NOW And threaten'd with his long protended spear. END
BEGIN NOW To whom Mezentius thus: "Thy vaunts are vain. END
BEGIN NOW My Lausus lies extended on the plain: END
BEGIN NOW He's lost! thy conquest is already won; END
BEGIN NOW The wretched sire is murther'd in the son. END
BEGIN NOW Nor fate I fear, but all the gods defy. END
BEGIN NOW Forbear thy threats: my bus'ness is to die; END
BEGIN NOW But first receive this parting legacy. END
BEGIN NOW He said; and straight a whirling dart he sent; END
BEGIN NOW Another after, and another went. END
BEGIN NOW Round in a spacious ring he rides the field, END
BEGIN NOW And vainly plies th' impenetrable shield. END
BEGIN NOW Thrice rode he round; and thrice Aeneas wheel'd, END
BEGIN NOW Turn'd as he turn'd: the golden orb withstood END
BEGIN NOW The strokes, and bore about an iron wood. END
BEGIN NOW Impatient of delay, and weary grown, END
BEGIN NOW Still to defend, and to defend alone, END
BEGIN NOW To wrench the darts which in his buckler light, END
BEGIN NOW Urg'd and o'er-labor'd in unequal fight; END
BEGIN NOW At length resolv'd, he throws with all his force END
BEGIN NOW Full at the temples of the warrior horse. END
BEGIN NOW Just where the stroke was aim'd, th' unerring spear END
BEGIN NOW Made way, and stood transfix'd thro' either ear. END
BEGIN NOW Seiz'd with unwonted pain, surpris'd with fright, END
BEGIN NOW The wounded steed curvets, and, rais'd upright, END
BEGIN NOW Lights on his feet before; his hoofs behind END
BEGIN NOW Spring up in air aloft, and lash the wind. END
BEGIN NOW Down comes the rider headlong from his height: END
BEGIN NOW His horse came after with unwieldy weight, END
BEGIN NOW And, flound'ring forward, pitching on his head, END
BEGIN NOW His lord's incumber'd shoulder overlaid. END
BEGIN NOW From either host, the mingled shouts and cries END
BEGIN NOW Of Trojans and Rutulians rend the skies. END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas, hast'ning, wav'd his fatal sword END
BEGIN NOW High o'er his head, with this reproachful word: END
BEGIN NOW Now; where are now thy vaunts, the fierce disdain END
BEGIN NOW Of proud Mezentius, and the lofty strain? END
BEGIN NOW Struggling, and wildly staring on the skies, END
BEGIN NOW With scarce recover'd sight he thus replies: END
BEGIN NOW Why these insulting words, this waste of breath, END
BEGIN NOW To souls undaunted, and secure of death? END
BEGIN NOW 'T is no dishonor for the brave to die, END
BEGIN NOW Nor came I here with hope victory; END
BEGIN NOW Nor ask I life, nor fought with that design: END
BEGIN NOW As I had us'd my fortune, use thou thine. END
BEGIN NOW My dying son contracted no such band; END
BEGIN NOW The gift is hateful from his murd'rer's hand. END
BEGIN NOW For this, this only favor let me sue, END
BEGIN NOW If pity can to conquer'd foes be due: END
BEGIN NOW Refuse it not; but let my body have END
BEGIN NOW The last retreat of humankind, a grave. END
BEGIN NOW Too well I know th' insulting people's hate; END
BEGIN NOW Protect me from their vengeance after fate: END
BEGIN NOW This refuge for my poor remains provide, END
BEGIN NOW And lay my much-lov'd Lausus by my side. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and to the sword his throat applied. END
BEGIN NOW The crimson stream distain'd his arms around, END
BEGIN NOW And the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the wound. END
BEGIN NOW Scarce had the rosy Morning rais'd her head END
BEGIN NOW Above the waves, and left her wat'ry bed; END
BEGIN NOW The pious chief, whom double cares attend END
BEGIN NOW For his unburied soldiers and his friend, END
BEGIN NOW Yet first to Heav'n perform'd a victor's vows: END
BEGIN NOW He bar'd an ancient oak of all her boughs; END
BEGIN NOW Then on a rising ground the trunk he plac'd, END
BEGIN NOW Which with the spoils of his dead foe he grac'd. END
BEGIN NOW The coat of arms by proud Mezentius worn, END
BEGIN NOW Now on a naked snag in triumph borne, END
BEGIN NOW Was hung on high, and glitter'd from afar, END
BEGIN NOW A trophy sacred to the God of War. END
BEGIN NOW Above his arms, fix'd on the leafless wood, END
BEGIN NOW Appear'd his plumy crest, besmear'd with blood: END
BEGIN NOW His brazen buckler on the left was seen; END
BEGIN NOW Truncheons of shiver'd lances hung between; END
BEGIN NOW And on the right was placed his corslet, bor'd; END
BEGIN NOW And to the neck was tied his unavailing sword. END
BEGIN NOW A crowd of chiefs inclose the godlike man, END
BEGIN NOW Who thus, conspicuous in the midst, began: END
BEGIN NOW Our toils, my friends, are crown'd with sure success; END
BEGIN NOW The greater part perform'd, achieve the less. END
BEGIN NOW Now follow cheerful to the trembling town; END
BEGIN NOW Press but an entrance, and presume it won. END
BEGIN NOW Fear is no more, for fierce Mezentius lies, END
BEGIN NOW As the first fruits of war, a sacrifice. END
BEGIN NOW Turnus shall fall extended on the plain, END
BEGIN NOW And, in this omen, is already slain. END
BEGIN NOW Prepar'd in arms, pursue your happy chance; END
BEGIN NOW That none unwarn'd may plead his ignorance, END
BEGIN NOW And I, at Heav'n's appointed hour, may find END
BEGIN NOW Your warlike ensigns waving in the wind. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime the rites and fun'ral pomps prepare, END
BEGIN NOW Due to your dead companions of the war: END
BEGIN NOW The last respect the living can bestow, END
BEGIN NOW To shield their shadows from contempt below. END
BEGIN NOW That conquer'd earth be theirs, for which they fought, END
BEGIN NOW And which for us with their own blood they bought; END
BEGIN NOW But first the corpse of our unhappy friend END
BEGIN NOW To the sad city of Evander send, END
BEGIN NOW Who, not inglorious, in his age's bloom, END
BEGIN NOW Was hurried hence by too severe a doom. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way, END
BEGIN NOW Where, new in death, lamented Pallas lay. END
BEGIN NOW Acoetes watch'd the corpse; whose youth deserv'd END
BEGIN NOW The father's trust; and now the son he serv'd END
BEGIN NOW With equal faith, but less auspicious care. END
BEGIN NOW Th' attendants of the slain his sorrow share. END
BEGIN NOW A troop of Trojans mix'd with these appear, END
BEGIN NOW And mourning matrons with dishevel'd hair. END
BEGIN NOW Soon as the prince appears, they raise a cry; END
BEGIN NOW All beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky. END
BEGIN NOW They rear his drooping forehead from the ground; END
BEGIN NOW But, when Aeneas view'd the grisly wound END
BEGIN NOW Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore, END
BEGIN NOW And the fair flesh distain'd with purple gore; END
BEGIN NOW First, melting into tears, the pious man END
BEGIN NOW Deplor'd so sad a sight, then thus began: END
BEGIN NOW Unhappy youth! when Fortune gave the rest END
BEGIN NOW Of my full wishes, she refus'd the best! END
BEGIN NOW She came; but brought not thee along, to bless END
BEGIN NOW My longing eyes, and share in my success: END
BEGIN NOW She grudg'd thy safe return, the triumphs due END
BEGIN NOW To prosp'rous valor, in the public view. END
BEGIN NOW Not thus I promis'd, when thy father lent END
BEGIN NOW Thy needless succor with a sad consent; END
BEGIN NOW Embrac'd me, parting for th' Etrurian land, END
BEGIN NOW And sent me to possess a large command. END
BEGIN NOW He warn'd, and from his own experience told, END
BEGIN NOW Our foes were warlike, disciplin'd, and bold. END
BEGIN NOW And now perhaps, in hopes of thy return, END
BEGIN NOW Rich odors on his loaded altars burn, END
BEGIN NOW While we, with vain officious pomp, prepare END
BEGIN NOW To send him back his portion of the war, END
BEGIN NOW A bloody breathless body, which can owe END
BEGIN NOW No farther debt, but to the pow'rs below. END
BEGIN NOW The wretched father, ere his race is run, END
BEGIN NOW Shall view the fun'ral honors of his son. END
BEGIN NOW These are my triumphs of the Latian war, END
BEGIN NOW Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care! END
BEGIN NOW And yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see END
BEGIN NOW A son whose death disgrac'd his ancestry; END
BEGIN NOW Thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev'd: END
BEGIN NOW Thy Pallas no dishonest wound receiv'd. END
BEGIN NOW He died no death to make thee wish, too late, END
BEGIN NOW Thou hadst not liv'd to see his shameful fate: END
BEGIN NOW But what a champion has th' Ausonian coast, END
BEGIN NOW And what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost! END
BEGIN NOW Thus having mourn'd, he gave the word around, END
BEGIN NOW To raise the breathless body from the ground; END
BEGIN NOW And chose a thousand horse, the flow'r of all END
BEGIN NOW His warlike troops, to wait the funeral, END
BEGIN NOW To bear him back and share Evander's grief: END
BEGIN NOW A well-becoming, but a weak relief. END
BEGIN NOW Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier, END
BEGIN NOW Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear. END
BEGIN NOW The body on this rural hearse is borne: END
BEGIN NOW Strew'd leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn. END
BEGIN NOW All pale he lies, and looks a lovely flow'r, END
BEGIN NOW New cropp'd by virgin hands, to dress the bow'r: END
BEGIN NOW Unfaded yet, but yet unfed below, END
BEGIN NOW No more to mother earth or the green stern shall owe. END
BEGIN NOW Then two fair vests, of wondrous work and cost, END
BEGIN NOW Of purple woven, and with gold emboss'd, END
BEGIN NOW For ornament the Trojan hero brought, END
BEGIN NOW Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought. END
BEGIN NOW One vest array'd the corpse; and one they spread END
BEGIN NOW O'er his clos'd eyes, and wrapp'd around his head, END
BEGIN NOW That, when the yellow hair in flame should fall, END
BEGIN NOW The catching fire might burn the golden caul. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, the spoils of foes in battle slain, END
BEGIN NOW When he descended on the Latian plain; END
BEGIN NOW Arms, trappings, horses, by the hearse are led END
BEGIN NOW In long array- th' achievements of the dead. END
BEGIN NOW Then, pinion'd with their hands behind, appear END
BEGIN NOW Th' unhappy captives, marching in the rear, END
BEGIN NOW Appointed off'rings in the victor's name, END
BEGIN NOW To sprinkle with their blood the fun'ral flame. END
BEGIN NOW Inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne; END
BEGIN NOW Gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn; END
BEGIN NOW And fair inscriptions fix'd, and titles read END
BEGIN NOW Of Latian leaders conquer'd by the dead. END
BEGIN NOW Acoetes on his pupil's corpse attends, END
BEGIN NOW With feeble steps, supported by his friends. END
BEGIN NOW Pausing at ev'ry pace, in sorrow drown'd, END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground; END
BEGIN NOW Where grov'ling while he lies in deep despair, END
BEGIN NOW He beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair. END
BEGIN NOW The champion's chariot next is seen to roll, END
BEGIN NOW Besmear'd with hostile blood, and honorably foul. END
BEGIN NOW To close the pomp, Aethon, the steed of state, END
BEGIN NOW Is led, the fun'rals of his lord to wait. END
BEGIN NOW Stripp'd of his trappings, with a sullen pace END
BEGIN NOW He walks; and the big tears run rolling down his face. END
BEGIN NOW The lance of Pallas, and the crimson crest, END
BEGIN NOW Are borne behind: the victor seiz'd the rest. END
BEGIN NOW The march begins: the trumpets hoarsely sound; END
BEGIN NOW The pikes and lances trail along the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse END
BEGIN NOW To Pallantean tow'rs direct their course, END
BEGIN NOW In long procession rank'd, the pious chief END
BEGIN NOW Stopp'd in the rear, and gave a vent to grief: END
BEGIN NOW The public care," he said, "which war attends, END
BEGIN NOW Diverts our present woes, at least suspends. END
BEGIN NOW Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell! END
BEGIN NOW Hail, holy relics! and a last farewell! END
BEGIN NOW He said no more, but, inly thro' he mourn'd, END
BEGIN NOW Restrained his tears, and to the camp return'd. END
BEGIN NOW Now suppliants, from Laurentum sent, demand END
BEGIN NOW A truce, with olive branches in their hand; END
BEGIN NOW Obtest his clemency, and from the plain END
BEGIN NOW Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain. END
BEGIN NOW They plead, that none those common rites deny END
BEGIN NOW To conquer'd foes that in fair battle die. END
BEGIN NOW All cause of hate was ended in their death; END
BEGIN NOW Nor could he war with bodies void of breath. END
BEGIN NOW A king, they hop'd, would hear a king's request, END
BEGIN NOW Whose son he once was call'd, and once his guest. END
BEGIN NOW Their suit, which was too just to be denied, END
BEGIN NOW The hero grants, and farther thus replied: END
BEGIN NOW O Latian princes, how severe a fate END
BEGIN NOW In causeless quarrels has involv'd your state, END
BEGIN NOW And arm'd against an unoffending man, END
BEGIN NOW Who sought your friendship ere the war began! END
BEGIN NOW You beg a truce, which I would gladly give, END
BEGIN NOW Not only for the slain, but those who live. END
BEGIN NOW I came not hither but by Heav'n's command, END
BEGIN NOW And sent by fate to share the Latian land. END
BEGIN NOW Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied END
BEGIN NOW My proffer'd friendship, and my promis'd bride; END
BEGIN NOW Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try END
BEGIN NOW His cause in arms, to conquer or to die. END
BEGIN NOW My right and his are in dispute: the slain END
BEGIN NOW Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain. END
BEGIN NOW In equal arms let us alone contend; END
BEGIN NOW And let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend. END
BEGIN NOW This is the way (so tell him) to possess END
BEGIN NOW The royal virgin, and restore the peace. END
BEGIN NOW Bear this message back, with ample leave, END
BEGIN NOW That your slain friends may fun'ral rites receive. END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said- th' embassadors, amaz'd, END
BEGIN NOW Stood mute a while, and on each other gaz'd. END
BEGIN NOW Drances, their chief, who harbor'd in his breast END
BEGIN NOW Long hate to Turnus, as his foe profess'd, END
BEGIN NOW Broke silence first, and to the godlike man, END
BEGIN NOW With graceful action bowing, thus began: END
BEGIN NOW Auspicious prince, in arms a mighty name, END
BEGIN NOW But yet whose actions far transcend your fame; END
BEGIN NOW Would I your justice or your force express, END
BEGIN NOW Thought can but equal; and all words are less. END
BEGIN NOW Your answer we shall thankfully relate, END
BEGIN NOW And favors granted to the Latian state. END
BEGIN NOW If wish'd success our labor shall attend, END
BEGIN NOW Think peace concluded, and the king your friend: END
BEGIN NOW Let Turnus leave the realm to your command, END
BEGIN NOW And seek alliance in some other land: END
BEGIN NOW Build you the city which your fates assign; END
BEGIN NOW We shall be proud in the great work to join. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Drances; and his words so well persuade END
BEGIN NOW The rest impower'd, that soon a truce is made. END
BEGIN NOW Twelve days the term allow'd: and, during those, END
BEGIN NOW Latians and Trojans, now no longer foes, END
BEGIN NOW Mix'd in the woods, for fun'ral piles prepare END
BEGIN NOW To fell the timber, and forget the war. END
BEGIN NOW Loud axes thro' the groaning groves resound; END
BEGIN NOW Oak, mountain ash, and poplar spread the ground; END
BEGIN NOW First fall from high; and some the trunks receive END
BEGIN NOW In loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave. END
BEGIN NOW And now the fatal news by Fame is blown END
BEGIN NOW Thro' the short circuit of th' Arcadian town, END
BEGIN NOW Of Pallas slain- by Fame, which just before END
BEGIN NOW His triumphs on distended pinions bore. END
BEGIN NOW Rushing from out the gate, the people stand, END
BEGIN NOW Each with a fun'ral flambeau in his hand. END
BEGIN NOW Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze: END
BEGIN NOW The fields are lighten'd with a fiery blaze, END
BEGIN NOW That cast a sullen splendor on their friends, END
BEGIN NOW The marching troop which their dead prince attends. END
BEGIN NOW Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry; END
BEGIN NOW The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply, END
BEGIN NOW And their mix'd mourning rends the vaulted sky. END
BEGIN NOW The town is fill'd with tumult and with tears, END
BEGIN NOW Till the loud clamors reach Evander's ears: END
BEGIN NOW Forgetful of his state, he runs along, END
BEGIN NOW With a disorder'd pace, and cleaves the throng; END
BEGIN NOW Falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies, END
BEGIN NOW With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks END
BEGIN NOW A passage, and at once he weeps and speaks: END
BEGIN NOW O Pallas! thou hast fail'd thy plighted word, END
BEGIN NOW To fight with caution, not to tempt the sword! END
BEGIN NOW I warn'd thee, but in vain; for well I knew END
BEGIN NOW What perils youthful ardor would pursue, END
BEGIN NOW That boiling blood would carry thee too far, END
BEGIN NOW Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war! END
BEGIN NOW O curst essay of arms, disastrous doom, END
BEGIN NOW Prelude of bloody fields, and fights to come! END
BEGIN NOW Hard elements of unauspicious war, END
BEGIN NOW Vain vows to Heav'n, and unavailing care! END
BEGIN NOW Thrice happy thou, dear partner of my bed, END
BEGIN NOW Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled, END
BEGIN NOW Praescious of ills, and leaving me behind, END
BEGIN NOW To drink the dregs of life by fate assign'd! END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the goal of nature I have gone: END
BEGIN NOW My Pallas late set out, but reach'd too soon. END
BEGIN NOW If, for my league against th' Ausonian state, END
BEGIN NOW Amidst their weapons I had found my fate, END
BEGIN NOW (Deserv'd from them,) then I had been return'd END
BEGIN NOW A breathless victor, and my son had mourn'd. END
BEGIN NOW Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid, END
BEGIN NOW Nor grudge th' alliance I so gladly made. END
BEGIN NOW 'T was not his fault, my Pallas fell so young, END
BEGIN NOW But my own crime, for having liv'd too long. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, since the gods had destin'd him to die, END
BEGIN NOW At least he led the way to victory: END
BEGIN NOW First for his friends he won the fatal shore, END
BEGIN NOW And sent whole herds of slaughter'd foes before; END
BEGIN NOW A death too great, too glorious to deplore. END
BEGIN NOW Nor will I add new honors to thy grave, END
BEGIN NOW Content with those the Trojan hero gave: END
BEGIN NOW That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends design'd, END
BEGIN NOW In which the Tuscan chiefs and army join'd. END
BEGIN NOW Great spoils and trophies, gain'd by thee, they bear: END
BEGIN NOW Then let thy own achievements be thy share. END
BEGIN NOW Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood, END
BEGIN NOW Whose mighty trunk had better grac'd the wood, END
BEGIN NOW If Pallas had arriv'd, with equal length END
BEGIN NOW Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength. END
BEGIN NOW But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain END
BEGIN NOW These troops, to view the tears thou shedd'st in vain? END
BEGIN NOW Go, friends, this message to your lord relate: END
BEGIN NOW Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate, END
BEGIN NOW And, after Pallas' death, live ling'ring on, END
BEGIN NOW 'T is to behold his vengeance for my son. END
BEGIN NOW I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head END
BEGIN NOW Is owing to the living and the dead. END
BEGIN NOW My son and I expect it from his hand; END
BEGIN NOW 'T is all that he can give, or we demand. END
BEGIN NOW Joy is no more; but I would gladly go, END
BEGIN NOW To greet my Pallas with such news below. END
BEGIN NOW The morn had now dispell'd the shades of night, END
BEGIN NOW Restoring toils, when she restor'd the light. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command END
BEGIN NOW To raise the piles along the winding strand. END
BEGIN NOW Their friends convey the dead fun'ral fires; END
BEGIN NOW Black smold'ring smoke from the green wood expires; END
BEGIN NOW The light of heav'n is chok'd, and the new day retires. END
BEGIN NOW Then thrice around the kindled piles they go END
BEGIN NOW (For ancient custom had ordain'd it so) END
BEGIN NOW Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led; END
BEGIN NOW And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead. END
BEGIN NOW Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground, END
BEGIN NOW And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound. END
BEGIN NOW Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw END
BEGIN NOW The spoils, in battle taken from the foe: END
BEGIN NOW Helms, bits emboss'd, and swords of shining steel; END
BEGIN NOW One casts a target, one a chariot wheel; END
BEGIN NOW Some to their fellows their own arms restore: END
BEGIN NOW The fauchions which in luckless fight they bore, END
BEGIN NOW Their bucklers pierc'd, their darts bestow'd in vain, END
BEGIN NOW And shiver'd lances gather'd from the plain. END
BEGIN NOW Whole herds of offer'd bulls, about the fire, END
BEGIN NOW And bristled boars, and woolly sheep expire. END
BEGIN NOW Around the piles a careful troop attends, END
BEGIN NOW To watch the wasting flames, and weep their burning friends; END
BEGIN NOW Ling'ring along the shore, till dewy night END
BEGIN NOW New decks the face of heav'n with starry light. END
BEGIN NOW The conquer'd Latians, with like pious care, END
BEGIN NOW Piles without number for their dead prepare. END
BEGIN NOW Part in the places where they fell are laid; END
BEGIN NOW And part are to the neighb'ring fields convey'd. END
BEGIN NOW The corps of kings, and captains of renown, END
BEGIN NOW Borne off in state, are buried in the town; END
BEGIN NOW The rest, unhonor'd, and without a name, END
BEGIN NOW Are cast a common heap to feed the flame. END
BEGIN NOW Trojans and Latians vie with like desires END
BEGIN NOW To make the field of battle shine with fires, END
BEGIN NOW And the promiscuous blaze to heav'n aspires. END
BEGIN NOW Now had the morning thrice renew'd the light, END
BEGIN NOW And thrice dispell'd the shadows of the night, END
BEGIN NOW When those who round the wasted fires remain, END
BEGIN NOW Perform the last sad office to the slain. END
BEGIN NOW They rake the yet warm ashes from below; END
BEGIN NOW These, and the bones unburn'd, in earth bestow; END
BEGIN NOW These relics with their country rites they grace, END
BEGIN NOW And raise a mount of turf to mark the place. END
BEGIN NOW But, in the palace of the king, appears END
BEGIN NOW A scene more solemn, and a pomp of tears. END
BEGIN NOW Maids, matrons, widows, mix their common moans; END
BEGIN NOW Orphans their sires, and sires lament their sons. END
BEGIN NOW All in that universal sorrow share, END
BEGIN NOW And curse the cause of this unhappy war: END
BEGIN NOW A broken league, a bride unjustly sought, END
BEGIN NOW A crown usurp'd, which with their blood is bought! END
BEGIN NOW These are the crimes with which they load the name END
BEGIN NOW Of Turnus, and on him alone exclaim: END
BEGIN NOW Let him who lords it o'er th' Ausonian land END
BEGIN NOW Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand: END
BEGIN NOW His is the gain; our lot is but to serve; END
BEGIN NOW 'T is just, the sway he seeks, he should deserve. END
BEGIN NOW This Drances aggravates; and adds, with spite: END
BEGIN NOW His foe expects, and dares him to the fight. END
BEGIN NOW Nor Turnus wants a party, to support END
BEGIN NOW His cause and credit in the Latian court. END
BEGIN NOW His former acts secure his present fame, END
BEGIN NOW And the queen shades him with her mighty name. END
BEGIN NOW While thus their factious minds with fury burn, END
BEGIN NOW The legates from th' Aetolian prince return: END
BEGIN NOW Sad news they bring, that, after all the cost END
BEGIN NOW And care employ'd, their embassy is lost; END
BEGIN NOW That Diomedes refus'd his aid in war, END
BEGIN NOW Unmov'd with presents, and as deaf to pray'r. END
BEGIN NOW Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought, END
BEGIN NOW Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought. END
BEGIN NOW Latinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late, END
BEGIN NOW A foreign son is pointed out by fate; END
BEGIN NOW And, till Aeneas shall Lavinia wed, END
BEGIN NOW The wrath of Heav'n is hov'ring o'er his head. END
BEGIN NOW The gods, he saw, espous'd the juster side, END
BEGIN NOW When late their titles in the field were tried: END
BEGIN NOW Witness the fresh laments, and fun'ral tears undried. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, full of anxious thought, he summons all END
BEGIN NOW The Latian senate to the council hall. END
BEGIN NOW The princes come, commanded by their head, END
BEGIN NOW And crowd the paths that to the palace lead. END
BEGIN NOW Supreme in pow'r, and reverenc'd for his years, END
BEGIN NOW He takes the throne, and in the midst appears. END
BEGIN NOW Majestically sad, he sits in state, END
BEGIN NOW And bids his envoys their success relate. END
BEGIN NOW When Venulus began, the murmuring sound END
BEGIN NOW Was hush'd, and sacred silence reign'd around. END
BEGIN NOW We have," said he, "perform'd your high command, END
BEGIN NOW And pass'd with peril a long tract of land: END
BEGIN NOW We reach'd the place desir'd; with wonder fill'd, END
BEGIN NOW The Grecian tents and rising tow'rs beheld. END
BEGIN NOW Great Diomede has compass'd round with walls END
BEGIN NOW The city, which Argyripa he calls, END
BEGIN NOW From his own Argos nam'd. We touch'd, with joy, END
BEGIN NOW The royal hand that raz'd unhappy Troy. END
BEGIN NOW When introduc'd, our presents first we bring, END
BEGIN NOW Then crave an instant audience from the king. END
BEGIN NOW His leave obtain'd, our native soil we name, END
BEGIN NOW And tell th' important cause for which we came. END
BEGIN NOW Attentively he heard us, while we spoke; END
BEGIN NOW Then, with soft accents, and a pleasing look, END
BEGIN NOW Made this return: 'Ausonian race, of old END
BEGIN NOW Renown'd for peace, and for an age of gold, END
BEGIN NOW What madness has your alter'd minds possess'd, END
BEGIN NOW To change for war hereditary rest, END
BEGIN NOW Solicit arms unknown, and tempt the sword, END
BEGIN NOW A needless ill your ancestors abhorr'd? END
BEGIN NOW We- for myself I speak, and all the name END
BEGIN NOW Of Grecians, who to Troy's destruction came, END
BEGIN NOW Omitting those who were in battle slain, END
BEGIN NOW Or borne by rolling Simois to the main- END
BEGIN NOW Not one but suffer'd, and too dearly bought END
BEGIN NOW The prize of honor which in arms he sought; END
BEGIN NOW Some doom'd to death, and some in exile driv'n. END
BEGIN NOW Outcasts, abandon'd by the care of Heav'n; END
BEGIN NOW So worn, so wretched, so despis'd a crew, END
BEGIN NOW As ev'n old Priam might with pity view. END
BEGIN NOW Witness the vessels by Minerva toss'd END
BEGIN NOW In storms; the vengeful Capharean coast; END
BEGIN NOW Th' Euboean rocks! the prince, whose brother led END
BEGIN NOW Our armies to revenge his injur'd bed, END
BEGIN NOW Have seen Charybdis and the Cyclops' den. END
BEGIN NOW Why should I name Idomeneus, in vain END
BEGIN NOW Restor'd to scepters, and expell'd again? END
BEGIN NOW Or young Achilles, by his rival slain? END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n he, the King of Men, the foremost name END
BEGIN NOW Of all the Greeks, and most renown'd by fame, END
BEGIN NOW The proud revenger of another's wife, END
BEGIN NOW Yet by his own adult'ress lost his life; END
BEGIN NOW Fell at his threshold; and the spoils of Troy END
BEGIN NOW The foul polluters of his bed enjoy. END
BEGIN NOW The gods have envied me the sweets of life, END
BEGIN NOW My much lov'd country, and my more lov'd wife: END
BEGIN NOW Banish'd from both, I mourn; while in the sky, END
BEGIN NOW Transform'd to birds, my lost companions fly: END
BEGIN NOW Hov'ring about the coasts, they make their moan, END
BEGIN NOW And cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own. END
BEGIN NOW What squalid specters, in the dead of night, END
BEGIN NOW Break my short sleep, and skim before my sight! END
BEGIN NOW I might have promis'd to myself those harms, END
BEGIN NOW Mad as I was, when I, with mortal arms, END
BEGIN NOW Presum'd against immortal pow'rs to move, END
BEGIN NOW And violate with wounds the Queen of Love. END
BEGIN NOW Such arms this hand shall never more employ; END
BEGIN NOW No hate remains with me to ruin'd Troy. END
BEGIN NOW I war not with its dust; nor am I glad END
BEGIN NOW To think of past events, or good or bad. END
BEGIN NOW Your presents I return: whate'er you bring END
BEGIN NOW To buy my friendship, send the Trojan king. END
BEGIN NOW We met in fight; I know him, to my cost: END
BEGIN NOW With what a whirling force his lance he toss'd! END
BEGIN NOW Heav'ns! what a spring was in his arm, to throw! END
BEGIN NOW How high he held his shield, and rose at ev'ry blow! END
BEGIN NOW Had Troy produc'd two more his match in might, END
BEGIN NOW They would have chang'd the fortune of the fight: END
BEGIN NOW Th' invasion of the Greeks had been return'd, END
BEGIN NOW Our empire wasted, and our cities burn'd. END
BEGIN NOW The long defense the Trojan people made, END
BEGIN NOW The war protracted, and the siege delay'd, END
BEGIN NOW Were due to Hector's and this hero's hand: END
BEGIN NOW Both brave alike, and equal in command; END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas, not inferior in the field, END
BEGIN NOW In pious reverence to the gods excell'd. END
BEGIN NOW Make peace, ye Latians, and avoid with care END
BEGIN NOW Th' impending dangers of a fatal war.' END
BEGIN NOW He said no more; but, with this cold excuse, END
BEGIN NOW Refus'd th' alliance, and advis'd a truce. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Venulus concluded his report. END
BEGIN NOW A jarring murmur fill'd the factious court: END
BEGIN NOW As, when a torrent rolls with rapid force, END
BEGIN NOW And dashes o'er the stones that stop the course, END
BEGIN NOW The flood, constrain'd within a scanty space, END
BEGIN NOW Roars horrible along th' uneasy race; END
BEGIN NOW White foam in gath'ring eddies floats around; END
BEGIN NOW The rocky shores rebellow to the sound. END
BEGIN NOW The murmur ceas'd: then from his lofty throne END
BEGIN NOW The king invok'd the gods, and thus begun: END
BEGIN NOW I wish, ye Latins, what we now debate END
BEGIN NOW Had been resolv'd before it was too late. END
BEGIN NOW Much better had it been for you and me, END
BEGIN NOW Unforc'd by this our last necessity, END
BEGIN NOW To have been earlier wise, than now to call END
BEGIN NOW A council, when the foe surrounds the wall. END
BEGIN NOW O citizens, we wage unequal war, END
BEGIN NOW With men not only Heav'n's peculiar care, END
BEGIN NOW But Heav'n's own race; unconquer'd in the field, END
BEGIN NOW Or, conquer'd, yet unknowing how to yield. END
BEGIN NOW What hopes you had in Diomedes, lay down: END
BEGIN NOW Our hopes must center on ourselves alone. END
BEGIN NOW Yet those how feeble, and, indeed, how vain, END
BEGIN NOW You see too well; nor need my words explain. END
BEGIN NOW Vanquish'd without resource; laid flat by fate; END
BEGIN NOW Factions within, a foe without the gate! END
BEGIN NOW Not but I grant that all perform'd their parts END
BEGIN NOW With manly force, and with undaunted hearts: END
BEGIN NOW With our united strength the war we wag'd; END
BEGIN NOW With equal numbers, equal arms, engag'd. END
BEGIN NOW You see th' event.- Now hear what I propose, END
BEGIN NOW To save our friends, and satisfy our foes. END
BEGIN NOW A tract of land the Latins have possess'd END
BEGIN NOW Along the Tiber, stretching to the west, END
BEGIN NOW Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till, END
BEGIN NOW And their mix'd cattle graze the fruitful hill. END
BEGIN NOW Those mountains fill'd with firs, that lower land, END
BEGIN NOW If you consent, the Trojan shall command, END
BEGIN NOW Call'd into part of what is ours; and there, END
BEGIN NOW On terms agreed, the common country share. END
BEGIN NOW There let'em build and settle, if they please; END
BEGIN NOW Unless they choose once more to cross the seas, END
BEGIN NOW In search of seats remote from Italy, END
BEGIN NOW And from unwelcome inmates set us free. END
BEGIN NOW Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed, END
BEGIN NOW Or twice as many more, if more they need. END
BEGIN NOW Materials are at hand; a well-grown wood END
BEGIN NOW Runs equal with the margin of the flood: END
BEGIN NOW Let them the number and the form assign; END
BEGIN NOW The care and cost of all the stores be mine. END
BEGIN NOW To treat the peace, a hundred senators END
BEGIN NOW Shall be commission'd hence with ample pow'rs, END
BEGIN NOW With olive the presents they shall bear, END
BEGIN NOW A purple robe, a royal iv'ry chair, END
BEGIN NOW And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear, END
BEGIN NOW And sums of gold. Among yourselves debate END
BEGIN NOW This great affair, and save the sinking state. END
BEGIN NOW Then Drances took the word, who grudg'd, long since, END
BEGIN NOW The rising glories of the Daunian prince. END
BEGIN NOW Factious and rich, bold at the council board, END
BEGIN NOW But cautious in the field, he shunn'd the sword; END
BEGIN NOW A close caballer, and tongue-valiant lord. END
BEGIN NOW Noble his mother was, and near the throne; END
BEGIN NOW But, what his father's parentage, unknown. END
BEGIN NOW He rose, and took th' advantage of the times, END
BEGIN NOW To load young Turnus with invidious crimes. END
BEGIN NOW Such truths, O king," said he, "your words contain, END
BEGIN NOW As strike the sense, and all replies are vain; END
BEGIN NOW Nor are your loyal subjects now to seek END
BEGIN NOW What common needs require, but fear to speak. END
BEGIN NOW Let him give leave of speech, that haughty man, END
BEGIN NOW Whose pride this unauspicious war began; END
BEGIN NOW For whose ambition (let me dare to say, END
BEGIN NOW Fear set apart, tho' death is in my way) END
BEGIN NOW The plains of Latium run with blood around. END
BEGIN NOW So many valiant heroes bite the ground; END
BEGIN NOW Dejected grief in ev'ry face appears; END
BEGIN NOW A town in mourning, and a land in tears; END
BEGIN NOW While he, th' undoubted author of our harms, END
BEGIN NOW The man who menaces the gods with arms, END
BEGIN NOW Yet, after all his boasts, forsook the fight, END
BEGIN NOW And sought his safety in ignoble flight. END
BEGIN NOW Now, best of kings, since you propose to send END
BEGIN NOW Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend; END
BEGIN NOW Add yet a greater at our joint request, END
BEGIN NOW One which he values more than all the rest: END
BEGIN NOW Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride; END
BEGIN NOW With that alliance let the league be tied, END
BEGIN NOW And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide. END
BEGIN NOW Let insolence no longer awe the throne; END
BEGIN NOW But, with a father's right, bestow your own. END
BEGIN NOW For this maligner of the general good, END
BEGIN NOW If still we fear his force, he must be woo'd; END
BEGIN NOW His haughty godhead we with pray'rs implore, END
BEGIN NOW Your scepter to release, and our just rights restore. END
BEGIN NOW O cursed cause of all our ills, must we END
BEGIN NOW Wage wars unjust, and fall in fight, for thee! END
BEGIN NOW What right hast thou to rule the Latian state, END
BEGIN NOW And send us out to meet our certain fate? END
BEGIN NOW 'T is a destructive war: from Turnus' hand END
BEGIN NOW Our peace and public safety we demand. END
BEGIN NOW Let the fair bride to the brave chief remain; END
BEGIN NOW If not, the peace, without the pledge, is vain. END
BEGIN NOW Turnus, I know you think me not your friend, END
BEGIN NOW Nor will I much with your belief contend: END
BEGIN NOW I beg your greatness not to give the law END
BEGIN NOW In others' realms, but, beaten, to withdraw. END
BEGIN NOW Pity your own, or pity our estate; END
BEGIN NOW Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate. END
BEGIN NOW Your interest is, the war should never cease; END
BEGIN NOW But we have felt enough to wish the peace: END
BEGIN NOW A land exhausted to the last remains, END
BEGIN NOW Depopulated towns, and driven plains. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, if desire of fame, and thirst of pow'r, END
BEGIN NOW A beauteous princess, with a crown in dow'r, END
BEGIN NOW So fire your mind, in arms assert your right, END
BEGIN NOW And meet your foe, who dares you to the fight. END
BEGIN NOW Mankind, it seems, is made for you alone; END
BEGIN NOW We, but the slaves who mount you to the throne: END
BEGIN NOW A base ignoble crowd, without a name, END
BEGIN NOW Unwept, unworthy, of the fun'ral flame, END
BEGIN NOW By duty bound to forfeit each his life, END
BEGIN NOW That Turnus may possess a royal wife. END
BEGIN NOW Permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew END
BEGIN NOW Should share such triumphs, and detain from you END
BEGIN NOW The post of honor, your undoubted due. END
BEGIN NOW Rather alone your matchless force employ, END
BEGIN NOW To merit what alone you must enjoy. END
BEGIN NOW These words, so full of malice mix'd with art, END
BEGIN NOW Inflam'd with rage the youthful hero's heart. END
BEGIN NOW Then, groaning from the bottom of his breast, END
BEGIN NOW He heav'd for wind, and thus his wrath express'd: END
BEGIN NOW You, Drances, never want a stream of words, END
BEGIN NOW Then, when the public need requires our swords. END
BEGIN NOW First in the council hall to steer the state, END
BEGIN NOW And ever foremost in a tongue-debate, END
BEGIN NOW While our strong walls secure us from the foe, END
BEGIN NOW Ere yet with blood our ditches overflow: END
BEGIN NOW But let the potent orator declaim, END
BEGIN NOW And with the brand of coward blot my name; END
BEGIN NOW Free leave is giv'n him, when his fatal hand END
BEGIN NOW Has cover'd with more corps the sanguine strand, END
BEGIN NOW And high as mine his tow'ring trophies stand. END
BEGIN NOW If any doubt remains, who dares the most, END
BEGIN NOW Let us decide it at the Trojan's cost, END
BEGIN NOW And issue both abreast, where honor calls- END
BEGIN NOW Foes are not far to seek without the walls- END
BEGIN NOW Unless his noisy tongue can only fight, END
BEGIN NOW And feet were giv'n him but to speed his flight. END
BEGIN NOW I beaten from the field? I forc'd away? END
BEGIN NOW Had he but ev'n beheld the fight, his eyes END
BEGIN NOW Had witness'd for me what his tongue denies: END
BEGIN NOW What heaps of Trojans by this hand were slain, END
BEGIN NOW And how the bloody Tiber swell'd the main. END
BEGIN NOW All saw, but he, th' Arcadian troops retire END
BEGIN NOW In scatter'd squadrons, and their prince expire. END
BEGIN NOW The giant brothers, in their camp, have found, END
BEGIN NOW I was not forc'd with ease to quit my ground. END
BEGIN NOW Not such the Trojans tried me, when, inclos'd, END
BEGIN NOW I singly their united arms oppos'd: END
BEGIN NOW First forc'd an entrance thro' their thick array; END
BEGIN NOW Then, glutted with their slaughter, freed my way. END
BEGIN NOW 'T is a destructive war? So let it be, END
BEGIN NOW But to the Phrygian pirate, and to thee! END
BEGIN NOW Meantime proceed to fill the people's ears END
BEGIN NOW With false reports, their minds with panic fears: END
BEGIN NOW Extol the strength of a twice-conquer'd race; END
BEGIN NOW Our foes encourage, and our friends debase. END
BEGIN NOW Believe thy fables, and the Trojan town END
BEGIN NOW Triumphant stands; the Grecians are o'erthrown; END
BEGIN NOW Suppliant at Hector's feet Achilles lies, END
BEGIN NOW And Diomede from fierce Aeneas flies. END
BEGIN NOW Say rapid Aufidus with awful dread END
BEGIN NOW Runs backward from the sea, and hides his head, END
BEGIN NOW When the great Trojan on his bank appears; END
BEGIN NOW For that's as true as thy dissembled fears END
BEGIN NOW Of my revenge. Dismiss that vanity: END
BEGIN NOW Thou, Drances, art below a death from me. END
BEGIN NOW Let that vile soul in that vile body rest; END
BEGIN NOW The lodging is well worthy of the guest. END
BEGIN NOW Now, royal father, to the present state END
BEGIN NOW Of our affairs, and of this high debate: END
BEGIN NOW If in your arms thus early you diffide, END
BEGIN NOW And think your fortune is already tried; END
BEGIN NOW If one defeat has brought us down so low, END
BEGIN NOW As never more in fields to meet the foe; END
BEGIN NOW Then I conclude for peace: 't is time to treat, END
BEGIN NOW And lie like vassals at the victor's feet. END
BEGIN NOW But, O! if any ancient blood remains, END
BEGIN NOW One drop of all our fathers', in our veins, END
BEGIN NOW That man would I prefer before the rest, END
BEGIN NOW Who dar'd his death with an undaunted breast; END
BEGIN NOW Who comely fell, by no dishonest wound, END
BEGIN NOW To shun that sight, and, dying, gnaw'd the ground. END
BEGIN NOW But, if we still have fresh recruits in store, END
BEGIN NOW If our confederates can afford us more; END
BEGIN NOW If the contended field we bravely fought, END
BEGIN NOW And not a bloodless victory was bought; END
BEGIN NOW Their losses equal'd ours; and, for their slain, END
BEGIN NOW With equal fires they fill'd the shining plain; END
BEGIN NOW Why thus, unforc'd, should we so tamely yield, END
BEGIN NOW And, ere the trumpet sounds, resign the field? END
BEGIN NOW Good unexpected, evils unforeseen, END
BEGIN NOW Appear by turns, as fortune shifts the scene: END
BEGIN NOW Some, rais'd aloft, come tumbling down amain; END
BEGIN NOW Then fall so hard, they bound and rise again. END
BEGIN NOW If Diomede refuse his aid to lend, END
BEGIN NOW The great Messapus yet remains our friend: END
BEGIN NOW Tolumnius, who foretells events, is ours; END
BEGIN NOW Th' Italian chiefs and princes join their pow'rs: END
BEGIN NOW Nor least in number, nor in name the last, END
BEGIN NOW Your own brave subjects have your cause embrac'd END
BEGIN NOW Above the rest, the Volscian Amazon END
BEGIN NOW Contains an army in herself alone, END
BEGIN NOW And heads a squadron, terrible to sight, END
BEGIN NOW With glitt'ring shields, in brazen armor bright. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, if the foe a single fight demand, END
BEGIN NOW And I alone the public peace withstand; END
BEGIN NOW If you consent, he shall not be refus'd, END
BEGIN NOW Nor find a hand to victory unus'd. END
BEGIN NOW This new Achilles, let him take the field, END
BEGIN NOW With fated armor, and Vulcanian shield! END
BEGIN NOW For you, my royal father, and my fame, END
BEGIN NOW I, Turnus, not the least of all my name, END
BEGIN NOW Devote my soul. He calls me hand to hand, END
BEGIN NOW And I alone will answer his demand. END
BEGIN NOW Drances shall rest secure, and neither share END
BEGIN NOW The danger, nor divide the prize of war. END
BEGIN NOW While they debate, nor these nor those will yield, END
BEGIN NOW Aeneas draws his forces to the field, END
BEGIN NOW And moves his camp. The scouts with flying speed END
BEGIN NOW Return, and thro' the frighted city spread END
BEGIN NOW Th' unpleasing news, the Trojans are descried, END
BEGIN NOW In battle marching by the river side, END
BEGIN NOW And bending to the town. They take th' alarm: END
BEGIN NOW Some tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm. END
BEGIN NOW Th' impetuous youth press forward to the field; END
BEGIN NOW They clash the sword, and clatter on the shield: END
BEGIN NOW The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry; END
BEGIN NOW Old feeble men with fainter groans reply; END
BEGIN NOW A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky, END
BEGIN NOW Like that of swans remurm'ring to the floods, END
BEGIN NOW Or birds of diff'ring kinds in hollow woods. END
BEGIN NOW Turnus th' occasion takes, and cries aloud: END
BEGIN NOW Talk on, ye quaint haranguers of the crowd: END
BEGIN NOW Declaim in praise of peace, when danger calls, END
BEGIN NOW And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and, turning short, with speedy pace, END
BEGIN NOW Casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place: END
BEGIN NOW Thou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command END
BEGIN NOW To mount; and lead thyself our Ardean band. END
BEGIN NOW Messapus and Catillus, post your force END
BEGIN NOW Along the fields, to charge the Trojan horse. END
BEGIN NOW Some guard the passes, others man the wall; END
BEGIN NOW Drawn up in arms, the rest attend my call. END
BEGIN NOW They swarm from ev'ry quarter of the town, END
BEGIN NOW And with disorder'd haste the rampires crown. END
BEGIN NOW Good old Latinus, when he saw, too late, END
BEGIN NOW The gath'ring storm just breaking on the state, END
BEGIN NOW Dismiss'd the council till a fitter time, END
BEGIN NOW And own'd his easy temper as his crime, END
BEGIN NOW Who, forc'd against his reason, had complied END
BEGIN NOW To break the treaty for the promis'd bride. END
BEGIN NOW Some help to sink new trenches; others aid END
BEGIN NOW To ram the stones, or raise the palisade. END
BEGIN NOW Hoarse trumpets sound th' alarm; around the walls END
BEGIN NOW Runs a distracted crew, whom their last labor calls. END
BEGIN NOW A sad procession in the streets is seen, END
BEGIN NOW Of matrons, that attend the mother queen: END
BEGIN NOW High in her chair she sits, and, at her side, END
BEGIN NOW With downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride. END
BEGIN NOW They mount the cliff, where Pallas' temple stands; END
BEGIN NOW Pray'rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands, END
BEGIN NOW With censers first they fume the sacred shrine, END
BEGIN NOW Then in this common supplication join: END
BEGIN NOW O patroness of arms, unspotted maid, END
BEGIN NOW Propitious hear, and lend thy Latins aid! END
BEGIN NOW Break short the pirate's lance; pronounce his fate, END
BEGIN NOW And lay the Phrygian low before the gate. END
BEGIN NOW Now Turnus arms for fight. His back and breast END
BEGIN NOW Well-temper'd steel and scaly brass invest: END
BEGIN NOW The cuishes which his brawny thighs infold END
BEGIN NOW Are mingled metal damask'd o'er with gold. END
BEGIN NOW His faithful fauchion sits upon his side; END
BEGIN NOW Nor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide: END
BEGIN NOW But, bare to view, amid surrounding friends, END
BEGIN NOW With godlike grace, he from the tow'r descends. END
BEGIN NOW Exulting in his strength, he seems to dare END
BEGIN NOW His absent rival, and to promise war. END
BEGIN NOW Freed from his keepers, thus, with broken reins, END
BEGIN NOW The wanton courser prances o'er the plains, END
BEGIN NOW Or in the pride of youth o'erleaps the mounds, END
BEGIN NOW And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds. END
BEGIN NOW Or seeks his wat'ring in the well-known flood, END
BEGIN NOW To quench his thirst, and cool his fiery blood: END
BEGIN NOW He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain, END
BEGIN NOW And o'er his shoulder flows his waving mane: END
BEGIN NOW He neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on high; END
BEGIN NOW Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly. END
BEGIN NOW Soon as the prince appears without the gate, END
BEGIN NOW The Volscians, with their virgin leader, wait END
BEGIN NOW His last commands. Then, with a graceful mien, END
BEGIN NOW Lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen: END
BEGIN NOW Her squadron imitates, and each descends; END
BEGIN NOW Whose common suit Camilla thus commends: END
BEGIN NOW If sense of honor, if a soul secure END
BEGIN NOW Of inborn worth, that can all tests endure, END
BEGIN NOW Can promise aught, or on itself rely END
BEGIN NOW Greatly to dare, to conquer or to die; END
BEGIN NOW Then, I alone, sustain'd by these, will meet END
BEGIN NOW The Tyrrhene troops, and promise their defeat. END
BEGIN NOW Ours be the danger, ours the sole renown: END
BEGIN NOW You, gen'ral, stay behind, and guard the town: END
BEGIN NOW Turnus a while stood mute, with glad surprise, END
BEGIN NOW And on the fierce virago fix'd his eyes; END
BEGIN NOW Then thus return'd: "O grace of Italy, END
BEGIN NOW With what becoming thanks can I reply? END
BEGIN NOW Not only words lie lab'ring in my breast, END
BEGIN NOW But thought itself is by thy praise oppress'd. END
BEGIN NOW Yet rob me not of all; but let me join END
BEGIN NOW My toils, my hazard, and my fame, with thine. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan, not in stratagem unskill'd, END
BEGIN NOW Sends his light horse before to scour the field: END
BEGIN NOW Himself, thro' steep ascents and thorny brakes, END
BEGIN NOW A larger compass to the city takes. END
BEGIN NOW This news my scouts confirm, and I prepare END
BEGIN NOW To foil his cunning, and his force to dare; END
BEGIN NOW With chosen foot his passage to forelay, END
BEGIN NOW And place an ambush in the winding way. END
BEGIN NOW Thou, with thy Volscians, face the Tuscan horse; END
BEGIN NOW The brave Messapus shall thy troops inforce END
BEGIN NOW With those of Tibur, and the Latian band, END
BEGIN NOW Subjected all to thy supreme command. END
BEGIN NOW This said, he warns Messapus to the war, END
BEGIN NOW Then ev'ry chief exhorts with equal care. END
BEGIN NOW All thus encourag'd, his own troops he joins, END
BEGIN NOW And hastes to prosecute his deep designs. END
BEGIN NOW Inclos'd with hills, a winding valley lies, END
BEGIN NOW By nature form'd for fraud, and fitted for surprise. END
BEGIN NOW A narrow track, by human steps untrode, END
BEGIN NOW Leads, thro' perplexing thorns, to this obscure abode. END
BEGIN NOW High o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands, END
BEGIN NOW Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands. END
BEGIN NOW The top is level, an offensive seat END
BEGIN NOW Of war; and from the war a safe retreat: END
BEGIN NOW For, on the right and left, is room to press END
BEGIN NOW The foes at hand, or from afar distress; END
BEGIN NOW To drive 'em headlong downward, and to pour END
BEGIN NOW On their descending backs a stony show'r. END
BEGIN NOW Thither young Turnus took the well-known way, END
BEGIN NOW Possess'd the pass, and in blind ambush lay. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime Latonian Phoebe, from the skies, END
BEGIN NOW Beheld th' approaching war with hateful eyes, END
BEGIN NOW And call'd the light-foot Opis to her aid, END
BEGIN NOW Her most belov'd and ever-trusty maid; END
BEGIN NOW Then with a sigh began: "Camilla goes END
BEGIN NOW To meet her death amidst her fatal foes: END
BEGIN NOW The nymphs I lov'd of all my mortal train, END
BEGIN NOW Invested with Diana's arms, in vain. END
BEGIN NOW Nor is my kindness for the virgin new: END
BEGIN NOW 'T was born with her; and with her years it grew. END
BEGIN NOW Her father Metabus, when forc'd away END
BEGIN NOW From old Privernum, for tyrannic sway, END
BEGIN NOW Snatch'd up, and sav'd from his prevailing foes, END
BEGIN NOW This tender babe, companion of his woes. END
BEGIN NOW Casmilla was her mother; but he drown'd END
BEGIN NOW One hissing letter in a softer sound, END
BEGIN NOW And call'd Camilla. Thro' the woods he flies; END
BEGIN NOW Wrapp'd in his robe the royal infant lies. END
BEGIN NOW His foes in sight, he mends his weary pace; END
BEGIN NOW With shout and clamors they pursue the chase. END
BEGIN NOW The banks of Amasene at length he gains: END
BEGIN NOW The raging flood his farther flight restrains, END
BEGIN NOW Rais'd o'er the borders with unusual rains. END
BEGIN NOW Prepar'd to plunge into the stream, he fears, END
BEGIN NOW Not for himself, but for the charge he bears. END
BEGIN NOW Anxious, he stops a while, and thinks in haste; END
BEGIN NOW Then, desp'rate in distress, resolves at last. END
BEGIN NOW A knotty lance of well-boil'd oak he bore; END
BEGIN NOW The middle part with cork he cover'd o'er: END
BEGIN NOW He clos'd the child within the hollow space; END
BEGIN NOW With twigs of bending osier bound the case; END
BEGIN NOW Then pois'd the spear, heavy with human weight, END
BEGIN NOW And thus invok'd my favor for the freight: END
BEGIN NOW 'Accept, great goddess of the woods,' he said, END
BEGIN NOW 'Sent by her sire, this dedicated maid! END
BEGIN NOW Thro' air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine; END
BEGIN NOW And the first weapons that she knows, are thine.' END
BEGIN NOW He said; and with full force the spear he threw: END
BEGIN NOW Above the sounding waves Camilla flew. END
BEGIN NOW Then, press'd by foes, he stemm'd the stormy tide, END
BEGIN NOW And gain'd, by stress of arms, the farther side. END
BEGIN NOW His fasten'd spear he pull'd from out the ground, END
BEGIN NOW And, victor of his vows, his infant nymph unbound; END
BEGIN NOW Nor, after that, in towns which walls inclose, END
BEGIN NOW Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes; END
BEGIN NOW But, rough, in open air he chose to lie; END
BEGIN NOW Earth was his couch, his cov'ring was the sky. END
BEGIN NOW On hills unshorn, or in a desart den, END
BEGIN NOW He shunn'd the dire society of men. END
BEGIN NOW A shepherd's solitary life he led; END
BEGIN NOW His daughter with the milk of mares he fed. END
BEGIN NOW The dugs of bears, and ev'ry salvage beast, END
BEGIN NOW He drew, and thro' her lips the liquor press'd. END
BEGIN NOW The little Amazon could scarcely go: END
BEGIN NOW He loads her with a quiver and a bow; END
BEGIN NOW And, that she might her stagg'ring steps command, END
BEGIN NOW He with a slender jav'lin fills her hand. END
BEGIN NOW Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound; END
BEGIN NOW Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground. END
BEGIN NOW Instead of these, a tiger's hide o'erspread END
BEGIN NOW Her back and shoulders, fasten'd to her head. END
BEGIN NOW The flying dart she first attempts to fling, END
BEGIN NOW And round her tender temples toss'd the sling; END
BEGIN NOW Then, as her strength with years increas'd, began END
BEGIN NOW To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan, END
BEGIN NOW And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane. END
BEGIN NOW The Tuscan matrons with each other vied, END
BEGIN NOW To bless their rival sons with such a bride; END
BEGIN NOW But she disdains their love, to share with me END
BEGIN NOW The sylvan shades and vow'd virginity. END
BEGIN NOW And, O! I wish, contented with my cares END
BEGIN NOW Of salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars! END
BEGIN NOW Then had she been of my celestial train, END
BEGIN NOW And shunn'd the fate that dooms her to be slain. END
BEGIN NOW But since, opposing Heav'n's decree, she goes END
BEGIN NOW To find her death among forbidden foes, END
BEGIN NOW Haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight. END
BEGIN NOW Where, with the gods, averse, the Latins fight. END
BEGIN NOW This bow to thee, this quiver I bequeath, END
BEGIN NOW This chosen arrow, to revenge her death: END
BEGIN NOW By whate'er hand Camilla shall be slain, END
BEGIN NOW Or of the Trojan or Italian train, END
BEGIN NOW Let him not pass unpunish'd from the plain. END
BEGIN NOW Then, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid END
BEGIN NOW To bear the breathless body of my maid: END
BEGIN NOW Unspoil'd shall be her arms, and unprofan'd END
BEGIN NOW Her holy limbs with any human hand, END
BEGIN NOW And in a marble tomb laid in her native land. END
BEGIN NOW She said. The faithful nymph descends from high END
BEGIN NOW With rapid flight, and cuts the sounding sky: END
BEGIN NOW Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly. END
BEGIN NOW By this, the Trojan and the Tuscan horse, END
BEGIN NOW Drawn up in squadrons, with united force, END
BEGIN NOW Approach the walls: the sprightly coursers bound, END
BEGIN NOW Press forward on their bits, and shift their ground. END
BEGIN NOW Shields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far; END
BEGIN NOW And the fields glitter with a waving war. END
BEGIN NOW Oppos'd to these, come on with furious force END
BEGIN NOW Messapus, Coras, and the Latian horse; END
BEGIN NOW These in the body plac'd, on either hand END
BEGIN NOW Sustain'd and clos'd by fair Camilla's band. END
BEGIN NOW Advancing in a line, they couch their spears; END
BEGIN NOW And less and less the middle space appears. END
BEGIN NOW Thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen END
BEGIN NOW The neighing coursers, and the shouting men. END
BEGIN NOW In distance of their darts they stop their course; END
BEGIN NOW Then man to man they rush, and horse to horse. END
BEGIN NOW The face of heav'n their flying jav'lins hide, END
BEGIN NOW And deaths unseen are dealt on either side. END
BEGIN NOW Tyrrhenus, and Aconteus, void of fear, END
BEGIN NOW By mettled coursers borne in full career, END
BEGIN NOW Meet first oppos'd; and, with a mighty shock, END
BEGIN NOW Their horses' heads against each other knock. END
BEGIN NOW Far from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast, END
BEGIN NOW As with an engine's force, or lightning's blast: END
BEGIN NOW He rolls along in blood, and breathes his last. END
BEGIN NOW The Latin squadrons take a sudden fright, END
BEGIN NOW And sling their shields behind, to save their backs in flight END
BEGIN NOW Spurring at speed to their own walls they drew; END
BEGIN NOW Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue, END
BEGIN NOW And urge their flight: Asylas leads the chase; END
BEGIN NOW Till, seiz'd, with shame, they wheel about and face, END
BEGIN NOW Receive their foes, and raise a threat'ning cry. END
BEGIN NOW The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly. END
BEGIN NOW So swelling surges, with a thund'ring roar, END
BEGIN NOW Driv'n on each other's backs, insult the shore, END
BEGIN NOW Bound o'er the rocks, incroach upon the land, END
BEGIN NOW And far upon the beach eject the sand; END
BEGIN NOW Then backward, with a swing, they take their way, END
BEGIN NOW Repuls'd from upper ground, and seek their mother sea; END
BEGIN NOW With equal hurry quit th' invaded shore, END
BEGIN NOW And swallow back the sand and stones they spew'd before. END
BEGIN NOW Twice were the Tuscans masters of the field, END
BEGIN NOW Twice by the Latins, in their turn, repell'd. END
BEGIN NOW Asham'd at length, to the third charge they ran; END
BEGIN NOW Both hosts resolv'd, and mingled man to man. END
BEGIN NOW Now dying groans are heard; the fields are strow'd END
BEGIN NOW With falling bodies, and are drunk with blood. END
BEGIN NOW Arms, horses, men, on heaps together lie: END
BEGIN NOW Confus'd the fight, and more confus'd the cry. END
BEGIN NOW Orsilochus, who durst not press too near END
BEGIN NOW Strong Remulus, at distance drove his spear, END
BEGIN NOW And stuck the steel beneath his horse's ear. END
BEGIN NOW The fiery steed, impatient of the wound, END
BEGIN NOW Curvets, and, springing upward with a bound, END
BEGIN NOW His helpless lord cast backward on the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Catillus pierc'd Iolas first; then drew END
BEGIN NOW His reeking lance, and at Herminius threw, END
BEGIN NOW The mighty champion of the Tuscan crew. END
BEGIN NOW His neck and throat unarm'd, his head was bare, END
BEGIN NOW But shaded with a length of yellow hair: END
BEGIN NOW Secure, he fought, expos'd on ev'ry part, END
BEGIN NOW A spacious mark for swords, and for the flying dart. END
BEGIN NOW Across the shoulders came the feather'd wound; END
BEGIN NOW Transfix'd he fell, and doubled to the ground. END
BEGIN NOW The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed, END
BEGIN NOW And death with honor sought on either side. END
BEGIN NOW Resistless thro' the war Camilla rode, END
BEGIN NOW In danger unappall'd, and pleas'd with blood. END
BEGIN NOW One side was bare for her exerted breast; END
BEGIN NOW One shoulder with her painted quiver press'd. END
BEGIN NOW Now from afar her fatal jav'lins play; END
BEGIN NOW Now with her ax's edge she hews her way: END
BEGIN NOW Diana's arms upon her shoulder sound; END
BEGIN NOW And when, too closely press'd, she quits the ground, END
BEGIN NOW From her bent bow she sends a backward wound. END
BEGIN NOW Her maids, in martial pomp, on either side, END
BEGIN NOW Larina, Tulla, fierce Tarpeia, ride: END
BEGIN NOW Italians all; in peace, their queen's delight; END
BEGIN NOW In war, the bold companions of the fight. END
BEGIN NOW So march'd the Tracian Amazons of old, END
BEGIN NOW When Thermodon with bloody billows roll'd: END
BEGIN NOW Such troops as these in shining arms were seen, END
BEGIN NOW When Theseus met in fight their maiden queen: END
BEGIN NOW Such to the field Penthisilea led, END
BEGIN NOW From the fierce virgin when the Grecians fled; END
BEGIN NOW With such, return'd triumphant from the war, END
BEGIN NOW Her maids with cries attend the lofty car; END
BEGIN NOW They clash with manly force their moony shields; END
BEGIN NOW With female shouts resound the Phrygian fields. END
BEGIN NOW Who foremost, and who last, heroic maid, END
BEGIN NOW On the cold earth were by thy courage laid? END
BEGIN NOW Thy spear, of mountain ash, Eumenius first, END
BEGIN NOW With fury driv'n, from side to side transpierc'd: END
BEGIN NOW A purple stream came spouting from the wound; END
BEGIN NOW Bath'd in his blood he lies, and bites the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Liris and Pegasus at once she slew: END
BEGIN NOW The former, as the slacken'd reins he drew END
BEGIN NOW Of his faint steed; the latter, as he stretch'd END
BEGIN NOW His arm to prop his friend, the jav'lin reach'd. END
BEGIN NOW By the same weapon, sent from the same hand, END
BEGIN NOW Both fall together, and both spurn the sand. END
BEGIN NOW Amastrus next is added to the slain: END
BEGIN NOW The rest in rout she follows o'er the plain: END
BEGIN NOW And Chromis, at full speed her fury shun. END
BEGIN NOW Of all her deadly darts, not one she lost; END
BEGIN NOW Each was attended with a Trojan ghost. END
BEGIN NOW Young Ornithus bestrode a hunter steed, END
BEGIN NOW Swift for the chase, and of Apulian breed. END
BEGIN NOW Him from afar she spied, in arms unknown: END
BEGIN NOW O'er his broad back an ox's hide was thrown; END
BEGIN NOW His helm a wolf, whose gaping jaws were spread END
BEGIN NOW A cov'ring for his cheeks, and grinn'd around his head, END
BEGIN NOW He clench'd within his hand an iron prong, END
BEGIN NOW And tower'd above the rest, conspicuous in the throng. END
BEGIN NOW Him soon she singled from the flying train, END
BEGIN NOW And slew with ease; then thus insults the slain: END
BEGIN NOW Vain hunter, didst thou think thro' woods to chase END
BEGIN NOW The savage herd, a vile and trembling race? END
BEGIN NOW Here cease thy vaunts, and own my victory: END
BEGIN NOW A woman warrior was too strong for thee. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, if the ghosts demand the conqu'ror's name, END
BEGIN NOW Confessing great Camilla, save thy shame. END
BEGIN NOW Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew, END
BEGIN NOW The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew; END
BEGIN NOW But Butes breast to breast: the spear descends END
BEGIN NOW Above the gorget, where his helmet ends, END
BEGIN NOW And o'er the shield which his left side defends. END
BEGIN NOW Orsilochus and she their courses ply: END
BEGIN NOW He seems to follow, and she seems to fly; END
BEGIN NOW But in a narrower ring she makes the race; END
BEGIN NOW And then he flies, and she pursues the chase. END
BEGIN NOW Gath'ring at length on her deluded foe, END
BEGIN NOW She swings her ax, and rises to the blow END
BEGIN NOW Full on the helm behind, with such a sway END
BEGIN NOW The weapon falls, the riven steel gives way: END
BEGIN NOW He groans, he roars, he sues in vain for grace; END
BEGIN NOW Brains, mingled with his blood, besmear his face. END
BEGIN NOW Astonish'd Aunus just arrives by chance, END
BEGIN NOW To see his fall; nor farther dares advance; END
BEGIN NOW But, fixing on the horrid maid his eye, END
BEGIN NOW He stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly; END
BEGIN NOW Yet, like a true Ligurian, born to cheat, END
BEGIN NOW (At least while fortune favor'd his deceit,) END
BEGIN NOW Cries out aloud: "What courage have you shown, END
BEGIN NOW Who trust your courser's strength, and not your own? END
BEGIN NOW Forego the vantage of your horse, alight, END
BEGIN NOW And then on equal terms begin the fight: END
BEGIN NOW It shall be seen, weak woman, what you can, END
BEGIN NOW When, foot to foot, you combat with a man, END
BEGIN NOW He said. She glows with anger and disdain, END
BEGIN NOW Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain, END
BEGIN NOW And leaves her horse at large among her train; END
BEGIN NOW With her drawn sword defies him to the field, END
BEGIN NOW And, marching, lifts aloft her maiden shield. END
BEGIN NOW The youth, who thought his cunning did succeed, END
BEGIN NOW Reins round his horse, and urges all his speed; END
BEGIN NOW Adds the remembrance of the spur, and hides END
BEGIN NOW The goring rowels in his bleeding sides. END
BEGIN NOW Vain fool, and coward!" cries the lofty maid, END
BEGIN NOW Caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid! END
BEGIN NOW On others practice thy Ligurian arts; END
BEGIN NOW Thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts END
BEGIN NOW Are lost on me: nor shalt thou safe retire, END
BEGIN NOW With vaunting lies, to thy fallacious sire. END
BEGIN NOW At this, so fast her flying feet she sped, END
BEGIN NOW That soon she strain'd beyond his horse's head: END
BEGIN NOW Then turning short, at once she seiz'd the rein, END
BEGIN NOW And laid the boaster grov'ling on the plain. END
BEGIN NOW Not with more ease the falcon, from above, END
BEGIN NOW Trusses in middle air the trembling dove, END
BEGIN NOW Then plumes the prey, in her strong pounces bound: END
BEGIN NOW The feathers, foul with blood, come tumbling to the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Now mighty Jove, from his superior height, END
BEGIN NOW With his broad eye surveys th' unequal fight. END
BEGIN NOW He fires the breast of Tarchon with disdain, END
BEGIN NOW And sends him to redeem th' abandon'd plain. END
BEGIN NOW Betwixt the broken ranks the Tuscan rides, END
BEGIN NOW And these encourages, and those he chides; END
BEGIN NOW Recalls each leader, by his name, from flight; END
BEGIN NOW Renews their ardor, and restores the fight. END
BEGIN NOW What panic fear has seiz'd your souls? O shame, END
BEGIN NOW O brand perpetual of th' Etrurian name! END
BEGIN NOW Cowards incurable, a woman's hand END
BEGIN NOW Drives, breaks, and scatters your ignoble band! END
BEGIN NOW Now cast away the sword, and quit the shield! END
BEGIN NOW What use of weapons which you dare not wield? END
BEGIN NOW Not thus you fly your female foes by night, END
BEGIN NOW Nor shun the feast, when the full bowls invite; END
BEGIN NOW When to fat off'rings the glad augur calls, END
BEGIN NOW And the shrill hornpipe sounds to bacchanals. END
BEGIN NOW These are your studied cares, your lewd delight: END
BEGIN NOW Swift to debauch, but slow to manly fight. END
BEGIN NOW Thus having said, he spurs amid the foes, END
BEGIN NOW Not managing the life he meant to lose. END
BEGIN NOW The first he found he seiz'd with headlong haste, END
BEGIN NOW In his strong gripe, and clasp'd around the waist; END
BEGIN NOW 'T was Venulus, whom from his horse he tore, END
BEGIN NOW And, laid athwart his own, in triumph bore. END
BEGIN NOW Loud shouts ensue; the Latins turn their eyes, END
BEGIN NOW And view th' unusual sight with vast surprise. END
BEGIN NOW The fiery Tarchon, flying o'er the plains, END
BEGIN NOW Press'd in his arms the pond'rous prey sustains; END
BEGIN NOW Then, with his shorten'd spear, explores around END
BEGIN NOW His jointed arms, to fix a deadly wound. END
BEGIN NOW Nor less the captive struggles for his life: END
BEGIN NOW He writhes his body to prolong the strife, END
BEGIN NOW And, fencing for his naked throat, exerts END
BEGIN NOW His utmost vigor, and the point averts. END
BEGIN NOW So stoops the yellow eagle from on high, END
BEGIN NOW And bears a speckled serpent thro' the sky, END
BEGIN NOW Fast'ning his crooked talons on the prey: END
BEGIN NOW The pris'ner hisses thro' the liquid way; END
BEGIN NOW Resists the royal hawk; and, tho' oppress'd, END
BEGIN NOW She fights in volumes, and erects her crest: END
BEGIN NOW Turn'd to her foe, she stiffens ev'ry scale, END
BEGIN NOW And shoots her forky tongue, and whisks her threat'ning tail. END
BEGIN NOW Against the victor, all defense is weak: END
BEGIN NOW Th' imperial bird still plies her with his beak; END
BEGIN NOW He tears her bowels, and her breast he gores; END
BEGIN NOW Then claps his pinions, and securely soars. END
BEGIN NOW Thus, thro' the midst of circling enemies, END
BEGIN NOW Strong Tarchon snatch'd and bore away his prize. END
BEGIN NOW The Tyrrhene troops, that shrunk before, now press END
BEGIN NOW The Latins, and presume the like success. END
BEGIN NOW Then Aruns, doom'd to death, his arts assay'd, END
BEGIN NOW To murther, unespied, the Volscian maid: END
BEGIN NOW This way and that his winding course he bends, END
BEGIN NOW And, whereso'er she turns, her steps attends. END
BEGIN NOW When she retires victorious from the chase, END
BEGIN NOW He wheels about with care, and shifts his place; END
BEGIN NOW When, rushing on, she seeks her foes flight, END
BEGIN NOW He keeps aloof, but keeps her still in sight: END
BEGIN NOW He threats, and trembles, trying ev'ry way, END
BEGIN NOW Unseen to kill, and safely to betray. END
BEGIN NOW Chloreus, the priest of Cybele, from far, END
BEGIN NOW Glitt'ring in Phrygian arms amidst the war, END
BEGIN NOW Was by the virgin view'd. The steed he press'd END
BEGIN NOW Was proud with trappings, and his brawny chest END
BEGIN NOW With scales of gilded brass was cover'd o'er; END
BEGIN NOW A robe of Tyrian dye the rider wore. END
BEGIN NOW With deadly wounds he gall'd the distant foe; END
BEGIN NOW Gnossian his shafts, and Lycian was his bow: END
BEGIN NOW A golden helm his front and head surrounds END
BEGIN NOW A gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds. END
BEGIN NOW Gold, weav'd with linen, on his thighs he wore, END
BEGIN NOW With flowers of needlework distinguish'd o'er, END
BEGIN NOW With golden buckles bound, and gather'd up before. END
BEGIN NOW Him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Fond and ambitious of so rich a prize, END
BEGIN NOW Or that the temple might his trophies hold, END
BEGIN NOW Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold. END
BEGIN NOW Blind in her haste, she chases him alone. END
BEGIN NOW And seeks his life, regardless of her own. END
BEGIN NOW This lucky moment the sly traitor chose: END
BEGIN NOW Then, starting from his ambush, up he rose, END
BEGIN NOW And threw, but first to Heav'n address'd his vows: END
BEGIN NOW O patron of Socrates' high abodes, END
BEGIN NOW Phoebus, the ruling pow'r among the gods, END
BEGIN NOW Whom first we serve, whole woods of unctuous pine END
BEGIN NOW Are fell'd for thee, and to thy glory shine; END
BEGIN NOW By thee protected with our naked soles, END
BEGIN NOW Thro' flames unsing'd we march, and tread the kindled coals END
BEGIN NOW Give me, propitious pow'r, to wash away END
BEGIN NOW The stains of this dishonorable day: END
BEGIN NOW Nor spoils, nor triumph, from the fact I claim, END
BEGIN NOW But with my future actions trust my fame. END
BEGIN NOW Let me, by stealth, this female plague o'ercome, END
BEGIN NOW And from the field return inglorious home. END
BEGIN NOW Apollo heard, and, granting half his pray'r, END
BEGIN NOW Shuffled in winds the rest, and toss'd in empty air. END
BEGIN NOW He gives the death desir'd; his safe return END
BEGIN NOW By southern tempests to the seas is borne. END
BEGIN NOW Now, when the jav'lin whizz'd along the skies, END
BEGIN NOW Both armies on Camilla turn'd their eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Directed by the sound. Of either host, END
BEGIN NOW Th' unhappy virgin, tho' concern'd the most, END
BEGIN NOW Was only deaf; so greedy was she bent END
BEGIN NOW On golden spoils, and on her prey intent; END
BEGIN NOW Till in her pap the winged weapon stood END
BEGIN NOW Infix'd, and deeply drunk the purple blood. END
BEGIN NOW Her sad attendants hasten to sustain END
BEGIN NOW Their dying lady, drooping on the plain. END
BEGIN NOW Far from their sight the trembling Aruns flies, END
BEGIN NOW With beating heart, and fear confus'd with joys; END
BEGIN NOW Nor dares he farther to pursue his blow, END
BEGIN NOW Or ev'n to bear the sight of his expiring foe. END
BEGIN NOW As, when the wolf has torn a bullock's hide END
BEGIN NOW At unawares, or ranch'd a shepherd's side, END
BEGIN NOW Conscious of his audacious deed, he flies, END
BEGIN NOW And claps his quiv'ring tail between his thighs: END
BEGIN NOW So, speeding once, the wretch no more attends, END
BEGIN NOW But, spurring forward, herds among his friends. END
BEGIN NOW She wrench'd the jav'lin with her dying hands, END
BEGIN NOW But wedg'd within her breast the weapon stands; END
BEGIN NOW The wood she draws, the steely point remains; END
BEGIN NOW She staggers in her seat with agonizing pains: END
BEGIN NOW (A gath'ring mist o'erclouds her cheerful eyes, END
BEGIN NOW And from her cheeks the rosy color flies:) END
BEGIN NOW Then turns to her, whom of her female train END
BEGIN NOW She trusted most, and thus she speaks with pain: END
BEGIN NOW Acca, 't is past! he swims before my sight, END
BEGIN NOW Inexorable Death; and claims his right. END
BEGIN NOW Bear my last words to Turnus; fly with speed, END
BEGIN NOW And bid him timely to my charge succeed, END
BEGIN NOW Repel the Trojans, and the town relieve: END
BEGIN NOW Farewell! and in this kiss my parting breath receive. END
BEGIN NOW She said, and, sliding, sunk upon the plain: END
BEGIN NOW Dying, her open'd hand forsakes the rein; END
BEGIN NOW Short, and more short, she pants; by slow degrees END
BEGIN NOW Her mind the passage from her body frees. END
BEGIN NOW She drops her sword; she nods her plumy crest, END
BEGIN NOW Her drooping head declining on her breast: END
BEGIN NOW In the last sigh her struggling soul expires, END
BEGIN NOW And, murm'ring with disdain, to Stygian sounds retires. END
BEGIN NOW A shout, that struck the golden stars, ensued; END
BEGIN NOW Despair and rage the languish'd fight renew'd. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan troops and Tuscans, in a line, END
BEGIN NOW Advance to charge; the mix'd Arcadians join. END
BEGIN NOW But Cynthia's maid, high seated, from afar END
BEGIN NOW Surveys the field, and fortune of the war, END
BEGIN NOW Unmov'd a while, till, prostrate on the plain, END
BEGIN NOW Welt'ring in blood, she sees Camilla slain, END
BEGIN NOW And, round her corpse, of friends and foes a fighting train. END
BEGIN NOW Then, from the bottom of her breast, she drew END
BEGIN NOW A mournful sigh, and these sad words ensue: END
BEGIN NOW Too dear a fine, ah much lamented maid, END
BEGIN NOW For warring with the Trojans, thou hast paid! END
BEGIN NOW Nor aught avail'd, in this unhappy strife, END
BEGIN NOW Diana's sacred arms, to save thy life. END
BEGIN NOW Yet unreveng'd thy goddess will not leave END
BEGIN NOW Her vot'ry's death, nor; with vain sorrow grieve. END
BEGIN NOW Branded the wretch, and be his name abhorr'd; END
BEGIN NOW But after ages shall thy praise record. END
BEGIN NOW Th' inglorious coward soon shall press the plain: END
BEGIN NOW Thus vows thy queen, and thus the Fates ordain. END
BEGIN NOW High o'er the field there stood a hilly mound, END
BEGIN NOW Sacred the place, and spread with oaks around, END
BEGIN NOW Where, in a marble tomb, Dercennus lay, END
BEGIN NOW A king that once in Latium bore the sway. END
BEGIN NOW The beauteous Opis thither bent her flight, END
BEGIN NOW To mark the traitor Aruns from the height. END
BEGIN NOW Him in refulgent arms she soon espied, END
BEGIN NOW Swoln with success; and loudly thus she cried: END
BEGIN NOW Thy backward steps, vain boaster, are too late; END
BEGIN NOW Turn like a man, at length, and meet thy fate. END
BEGIN NOW Charg'd with my message, to Camilla go, END
BEGIN NOW And say I sent thee to the shades below, END
BEGIN NOW An honor undeserv'd from Cynthia's bow. END
BEGIN NOW She said, and from her quiver chose with speed END
BEGIN NOW The winged shaft, predestin'd for the deed; END
BEGIN NOW Then to the stubborn yew her strength applied, END
BEGIN NOW Till the far distant horns approach'd on either side. END
BEGIN NOW The bowstring touch'd her breast, so strong she drew; END
BEGIN NOW Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew. END
BEGIN NOW At once the twanging bow and sounding dart END
BEGIN NOW The traitor heard, and felt the point within his heart. END
BEGIN NOW Him, beating with his heels in pangs of death, END
BEGIN NOW His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath. END
BEGIN NOW The conqu'ring damsel, with expanded wings, END
BEGIN NOW The welcome message to her mistress brings. END
BEGIN NOW Their leader lost, the Volscians quit the field, END
BEGIN NOW And, unsustain'd, the chiefs of Turnus yield. END
BEGIN NOW The frighted soldiers, when their captains fly, END
BEGIN NOW More on their speed than on their strength rely. END
BEGIN NOW Confus'd in flight, they bear each other down, END
BEGIN NOW And spur their horses headlong to the town. END
BEGIN NOW Driv'n by their foes, and to their fears resign'd, END
BEGIN NOW Not once they turn, but take their wounds behind. END
BEGIN NOW These drop the shield, and those the lance forego, END
BEGIN NOW Or on their shoulders bear the slacken'd bow. END
BEGIN NOW The hoofs of horses, with a rattling sound, END
BEGIN NOW Beat short and thick, and shake the rotten ground. END
BEGIN NOW Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky, END
BEGIN NOW And o'er the darken'd walls and rampires fly. END
BEGIN NOW The trembling matrons, from their lofty stands, END
BEGIN NOW Rend heav'n with female shrieks, and wring their hands. END
BEGIN NOW All pressing on, pursuers and pursued, END
BEGIN NOW Are crush'd in crowds, a mingled multitude. END
BEGIN NOW Some happy few escape: the throng too late END
BEGIN NOW Rush on for entrance, till they choke the gate. END
BEGIN NOW Ev'n in the sight of home, the wretched sire END
BEGIN NOW Looks on, and sees his helpless son expire. END
BEGIN NOW Then, in a fright, the folding gates they close, END
BEGIN NOW But leave their friends excluded with their foes. END
BEGIN NOW The vanquish'd cry; the victors loudly shout; END
BEGIN NOW 'T is terror all within, and slaughter all without. END
BEGIN NOW Blind in their fear, they bounce against the wall, END
BEGIN NOW Or, to the moats pursued, precipitate their fall. END
BEGIN NOW The Latian virgins, valiant with despair, END
BEGIN NOW Arm'd on the tow'rs, the common danger share: END
BEGIN NOW So much of zeal their country's cause inspir'd; END
BEGIN NOW So much Camilla's great example fir'd. END
BEGIN NOW Poles, sharpen'd in the flames, from high they throw, END
BEGIN NOW With imitated darts, to gall the foe. END
BEGIN NOW Their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath, END
BEGIN NOW And crowd each other to be first in death. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime to Turnus, ambush'd in the shade, END
BEGIN NOW With heavy tidings came th' unhappy maid: END
BEGIN NOW The Volscians overthrown, Camilla kill'd; END
BEGIN NOW The foes, entirely masters of the field, END
BEGIN NOW Like a resistless flood, come rolling on: END
BEGIN NOW The cry goes off the plain, and thickens to the town. END
BEGIN NOW Inflam'd with rage, (for so the Furies fire END
BEGIN NOW The Daunian's breast, and so the Fates require,) END
BEGIN NOW He leaves the hilly pass, the woods in vain END
BEGIN NOW Possess'd, and downward issues on the plain. END
BEGIN NOW Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed END
BEGIN NOW From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed. END
BEGIN NOW Thro' the black forest and the ferny brake, END
BEGIN NOW Unknowingly secure, their way they take; END
BEGIN NOW From the rough mountains to the plain descend, END
BEGIN NOW And there, in order drawn, their line extend. END
BEGIN NOW Both armies now in open fields are seen; END
BEGIN NOW Nor far the distance of the space between. END
BEGIN NOW Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees, END
BEGIN NOW Thro' smoking fields, his hast'ning enemies; END
BEGIN NOW And Turnus views the Trojans in array, END
BEGIN NOW And hears th' approaching horses proudly neigh. END
BEGIN NOW Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join'd; END
BEGIN NOW But westward to the sea the sun declin'd. END
BEGIN NOW Intrench'd before the town both armies lie, END
BEGIN NOW While Night with sable wings involves the sky. END
BEGIN NOW When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field, END
BEGIN NOW Their armies broken, and their courage quell'd, END
BEGIN NOW Himself become the mark of public spite, END
BEGIN NOW His honor question'd for the promis'd fight; END
BEGIN NOW The more he was with vulgar hate oppress'd, END
BEGIN NOW The more his fury boil'd within his breast: END
BEGIN NOW He rous'd his vigor for the last debate, END
BEGIN NOW And rais'd his haughty soul to meet his fate. END
BEGIN NOW As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase, END
BEGIN NOW He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace; END
BEGIN NOW But, if the pointed jav'lin pierce his side, END
BEGIN NOW The lordly beast returns with double pride: END
BEGIN NOW He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain; END
BEGIN NOW His sides he lashes, and erects his mane: END
BEGIN NOW So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire, END
BEGIN NOW Thro' his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire. END
BEGIN NOW Trembling with rage, around the court he ran, END
BEGIN NOW At length approach'd the king, and thus began: END
BEGIN NOW No more excuses or delays: I stand END
BEGIN NOW In arms prepar'd to combat, hand to hand, END
BEGIN NOW This base deserter of his native land. END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan, by his word, is bound to take END
BEGIN NOW The same conditions which himself did make. END
BEGIN NOW Renew the truce; the solemn rites prepare, END
BEGIN NOW And to my single virtue trust the war. END
BEGIN NOW The Latians unconcern'd shall see the fight; END
BEGIN NOW This arm unaided shall assert your right: END
BEGIN NOW Then, if my prostrate body press the plain, END
BEGIN NOW To him the crown and beauteous bride remain. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the king sedately thus replied: END
BEGIN NOW Brave youth, the more your valor has been tried, END
BEGIN NOW The more becomes it us, with due respect, END
BEGIN NOW To weigh the chance of war, which you neglect. END
BEGIN NOW You want not wealth, or a successive throne, END
BEGIN NOW Or cities which your arms have made your own: END
BEGIN NOW My towns and treasures are at your command, END
BEGIN NOW And stor'd with blooming beauties is my land; END
BEGIN NOW Laurentum more than one Lavinia sees, END
BEGIN NOW Unmarried, fair, of noble families. END
BEGIN NOW Now let me speak, and you with patience hear, END
BEGIN NOW Things which perhaps may grate a lover's ear, END
BEGIN NOW But sound advice, proceeding from a heart END
BEGIN NOW Sincerely yours, and free from fraudful art. END
BEGIN NOW The gods, by signs, have manifestly shown, END
BEGIN NOW No prince Italian born should heir my throne: END
BEGIN NOW Oft have our augurs, in prediction skill'd, END
BEGIN NOW And oft our priests, foreign son reveal'd. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, won by worth that cannot be withstood, END
BEGIN NOW Brib'd by my kindness to my kindred blood, END
BEGIN NOW Urg'd by my wife, who would not be denied, END
BEGIN NOW I promis'd my Lavinia for your bride: END
BEGIN NOW Her from her plighted lord by force I took; END
BEGIN NOW All ties of treaties, and of honor, broke: END
BEGIN NOW On your account I wag'd an impious war- END
BEGIN NOW With what success, 't is needless to declare; END
BEGIN NOW I and my subjects feel, and you have had your share. END
BEGIN NOW Twice vanquish'd while in bloody fields we strive, END
BEGIN NOW Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive: END
BEGIN NOW The rolling flood runs warm with human gore; END
BEGIN NOW The bones of Latians blanch the neighb'ring shore. END
BEGIN NOW Why put I not an end to this debate, END
BEGIN NOW Still unresolv'd, and still a slave to fate? END
BEGIN NOW If Turnus' death a lasting peace can give, END
BEGIN NOW Why should I not procure it whilst you live? END
BEGIN NOW Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray, END
BEGIN NOW What would my kinsmen the Rutulians say? END
BEGIN NOW And, should you fall in fight, (which Heav'n defend!) END
BEGIN NOW How curse the cause which hasten'd to his end END
BEGIN NOW The daughter's lover and the father's friend? END
BEGIN NOW Weigh in your mind the various chance of war; END
BEGIN NOW Pity your parent's age, and ease his care. END
BEGIN NOW Such balmy words he pour'd, but all in vain: END
BEGIN NOW The proffer'd med'cine but provok'd the pain. END
BEGIN NOW The wrathful youth, disdaining the relief, END
BEGIN NOW With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief: END
BEGIN NOW The care, O best of fathers, which you take END
BEGIN NOW For my concerns, at my desire forsake. END
BEGIN NOW Permit me not to languish out my days, END
BEGIN NOW But make the best exchange of life for praise. END
BEGIN NOW This arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize; END
BEGIN NOW And the blood follows, where the weapon flies. END
BEGIN NOW His goddess mother is not near, to shroud END
BEGIN NOW The flying coward with an empty cloud. END
BEGIN NOW But now the queen, who fear'd for Turnus' life, END
BEGIN NOW And loath'd the hard conditions of the strife, END
BEGIN NOW Held him by force; and, dying in his death, END
BEGIN NOW In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath: END
BEGIN NOW O Turnus, I adjure thee by these tears, END
BEGIN NOW And whate'er price Amata's honor bears END
BEGIN NOW Within thy breast, since thou art all my hope, END
BEGIN NOW My sickly mind's repose, my sinking age's prop; END
BEGIN NOW Since on the safety of thy life alone END
BEGIN NOW Depends Latinus, and the Latian throne: END
BEGIN NOW Refuse me not this one, this only pray'r, END
BEGIN NOW To waive the combat, and pursue the war. END
BEGIN NOW Whatever chance attends this fatal strife, END
BEGIN NOW Think it includes, in thine, Amata's life. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot live a slave, or see my throne END
BEGIN NOW Usurp'd by strangers or a Trojan son. END
BEGIN NOW At this, a flood of tears Lavinia shed; END
BEGIN NOW A crimson blush her beauteous face o'erspread, END
BEGIN NOW Varying her cheeks by turns with white and red. END
BEGIN NOW The driving colors, never at a stay, END
BEGIN NOW Run here and there, and flush, and fade away. END
BEGIN NOW Delightful change! Thus Indian iv'ry shows, END
BEGIN NOW Which with the bord'ring paint of purple glows; END
BEGIN NOW Or lilies damask'd by the neighb'ring rose. END
BEGIN NOW The lover gaz'd, and, burning with desire, END
BEGIN NOW The more he look'd, the more he fed the fire: END
BEGIN NOW Revenge, and jealous rage, and secret spite, END
BEGIN NOW Roll in his breast, and rouse him to the fight. END
BEGIN NOW Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes, END
BEGIN NOW Firm to his first intent, he thus replies: END
BEGIN NOW O mother, do not by your tears prepare END
BEGIN NOW Such boding omens, and prejudge the war. END
BEGIN NOW Resolv'd on fight, I am no longer free END
BEGIN NOW To shun my death, if Heav'n my death decree. END
BEGIN NOW Then turning to the herald, thus pursues: END
BEGIN NOW Go, greet the Trojan with ungrateful news; END
BEGIN NOW Denounce from me, that, when to-morrow's light END
BEGIN NOW Shall gild the heav'ns, he need not urge the fight; END
BEGIN NOW The Trojan and Rutulian troops no more END
BEGIN NOW Shall dye, with mutual blood, the Latian shore: END
BEGIN NOW Our single swords the quarrel shall decide, END
BEGIN NOW And to the victor be the beauteous bride. END
BEGIN NOW He said, and striding on, with speedy pace, END
BEGIN NOW He sought his coursers of the Thracian race. END
BEGIN NOW At his approach they toss their heads on high, END
BEGIN NOW And, proudly neighing, promise victory. END
BEGIN NOW The sires of these Orythia sent from far, END
BEGIN NOW To grace Pilumnus, when he went to war. END
BEGIN NOW The drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white, END
BEGIN NOW Nor northern winds in fleetness match'd their flight. END
BEGIN NOW Officious grooms stand ready by his side; END
BEGIN NOW And some with combs their flowing manes divide, END
BEGIN NOW And others stroke their chests and gently soothe their pride. END
BEGIN NOW He sheath'd his limbs in arms; a temper'd mass END
BEGIN NOW Of golden metal those, and mountain brass. END
BEGIN NOW Then to his head his glitt'ring helm he tied, END
BEGIN NOW And girt his faithful fauchion to his side. END
BEGIN NOW In his Aetnaean forge, the God of Fire END
BEGIN NOW That fauchion labor'd for the hero's sire; END
BEGIN NOW Immortal keenness on the blade bestow'd, END
BEGIN NOW And plung'd it hissing in the Stygian flood. END
BEGIN NOW Propp'd on a pillar, which the ceiling bore, END
BEGIN NOW Was plac'd the lance Auruncan Actor wore; END
BEGIN NOW Which with such force he brandish'd in his hand, END
BEGIN NOW The tough ash trembled like an osier wand: END
BEGIN NOW Then cried: "O pond'rous spoil of Actor slain, END
BEGIN NOW And never yet by Turnus toss'd in vain, END
BEGIN NOW Fail not this day thy wonted force; but go, END
BEGIN NOW Sent by this hand, to pierce the Trojan foe! END
BEGIN NOW Give me to tear his corslet from his breast, END
BEGIN NOW And from that eunuch head to rend the crest; END
BEGIN NOW Dragg'd in the dust, his frizzled hair to soil, END
BEGIN NOW Hot from the vexing ir'n, and smear'd with fragrant oil! END
BEGIN NOW Thus while he raves, from his wide nostrils flies END
BEGIN NOW A fiery steam, and sparkles from his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW So fares the bull in his lov'd female's sight: END
BEGIN NOW Proudly he bellows, and preludes the fight; END
BEGIN NOW He tries his goring horns against a tree, END
BEGIN NOW And meditates his absent enemy; END
BEGIN NOW He pushes at the winds; he digs the strand END
BEGIN NOW With his black hoofs, and spurns the yellow sand. END
BEGIN NOW Nor less the Trojan, in his Lemnian arms, END
BEGIN NOW To future fight his manly courage warms: END
BEGIN NOW He whets his fury, and with joy prepares END
BEGIN NOW To terminate at once the ling'ring wars; END
BEGIN NOW To cheer his chiefs and tender son, relates END
BEGIN NOW What Heav'n had promis'd, and expounds the fates. END
BEGIN NOW Then to the Latian king he sends, to cease END
BEGIN NOW The rage of arms, and ratify the peace. END
BEGIN NOW The morn ensuing, from the mountain's height, END
BEGIN NOW Had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light; END
BEGIN NOW Th' ethereal coursers, bounding from the sea, END
BEGIN NOW From out their flaming nostrils breath'd the day; END
BEGIN NOW When now the Trojan and Rutulian guard, END
BEGIN NOW In friendly labor join'd, the list prepar'd. END
